0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.200
Okie dokie welcome to prime time this is the half hour segment where I answer

2
0:00:04.200 --> 0:00:07.560
questions from you guys so drop questions in the questions and help

3
0:00:07.560 --> 0:00:11.080
channel. Go ahead and just ping the role again just let people know that we are

4
0:00:11.080 --> 0:00:15.520
getting started and then I'll get started with the first question which

5
0:00:15.520 --> 0:00:19.680
has been queued up here by Zetaphor. Thank you for that question. They are

6
0:00:19.680 --> 0:00:23.160
asking hey prime we're all noticing some interesting arrow logs showing up in our

7
0:00:23.160 --> 0:00:28.280
temp folder indicating the use of caffe2, a machine learning library these

8
0:00:28.280 --> 0:00:31.360
spaces to be correlated with us running our Neos clients and only started

9
0:00:31.360 --> 0:00:36.120
around a week ago. Do you have any insight on this discussion here? Are you

10
0:00:36.120 --> 0:00:40.640
sure you can't find that like anywhere else? We haven't updated any of our like

11
0:00:40.640 --> 0:00:44.400
libraries or anything. Alright let me go to my temp folder like it's not that I

12
0:00:44.400 --> 0:00:46.840
don't believe you guys it's just that I'm trying to find the fastest way to

13
0:00:46.840 --> 0:00:56.400
get an answer here and so if I have files as well data doesn't exist for

14
0:00:56.400 --> 0:01:02.760
some reason. Local temp just in local temp like no other folder or anything

15
0:01:02.760 --> 0:01:07.760
like in the root of local temp yeah I got them. Weird. Alright I'll have to dig

16
0:01:07.760 --> 0:01:12.320
into that one some more it's a good on the ping there I did see the ping come

17
0:01:12.320 --> 0:01:17.880
in before but we'll start it with like I'll dig into this after after this

18
0:01:17.880 --> 0:01:21.120
office hours segment we'll move on to questions if they are there if they're

19
0:01:21.120 --> 0:01:25.000
not I'll just mute and dig into this way let's take a look there are no

20
0:01:25.000 --> 0:01:28.200
additional questions right now so please get some questions into the questions

21
0:01:28.200 --> 0:01:32.520
and helps channel not the questions help channel sorry the questions prime time

22
0:01:32.520 --> 0:01:35.000
thread within the office hours text channel I'll get to them as soon as I

23
0:01:35.000 --> 0:01:39.400
can whilst we wait for questions I'll be looking into this log awareness I thank

24
0:01:39.400 --> 0:01:43.640
you I don't answer questions about food it's just questions about Neos so one of

25
0:01:43.640 --> 0:01:46.920
things about these log files is that is the temp directory and that the temp

26
0:01:46.920 --> 0:01:56.080
directory is bombarded with just absolute bullshit 24-7 so yeah no it's

27
0:01:56.080 --> 0:02:00.040
not so the next question we have from Zetta is it's possible to drive

28
0:02:00.040 --> 0:02:04.160
rotation from a pan of 3d or other 3d components no quaternions are

29
0:02:04.160 --> 0:02:09.880
four-dimensional vectors that are like they have different rules completely

30
0:02:09.880 --> 0:02:13.520
different rules to regular mathematics because of what they need to do and how

31
0:02:13.520 --> 0:02:18.120
they need to work wiggly would be the any way that you could do that honestly

32
0:02:18.120 --> 0:02:24.200
like some form of other components would be better at that point it is float to

33
0:02:24.200 --> 0:02:30.980
Q not float 3 we render it as float Q and sorry we render it as float 3 in the

34
0:02:30.980 --> 0:02:36.640
inspectors because float Q's don't make sense to the average user so we do

35
0:02:36.640 --> 0:02:41.720
Euler Euler and interpolation in the in the inspector so that's just a display

36
0:02:41.720 --> 0:02:45.800
thing it's not something that you can like use so just like find a component

37
0:02:45.800 --> 0:02:50.080
that works if look you maybe value gradient drive will be a good way to do

38
0:02:50.080 --> 0:02:55.280
Pana or just use logics the you know the amazing feature that we added to Neos

39
0:02:55.280 --> 0:02:59.360
for you to use that it also says that they didn't using logics in the end for

40
0:02:59.360 --> 0:03:02.160
their rotational issues just great they want to make sure that they weren't

41
0:03:02.160 --> 0:03:05.960
reinventing a component yeah um there are a few like mapper components that

42
0:03:05.960 --> 0:03:10.120
might do it for you but don't worry about like reinventing a component just

43
0:03:10.120 --> 0:03:14.040
just do it whatever way works for you obviously if you need to optimize later

44
0:03:14.040 --> 0:03:18.240
do it but for the most part it'll be okay just reminder for those who are

45
0:03:18.240 --> 0:03:22.440
just joining or have not heard before this is office hours if your questions

46
0:03:22.440 --> 0:03:25.760
please drop them in the office hours text chats thread for this particular

47
0:03:25.760 --> 0:03:29.040
session that's a few channels about the one that you're currently in I'll ask

48
0:03:29.040 --> 0:03:32.400
them in the order that they appear any questions will do thank you so no

49
0:03:32.400 --> 0:03:35.520
question here from Zari who asks is there a way to load assets when joining

50
0:03:35.520 --> 0:03:39.360
a world before one actually spawns into it for the chugging lagging when one

51
0:03:39.360 --> 0:03:43.040
joints more properly session yes you need to customize it yourself though or

52
0:03:43.040 --> 0:03:48.120
build a tool to do it there is a functionality in the open world logics

53
0:03:48.120 --> 0:03:52.200
node which will prevent loading into like switching until the world is ready

54
0:03:52.200 --> 0:03:57.480
I have heard it can be flaky but people use a lot for portals and well

55
0:03:57.480 --> 0:04:01.120
transition systems to take a look at that there we get Lex has made a world

56
0:04:01.120 --> 0:04:05.040
preloader which is the the tool that I was referring to moving almost stars as

57
0:04:05.040 --> 0:04:07.920
a question is there any way to get a single float value to drive let's say

58
0:04:07.920 --> 0:04:13.120
just a Y value in a float to with just components of needs to be done in logic

59
0:04:13.120 --> 0:04:18.080
that's fun too well in logic you would just do a pack XYZ or a pack XY to get

60
0:04:18.080 --> 0:04:22.960
it into the appropriate data type that you wish to get into for non logics

61
0:04:22.960 --> 0:04:27.520
methodologies look at the mapper component so there's a transform drivers

62
0:04:27.520 --> 0:04:31.280
mapper something there those do very specific things which are often not

63
0:04:31.280 --> 0:04:36.280
usable for this situation but like sometimes are if those don't work try

64
0:04:36.280 --> 0:04:40.400
the swizzle drivers which are in relation swizzle drivers or I think

65
0:04:40.400 --> 0:04:44.920
relations yeah the swizzle drivers kind of snuck in mostly because people don't

66
0:04:44.920 --> 0:04:48.360
know what swizzling means it kind of sounds weird

67
0:04:48.360 --> 0:04:54.840
swizzling is really much what you're after though it just means rearranging

68
0:04:54.840 --> 0:04:58.600
like a vector a little bit don't answer questions about cheese in the prime time

69
0:04:58.600 --> 0:05:02.800
office hours I ask questions about Neos what is your favorite type of cheese is

70
0:05:02.800 --> 0:05:06.240
rejected you can search the previous notes for answers to that particular

71
0:05:06.240 --> 0:05:10.960
question for example that's a new cheese question so Fuzzy Fox you'll manage to

72
0:05:10.960 --> 0:05:15.520
get that new cheese question that I haven't had before but we'll go to

73
0:05:15.520 --> 0:05:19.000
pandas question first which is what you like to do on your spare time lost or

74
0:05:19.000 --> 0:05:24.160
Neos I have no spare time on Neos like if I'm not testing random bugs or

75
0:05:24.160 --> 0:05:28.640
helping out people then I'm just trying to chill in the world but often when I'm

76
0:05:28.640 --> 0:05:32.560
trying to chill in a to a world it turns into someone will come in and start

77
0:05:32.560 --> 0:05:36.280
talking about mods or plugins someone will start coming in and talking about

78
0:05:36.280 --> 0:05:40.240
how so-and-so feature of Neos needs to be written because they poked around in

79
0:05:40.240 --> 0:05:43.160
the source code and they found out that they didn't like the way it is written

80
0:05:43.160 --> 0:05:46.800
and I'm right there with you I just can't really do anything about it right

81
0:05:46.800 --> 0:05:52.920
now so maybe don't do that to a Neos team member thanks or someone will come in and

82
0:05:52.920 --> 0:05:56.280
complain about something which is understandable given the current climate

83
0:05:56.280 --> 0:05:59.600
those are kind of like bad interactions but then if people come in and ask

84
0:05:59.600 --> 0:06:02.280
questions that's usually the best interactions right they come in and

85
0:06:02.280 --> 0:06:07.680
they're just like I'm trying to learn how to do X I'm you know I'm trying to

86
0:06:07.680 --> 0:06:11.320
build this avatar make this thing I love those questions right because we're not

87
0:06:11.320 --> 0:06:16.000
like it it's almost like meta conversations about Neos are thrown in

88
0:06:16.000 --> 0:06:18.460
the same bucket as like crypto conversations you know how I'm like no

89
0:06:18.460 --> 0:06:21.720
one wants to talk about crypto and Neos this like signs and various worlds

90
0:06:21.720 --> 0:06:26.560
crypto conversation users will be shot or whatever I want like meta-Neos

91
0:06:26.560 --> 0:06:30.040
discussions to also be in that bucket what do I mean by meta-Neos discussions

92
0:06:30.040 --> 0:06:34.880
I mean discussions about the current situation about the code base about the

93
0:06:34.880 --> 0:06:41.320
lack of certain features about the roadmap about like plans like accepting

94
0:06:41.320 --> 0:06:45.440
Neos at face value and moving forwards with that to build something is my

95
0:06:45.440 --> 0:06:50.200
favorite interaction with other users rather than being in a corner talking

96
0:06:50.200 --> 0:06:53.680
about mods plugins or which part of the code base they'd like to read right if

97
0:06:53.680 --> 0:06:57.440
they could it's all good like I get why you're doing it I'm not faulting you for

98
0:06:57.440 --> 0:07:02.280
it it's just you know I've been working for like 12 hours today and trying to

99
0:07:02.280 --> 0:07:06.600
hit chill out and someone's like this so-and-so thing makes no sense and I'm

100
0:07:06.600 --> 0:07:13.880
like yeah I agree so now jumping down to what's your favorite cheese model that

101
0:07:13.880 --> 0:07:18.040
you've come across so that's actually a cheese sandwich made by sloppy

102
0:07:18.040 --> 0:07:21.800
mcfloppy using the ring of the neolander they just pulled out then area in the

103
0:07:21.800 --> 0:07:24.540
lander they made a cheese sandwich it is in the cheese folder which is in my

104
0:07:24.540 --> 0:07:29.220
public folder art and then cheese that is full of like basically everything

105
0:07:29.220 --> 0:07:35.520
there including cheese wisdom which is a series of audio clips which apanda not

106
0:07:35.520 --> 0:07:40.560
cloud panda recorded with my permission I didn't realize the recording I gave

107
0:07:40.560 --> 0:07:45.000
them permission post afterwards and then I misspelled cheese wisdom very badly in

108
0:07:45.000 --> 0:07:48.080
the folder name so I need to remit the folder by keep forgetting to anyway

109
0:07:48.080 --> 0:07:53.240
there's some funny sound effects in there including explanation of why

110
0:07:53.240 --> 0:07:59.120
platypuses do not have udders or nipples I promise you that audio is in there and

111
0:07:59.120 --> 0:08:02.720
it's interesting because platypuses are mammals which is very confusing when you

112
0:08:02.720 --> 0:08:07.920
look at a platypus it's like that's a duck or a beaver I'm very confused sir

113
0:08:07.920 --> 0:08:10.480
asks have you ever thought about an alt if you haven't trouble in game

114
0:08:10.480 --> 0:08:14.480
recognition I've never used an alt it's just like bad like I understand why

115
0:08:14.480 --> 0:08:21.440
people do it I just like it's it's it's not my my dealio the the gains that you

116
0:08:21.440 --> 0:08:26.640
get are not that much as well because like even though now people don't know

117
0:08:26.640 --> 0:08:30.200
that you're a Neos team member some people will then know that you're a

118
0:08:30.200 --> 0:08:34.400
Neos team member and then you've been decloaked and then even if no one knows

119
0:08:34.400 --> 0:08:38.120
that you're a Neos team member you know you don't speak like for example has

120
0:08:38.120 --> 0:08:42.960
anyone thought maybe froppy is actually frugs they both start with F and froppy

121
0:08:42.960 --> 0:08:47.320
is mute and they never speak and they're really cool and frugs is really cool so

122
0:08:47.320 --> 0:08:53.120
like is froppy frugs or vice versa like who knows anyway that is you know one

123
0:08:53.120 --> 0:08:59.760
way of doing it is being mute but so like even with that right if no one

124
0:08:59.760 --> 0:09:05.200
knows who you are you still have that burden there right so if you're inside a

125
0:09:05.200 --> 0:09:09.840
session and people are complaining then you can still hear that feedback and

126
0:09:09.840 --> 0:09:13.520
internalize that feedback even though you're on your own so it just wouldn't

127
0:09:13.520 --> 0:09:17.720
work out froppy you're cool I've seen froppy and frugs in the same

128
0:09:17.720 --> 0:09:21.280
session so that they're fine unless they're like multi boxing and like you

129
0:09:21.280 --> 0:09:25.840
know splicing their VR into multiple computers at once you know yeah they do

130
0:09:25.840 --> 0:09:32.080
both have two O's let's move forwards on some additional questions sorry says

131
0:09:32.080 --> 0:09:34.400
have you felt that the videos about reading the room have had a tangible

132
0:09:34.400 --> 0:09:36.920
impact on the behavior in Neos or do you wish people would point people more to

133
0:09:36.920 --> 0:09:41.920
them in game I wish people would point people to whatever resource helps them

134
0:09:41.920 --> 0:09:47.200
understand how that sort of avenue of stuff needs to work maybe my video

135
0:09:47.200 --> 0:09:52.200
doesn't work for you for whatever reason and you need some other sort of resource

136
0:09:52.200 --> 0:09:58.640
or mechanism for that I wish we had more I wish had faster ways of doing it as

137
0:09:58.640 --> 0:10:03.040
well a good example of that would be over on VR chat where in the loading

138
0:10:03.040 --> 0:10:06.800
screen they'll put up random messages I'm one of the like your best messages

139
0:10:06.800 --> 0:10:12.160
there is like don't do shit without people's consent or well banya but like

140
0:10:12.160 --> 0:10:16.640
really worthy nicely worded I'd car with exact wording so I was like paraphrasing

141
0:10:16.640 --> 0:10:20.840
there it's a good message right and yeah people don't read it because it's a

142
0:10:20.840 --> 0:10:24.600
loading screen and they kind of just zone out but it's about like making that

143
0:10:24.600 --> 0:10:29.600
information available to people and available in a way that can be consumed

144
0:10:29.600 --> 0:10:33.640
that video might not be like the best way to do that I don't know what the

145
0:10:33.640 --> 0:10:38.160
best way is what I do know though is that that video has led to a lot of

146
0:10:38.160 --> 0:10:40.960
people give me feedback that they have enjoyed it and I also know that has

147
0:10:40.960 --> 0:10:46.240
shaped a lot of people's way of you know interacting with people on Neos which

148
0:10:46.240 --> 0:10:51.400
evidently you know will rub off on some other parts of the population as it sort

149
0:10:51.400 --> 0:10:56.480
of spreads culturally in a sort of tribal way right so it has done good I

150
0:10:56.480 --> 0:11:00.600
just wish there was some mechanism we could do to sort of like you know swoop

151
0:11:00.600 --> 0:11:04.440
down into your brain you put a headset right we could add some like surgical

152
0:11:04.440 --> 0:11:08.240
instruments to your VR headset and just let you know slot it directly into your

153
0:11:08.240 --> 0:11:11.800
brain with some drills and stuff it's really the only way we'd get everyone

154
0:11:11.800 --> 0:11:16.420
like on that information and hey my my videos terrible on all of the social

155
0:11:16.420 --> 0:11:22.040
videos I'm like disclaimer I might be poo-poo poo-poo pee-peeing this up I

156
0:11:22.040 --> 0:11:25.320
might be like literally being hypocritical and sometimes I am and

157
0:11:25.320 --> 0:11:28.520
that's because we're all not perfect right sometimes I might fail to read

158
0:11:28.520 --> 0:11:32.280
the room sometimes I might but in an accident they take over when someone's

159
0:11:32.280 --> 0:11:36.200
helping someone like we're not perfect and so I keep that disclaimer there

160
0:11:36.200 --> 0:11:39.840
because like hey you want to call me out on something go for it if we learn and

161
0:11:39.840 --> 0:11:42.760
grow together we'll learn and grow together or as if we just like I don't

162
0:11:42.760 --> 0:11:45.720
know get scared about and hide in the corner we'll get scared about it and hide

163
0:11:45.720 --> 0:11:49.560
in the corner Zachary has a question here which is if I built a world and I'm

164
0:11:49.560 --> 0:11:52.240
not sure if I did something an efficient way could I ping you and let you swing

165
0:11:52.240 --> 0:11:56.240
by to take a look I do not have time to do that best bet is to ask in the

166
0:11:56.240 --> 0:11:59.840
discord for a mentor specifically a mentor that is suitable for world

167
0:11:59.840 --> 0:12:05.360
building the efficient in air quotes ways of building a world do spread

168
0:12:05.360 --> 0:12:08.480
around a little bit again like that tribal knowledge we do want to write

169
0:12:08.480 --> 0:12:12.820
them up on the wiki given the current climate wiki editing is is less of a

170
0:12:12.820 --> 0:12:16.520
priority for me right now but we do want to write that up on the wiki

171
0:12:16.520 --> 0:12:19.480
particularly dispelling any myths about stuff which does not improve world

172
0:12:19.480 --> 0:12:24.320
performance such as the video I did on asset the asset the duplication system

173
0:12:24.320 --> 0:12:30.240
and how that is frequently bypassed almost accidentally dorky confirms that

174
0:12:30.240 --> 0:12:34.480
as an Australian who has studied wildlife that they are still confused by

175
0:12:34.480 --> 0:12:38.360
the platypus fantastic thank you for being confused by the panelists also get

176
0:12:38.360 --> 0:12:41.660
confused by the pangolin which I believe is also like a rodent or maybe they're

177
0:12:41.660 --> 0:12:44.200
a mammal I can't remember pangolins are interesting moving towards two

178
0:12:44.200 --> 0:12:48.560
additional questions Ruscio says for the delay or delay with value node when used

179
0:12:48.560 --> 0:12:51.360
with no input can you blame the default behavior it seems like it's performing

180
0:12:51.360 --> 0:12:55.040
some kind of delay based on its ability to prevent some loops going red is it

181
0:12:55.040 --> 0:12:59.280
equivalent to a single update delay you mean the delay one with time I mean I

182
0:12:59.280 --> 0:13:04.120
guess you can just look at both let me take a look delay no this is a base

183
0:13:04.120 --> 0:13:11.080
class interesting delay the dot evaluate cool start with that so start delay

184
0:13:11.080 --> 0:13:17.880
gets a second it looks like it'll do whatever the default value for a float

185
0:13:17.880 --> 0:13:23.240
is but by its nature if you know anything about C sharp you can just go

186
0:13:23.240 --> 0:13:28.760
figure out right it does task dot delay and then whatever the default value for

187
0:13:28.760 --> 0:13:36.240
a float is and so I believe if you do like the equivalent of a weight a weight

188
0:13:36.240 --> 0:13:43.280
task delay zero you still bump execution out of the synchronous you bump it you

189
0:13:43.280 --> 0:13:46.660
still bump it to an asynchronous location even though there is a zero

190
0:13:46.660 --> 0:13:50.380
second delay so that might be the update cycle that you're saying basically it's

191
0:13:50.380 --> 0:13:54.800
like diverting to the next update loop because you basically said hey break

192
0:13:54.800 --> 0:13:59.740
here we're going into async land and then come back literally less than a

193
0:13:59.740 --> 0:14:03.600
second exactly zero seconds after that so yeah even if it was zero you'd get

194
0:14:03.600 --> 0:14:10.360
that basically one update cycle delay I would much rather you use the updates

195
0:14:10.360 --> 0:14:14.480
delay for those who are aware the delay and delay with value nodes take a time

196
0:14:14.480 --> 0:14:18.720
so that's good if you want sort of like cooldowns or a time sequence or

197
0:14:18.720 --> 0:14:23.800
something like that the updates delay node will delay events by a number of

198
0:14:23.800 --> 0:14:27.880
updates which is basically just sort of everything updating in the world that's

199
0:14:27.880 --> 0:14:31.920
sometimes needed you'll frequently come across it with dynamic variables and

200
0:14:31.920 --> 0:14:36.040
reparenting sort of creating dynamic variables dynamic variable spaces you'll

201
0:14:36.040 --> 0:14:42.880
know when you need an update delay node eventually again I'd love to wrap some

202
0:14:42.880 --> 0:14:45.760
guidelines on those but like sometimes I literally just throw them in there

203
0:14:45.760 --> 0:14:48.680
because stuff isn't working like if you've ever like got logics and you're

204
0:14:48.680 --> 0:14:52.520
like I really really think that this should work and it doesn't work and it's

205
0:14:52.520 --> 0:14:56.560
like 5 a.m. and I haven't had any sleep and I need it to work try throwing in

206
0:14:56.560 --> 0:15:02.640
some updating relays try floring in some to update delay nodes two is usually a

207
0:15:02.640 --> 0:15:06.440
good number and see if it works and then slowly start removing those elements

208
0:15:06.440 --> 0:15:09.480
until it you know stops working again and then you'll figure out where you

209
0:15:09.480 --> 0:15:14.040
need those particular items all right I didn't realize that I needed to scroll

210
0:15:14.040 --> 0:15:16.680
down so if I was just sitting there in silence just cuz I didn't realize I

211
0:15:16.680 --> 0:15:20.580
needed to scroll down so give me a second once I catch up just make sure I

212
0:15:20.580 --> 0:15:26.080
haven't delayed any questions here so Zetta says during performance penalty to

213
0:15:26.080 --> 0:15:29.020
the initial load of an avatar for slot strict assets that are marked as

214
0:15:29.020 --> 0:15:32.680
inactive are they loaded and left inactive yes that exactly actually comes

215
0:15:32.680 --> 0:15:36.200
up good way of thinking about that one is the good old sort of like drummed in

216
0:15:36.200 --> 0:15:40.800
via moderation thing about do not have appendages on your avatar right even if

217
0:15:40.800 --> 0:15:46.160
the mesh loader the mesh is right even if the slot is disabled the mesh renderer

218
0:15:46.160 --> 0:15:49.520
is disabled I'm still going to end up with an appendage on my computer in my

219
0:15:49.520 --> 0:15:54.920
cache so don't put appendages on your avatars by default and you load cloud

220
0:15:54.920 --> 0:16:00.300
avatars instead if you need your appendage load into the avatar that has

221
0:16:00.300 --> 0:16:05.400
the appendage or spawn the appendage and attach it to yourself don't keep it

222
0:16:05.400 --> 0:16:10.200
there same thing goes with Zetta's question there which is if you don't

223
0:16:10.200 --> 0:16:14.800
need the object in this case it could be something more innocuous than an

224
0:16:14.800 --> 0:16:20.520
appendage don't have it on the avatar good example being like guns right so I

225
0:16:20.520 --> 0:16:24.280
see a lot of people will have like a holstered gun on their avatar which they

226
0:16:24.280 --> 0:16:29.400
shoot I don't know like once a week you don't need that on your avatar or maybe

227
0:16:29.400 --> 0:16:34.200
you need one that is inactive and doesn't have logic on it if it's part of

228
0:16:34.200 --> 0:16:37.880
the character that you want part of it to be you know it's there then they're

229
0:16:37.880 --> 0:16:42.360
just it's an inactive gun then you'd have less of a cost there because you

230
0:16:42.360 --> 0:16:45.600
won't be loading the logics on the gun and then hey if you need the gun you can

231
0:16:45.600 --> 0:16:51.120
support it in or update it or cloud spawn it or do all sorts of stuff like

232
0:16:51.120 --> 0:16:55.480
that socks I don't respond well to dots you'll please need to enunciate and

233
0:16:55.480 --> 0:17:02.040
elaborate on your your thought Lux asks what kind of world building tools that

234
0:17:02.040 --> 0:17:04.920
don't exist ready do you think people who are more artistically orientated

235
0:17:04.920 --> 0:17:08.160
appreciate to help their creative flow I haven't seen some people get hung up

236
0:17:08.160 --> 0:17:11.000
making stuff because they don't want to bother with delving deep into inspectors

237
0:17:11.000 --> 0:17:14.560
or the gizmos and kind of wonky doing architecturally precise things

238
0:17:14.560 --> 0:17:17.880
architectural tools are certainly something that we need a really good

239
0:17:17.880 --> 0:17:22.480
example being the builder tip by Gehepe which is one of the amazing Japanese

240
0:17:22.480 --> 0:17:26.640
creators that we have that lets you snap together various tile sets to really

241
0:17:26.640 --> 0:17:30.360
really quickly make buildings and objects a little known fact about the

242
0:17:30.360 --> 0:17:33.680
builder tip is that you can make your own sets so let's say that you just got

243
0:17:33.680 --> 0:17:39.400
an amazing I don't know let's say city pack on the sketch fab and you know it's

244
0:17:39.400 --> 0:17:43.600
got snappable stuff like a park and then like a bank or whatever you could load

245
0:17:43.600 --> 0:17:46.960
that into the builder tip like it doesn't have to be walls it doesn't have

246
0:17:46.960 --> 0:17:51.680
to be doors it could be like road pieces for a racetrack it could be stairs it

247
0:17:51.680 --> 0:17:55.900
could be you know it could be fruit that you want to like tessellate for some

248
0:17:55.900 --> 0:18:00.960
reason like it could be hexagons that you want to tessellate on a floor like it

249
0:18:00.960 --> 0:18:05.840
doesn't need to be the default pack you can just add stuff to it

250
0:18:05.840 --> 0:18:09.520
additionally sort of architecturally speaking it's just sort of like more

251
0:18:09.520 --> 0:18:15.400
tools that like feel good to use a good example which I use a lot right now but

252
0:18:15.400 --> 0:18:18.220
not a lot of people realize exist is if you go to essential tools and you look

253
0:18:18.220 --> 0:18:21.340
around there there's the meter tool tip the meter tool tip allows you to measure

254
0:18:21.340 --> 0:18:26.320
stuff in the world and not a lot of people need to measure stuff I do because

255
0:18:26.320 --> 0:18:30.640
I do a lot of science it's important to make things off to scale but once you

256
0:18:30.640 --> 0:18:34.600
start using the meter tip you feel like it feels good right there's no

257
0:18:34.600 --> 0:18:39.820
inspectors to it you're like I want to know how big this appendage is I can

258
0:18:39.820 --> 0:18:44.200
measure it using the meter tip I don't need to get an inspector it was too good

259
0:18:44.200 --> 0:18:51.080
not to carrying on peach says do mirrors have an option to not show other

260
0:18:51.080 --> 0:18:55.560
mirrors reflections if so please do a video I don't believe that is a thing

261
0:18:55.560 --> 0:19:00.080
right now that would be more of a gains question I do believe we have a github

262
0:19:00.080 --> 0:19:05.680
issue open about it where there's talk of mirrors and stuff like that my advice

263
0:19:05.680 --> 0:19:09.860
there is just don't show a mirror to another mirror which I know is like sort

264
0:19:09.860 --> 0:19:15.600
of a cop-out but like it depends on your scenario there was that MMC entry forget

265
0:19:15.600 --> 0:19:20.340
what it was called but it had lots of reflection based mechanics as a puzzle

266
0:19:20.340 --> 0:19:23.960
game so sorry I forgot its name but they must have done some tricks there to

267
0:19:23.960 --> 0:19:26.720
figure that out with that I don't believe we got any additional questions

268
0:19:26.720 --> 0:19:29.520
I'm gonna go ahead and cool things here if you have any additional questions

269
0:19:29.520 --> 0:19:33.360
please drop them in questions and help DM me or anything like that and I will

270
0:19:33.360 --> 0:19:37.800
get back to you as soon as I can thank you for sitting here with me today to

271
0:19:37.800 --> 0:19:50.600
talk about tools and I will see you again next week
