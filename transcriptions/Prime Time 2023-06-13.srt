00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
 Alright, it is 4pm, welcome to Office Hours with Prime.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,880
 I'm here to answer your Neos questions, and you can drop those in the Office Hours text chat.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,920
 Make sure you're talking in the Office Hours text chat and not the text channel that's for this

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,480
 weird thing that we should use, but I think Discord doesn't make it obvious enough that

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,920
 this exists, so many people don't see it, but many people still don't see the thread,

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,520
 so it just gets really really complicated. Anyway, get your questions in the usual place,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,640
 I'll answer them in the order that they appear. Whilst there are no questions,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,280
 we're going to be sitting here in unimaginable silence, just hoping for some juicy question that

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,400
 we can probably do some strange anecdote on. Whilst we wait for a question, did you know that

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,400
 right now in RuneScape, yes that's RuneScape, there is an event where you can get a cape,

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,840
 and once you have the cape it gives you a 30-day buff which will transmit anything that you mine,

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,240
 woodcut, or fish to your bank for free, which means lots of people are training mining and

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,800
 woodcutting very very quickly right now, including me, who has been mining in the same spot for a

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,560
 very long time. It is completely unrelated to NeoSina, but I just thought I'd let you know.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,120
 I have to fill the dead air sometimes because someone's grandmother told me there should be

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,640
 less dead air. Left 4 Dead was a good game, but I think it was like the end of 2022,

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,720
 I instantiated a policy in my brain which is I will never play Left 4 Dead again.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,360
 Basically what happens is I install it, and then someone says a few months later "Let's play Left

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,200
 4 Dead" and then I reinstall it, we play once and then never again, so I've just decided no,

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
 I will never play it again and that way it can be removed from my computer. Same thing happens with

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,640
 Grand Theft Auto V actually. The moment I uninstall Grand Theft Auto V sometimes it's just needed

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,080
 again, and I don't really understand why that keeps happening but there we go. Oh yeah, the

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,760
 dead air was also removed from the crawling because we have an effect in Audacity called

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,800
 Truncate Silence. It's useful for making you only listen to the questions or me manically laughing

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,760
 at you. We still have no questions, so this is going to be a quick office hours unless questions

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,360
 start appearing very soon, but yes, unimaginable silence. DIA says that they need something like

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
 Truncate Silence for their sleep talk recordings. If you get the app Sleep as an Android it will do

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,240
 it for you. If you're not on Android device I can't help you, but there's probably a similar

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,840
 app for an iOS device. I've had Sleep as an Android for many many years. It keeps track of

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,800
 how much sleep you need and how much sleep you're getting in the form of a sleep deficit graph. The

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,400
 deficit graph is un-resetable, so it's just been listing my deficit for months and years, and it's

32
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,480
 just like, you know, you've missed 609,000 hours of sleep or whatever it is. It's wrong because it's

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
 got duplicate data or something from when I change phones, but I can't reset it, so it's just like

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,960
 your deficit is really bad. It's like, okay, cool. All right, so we got a cheese question,

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,800
 which I don't answer, so skipping that one, sorry about that. Lex says are you aware of,

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,520
 are you aware, and if you are, do you have any comments on the issues that a large amount of

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,400
 people are having with Learning Essence in the US? I am aware of them, I am taking a look at them,

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,440
 but I don't have any further comments on their matter. Erin asks, other than the US,

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,440
 what games have you worked on that you enjoyed your time while doing so, if any? I haven't

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,440
 really worked on any other games. Oh yeah, I haven't really worked on any other games.

41
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,840
 A couple of projects here and there, a few bits and pieces, never really like, you know. I am

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:29,840
 partially responsible for a particular piece of literature, which I will dig up.

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,000
 If anyone is seeing people's names in Discord cut off with triple dashes, it is a security feature

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,680
 that is instilled into Discord via the username update debacle. You have streamer mode enabled,

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
 and that is why people's names are cut off like that. There is no documentation on that,

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
 I just figured it out because some random person tweeted it and then some other random person

47
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,280
 retweeted it. It has been bothering me too, but there you go. Yes, I am partially responsible for

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,960
 the fact that there was a video involving pigs on the Xbox YouTube channel. I will

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,520
 paste that tweet when I find it, because I think I have it close to hand. I do. Yes, it's really

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,200
 only for people that have got the username update as far as I'm aware. It's something because like,

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,240
 now that, like, I don't know, it's a feature of streamer mode. I appreciate it because streamer

52
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:28,400
 mode is cool, but like, you know, I could speak forever about streaming security and making sure

53
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,720
 you don't leak your bank details while still streaming. But you know, that's not a Neos

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,600
 question. Any additional Neos questions? Seeing as we just had the pig video from Mixer. I don't know

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
 if there's any other Mixer stuff on the Xbox channel. There probably is. Let me see if I'm

56
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,400
 responsible for any more of it. I'm not responsible for that or that or that. I'm responsible for that

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,000
 one. Who had that one? Oh, they're tips and tricks videos. Got it. Okay. Yeah, cool. I'm not responsible

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,760
 for tips and tricks, but yeah. Anyway, as a reminder, if there are no questions, we're going

59
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,920
 to sit here in silence. Take a moment to, you know, stare out of the window. If you haven't been

60
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,960
 looking at the computer monitor for too long, you should look at something at least 20 feet away

61
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,200
 for 20 seconds every 20 minutes or something like that. 20, 20, 20. Yeah. I'm sure you're breathing

62
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,000
 right as well. So many people don't know how to breathe. Well, I don't mean stupidly, but you know,

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,920
 there are different mechanisms for breathing. You can breathe at the top of your, at the top of your

64
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,000
 chest or like right the way down into the bottom. And you need to do that right the way down into

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,120
 the bottom. Oh my God, we have a question. Do you happen to know why animated meshes seem to jump

66
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,920
 when you swap the animation? I would presume that's because we don't have any smoothing

67
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,720
 between those animations. So let's say animation one has a character's right hand raised and an

68
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,240
 animation two has the character's left hand raised or right hand lowered. Like there's no way to sort

69
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,440
 of smoothly interpolate between those. Oh, comma frames at the end. Honestly, it's probably still

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,440
 interpolating. Our animation system just needs like reworking it. It really annoys me. I have

71
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,000
 actually FPX animations just in general too. I've got a world where, it's a science world, people

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,520
 need to give a speech in front of some pretend judges or business folks. And they were just sort

73
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,600
 of staring at the person that's in that world. And it was, you know, like, oh, could we get them to

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,600
 like, you know, do something? And so we did. And the way that we did that is I had to go to

75
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,320
 Mixima and I took three animations, had to stitch them together inside a blender, which took forever

76
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,600
 because they didn't know how to do it, apply the animation to five people, get it into the game.

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,360
 And then because one of the animations was writing, I had to like write logics to position a pen that

78
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
 appeared in their hands whilst the animation played that they were writing, and they disappeared

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,320
 when they stopped writing. All to make them look more interesting. electronic has another question.

80
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,200
 They say, does the headless play animations or can it not? Should be able to. Animations are just

81
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,720
 like streams of data, right? It won't render them because it doesn't render them. But it's,

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,880
 it's still do the updates. I don't know if they run locally, they might run locally.

83
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:21,040
 As much as I hate the fact that in VRChat you have to do everything with animation trees,

84
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,200
 we need all that feature from Unity, like animation trees, animation state machines,

85
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,160
 all sorts of stuff like that. VRChat users should not have to do that. I was looking at making

86
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,440
 the face tracker work over in VRChat, and it was just like, what the f-- it's just so complicated.

87
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,480
 All I want to do is make some blend shapes change. Why am I making 50 animations and linking them

88
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:48,000
 together with spaghetti? But there you go. I got like 30 seconds into the process of making it work

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,320
 on my avatar over there, and I just said, nah, I'd rather just grab a cheese grater or shredder,

90
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,880
 push it right against my face, but that'd be a lot easier. There are like community tools to make

91
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,920
 that stuff easier, but a couple of them are archived, and I followed like three archive links

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,560
 until I got very confused and just decided, meh, not today. We're just over halfway through this,

93
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,920
 so if you have any more additional Neos questions, please do let me know. Please drop them into the

94
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,680
 uh text thread, I'm not seeing any here, just uh, whilst that's not there, just remember to breathe,

95
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,160
 stare at something into the distance, and there you go. Uh, Erin asks, actually that is a question,

96
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,040
 but it's not a Neos question, but seeing as there's dead air, we'll fill it, um,

97
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,800
 they say, uh, does losing focus and staring at nothing count as zonar tot when? Yes, that does,

98
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,960
 that may be a sign of some, um, mental trouble, so do keep an eye out. Sometimes I enjoy just

99
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,160
 staring at a wall, I'm not really staring at the wall, I guess I'm just like, you know, not using

100
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,640
 my eyes for the moment. Oh yeah, because there are any useful, uh, components you found in Neos

101
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,280
 recently, and I found texture size driver personally, it saved me a lot of trouble. Um,

102
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,720
 there haven't been, um, there hasn't been a case of that like in a long time, like sometimes you

103
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,600
 just find a component and you're just like, that's, you know, exactly what I needed it for.

104
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,960
 There are some times where you, like, you find a component and you're like, okay, I understand what

105
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,440
 that does, I just don't understand why it does it, but then you like see it later and you're just

106
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,840
 like, all right, that's cool. But yeah, neither of those have happened in a while. Um, like I'm sure

107
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,600
 there are ones out there, it just depends, like at some point you've used all the components that

108
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,120
 you're going to use, there's like edge cases. Uh, Aaron asks, are there any questions you would ask

109
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,920
 right now in office hours if someone else was in your place? Um, I am getting like interesting

110
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,200
 questions where someone's building something that isn't obviously an oldie tool or an inspector,

111
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,600
 that's what I like. Um, moving forwards to, uh, Churnace's question. Um, see here's an example,

112
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,520
 light cookies, lighting, excellent. Lighting is a fantastic topic and more people should do it. By

113
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,320
 the way, it is not natural if you have an indoor only map that you have a sun, please turn off your

114
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,880
 sun and light it with lights. Um, and there should be dark corners of your indoor space, there should

115
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,680
 be bright corners of your indoor space. Like think about like a bar, right? The bar should have lights

116
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,440
 above it, so you can walk up to it and have a drink, but maybe like a booth in the corner of

117
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,160
 the bar should have a darker light to it. You can't do that if you've got a sun inside your box,

118
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,880
 turn off the sun if you're doing an indoor only map. Um, so electronic is asking, uh,

119
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,080
 something issues of light cookie not being loaded when I needed it, is there a good way to ensure

120
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,480
 it's loaded? Try the asset loader, I think it's called, it's in the assets folder. It will ensure

121
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,080
 an asset is loaded before you need it. Uh, you need to sort of put things in that component if

122
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,560
 you are using them from outside asset components. So things like the asset multiplexer or

123
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,720
 stuff like that will try and keep the asset loaded. But if you have an asset as a raw reference,

124
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,640
 it might de-load, so try the asset loader. Saray asks, um, would it make sense to have a

125
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,760
 gesture system in the assistantials that are relatively easy to instill, given that when you

126
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,240
 without, uh, Logix expressions tend to be intimidated because it looks, yes. Uh, there are

127
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,240
 multiple gesture systems inside an assistantials and that is actually one of the problems that we

128
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,040
 have. Um, I am working with the team on that one when I can, um, but we need to sort of standardize

129
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,920
 a little bit more rigidly what we put in that folder to make sure that it is, it's very good.

130
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,800
 Um, every single MMC, for example, we get a new gesture system and I am, I'm not bothered by the

131
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,680
 fact that we do, um, in terms of the user making it, I'm bothered by the fact that Neos itself

132
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,520
 hasn't solved that. Like I don't, I don't understand why there are so many. I mean,

133
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,920
 I do, but like, I don't understand why we haven't made that not in a necessity, right.

134
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,000
 You always be able to use your own systems, of course, but why don't we just have our own?

135
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,400
 And if we're like, oh yeah, but we, you know, we don't really like gesture based systems. I don't

136
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,880
 like gesture based systems. We can still make one. It's easy. Um, so we should do that. We should

137
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,240
 definitely do that instead of making our own. Like if we made our own Logix based one, there would

138
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,960
 just be another Logix based one, right? I made one of the first ones, which was the gesture wheel

139
00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:00,800
 based one. Um, it got sort of outdated within like a week. So that's fine. But like, even when I made

140
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,960
 that, I felt bad because I felt like I was contributing to the problem, which is there are

141
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,440
 too many gesture systems and none of them are easy to use. If we made one that was like Neo standard,

142
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,480
 it would probably be like a very simple component. Um, I'd like to, you know, maybe build like a

143
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,160
 wizardy UI for it. Uh, and that way, um, we would of course be adding another standard,

144
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,480
 the list of standards people are referencing, uh, an XKCD comic, but it would allow us to

145
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,560
 help in that because most people wouldn't even have to get the Logix tip out.

146
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,040
 Like one of the big problems I see when people come into Neos is they're almost like goaded,

147
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,560
 either accidentally or sometimes on purpose, please don't do this by the way, um, into

148
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,760
 getting a Logix tip or a developer tip out, right? Cause they need to set up their avatar

149
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,000
 or someone starts talking to them at multi-tools or inspectors and stuff like that. It's like,

150
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,040
 just, just let them experience Neos as a new user, uh, don't force technical stuff into them.

151
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,400
 But to do that, we need a better avatar setup that isn't as technical as its current avatar setup.

152
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,640
 So moving onwards to electronicist question says, uh, is there a good tutorial for NMJ?

153
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,560
 Uh, there's like the Wiki page, like got some information on it. There's also some research

154
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,160
 that Lex did. Um, we could never really find, like we kept coming across bugs, so we kind of just

155
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,360
 stopped. So no, there's no tutorial I'm aware of, but the Wiki does have some information that,

156
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,880
 okay, the Wiki didn't help. And sorry about that, but you know, we try.

157
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,640
 Maybe, yeah, and you're stifles talking about the, the various bugs that exist in, um, NMJ. Yeah,

158
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,560
 there's, there's bugs, there's problems. We've got a question in two parts, which looks like I'm

159
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,600
 answering the long, I'm out of order, but I'm not. Um, uh, Jack will ask when you do tutorials

160
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,120
 again, which consider one that does a review of less obvious data types. And then in a follow-up

161
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,320
 message, they say like iWorld element or SyncRef backtick one, uh, you shouldn't be using iWorld

162
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,640
 element. If you are using it, you're probably doing something incorrectly. If you're using

163
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,480
 SyncRef, you are at the point in using Neos where you should not require a tutorial on it.

164
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,240
 Um, both of those things are very, very advanced. And if you're using them, uh, you really need to

165
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,560
 know how like C# works. Like always, always, always start with a problem, right? So if you're using

166
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,840
 iWorld element, you're probably implementing the solution to a problem incorrectly, or your problem

167
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,800
 is really advanced and there's no other way to do it, but mess around with that stuff. But I don't

168
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,080
 advise messing around with that stuff. And therefore I won't be tutorialing it because

169
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 it is, it's structured so vague compared to like the problem. Trying to think of a good analogy

170
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,600
 and the only one that came into my head, and it probably is not a good analogy, but the only one

171
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:44,960
 that came into my head is it's like someone asking how to tie their shoelace by going to a, uh, rope

172
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,520
 manufacturer. It's like, alright, let's go watch a rope being made. Like, let's start with the problem.

173
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,160
 Like what, what, what do you want to do with those, those things? Uh, Jackyl, again, we're jumping

174
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,240
 around. Cody, I'll get to you in just a second. Um, Jackyl updates with, so don't mess with reference

175
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,360
 target, the logics note. No, you can use that. You can use everything. It's just like, you need to know

176
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,840
 why you're using it. Like I use that note a lot, but I need a problem that requires it's use to

177
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,360
 explain it. I can't, like, I can tell you what it does and that's exactly what it does, but let's

178
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,840
 start with the problem, not the data type. Um, if you really, really want to see why that's the, the

179
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,920
 stance I take, go take a look at the C# reference, which is the language of course that Neos has

180
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,520
 written in. There are like data types in there that I have like no idea why anyone would go

181
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:36,720
 anywhere near them. It's just like, cool. Um, I actually had an interesting issue the other day,

182
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,720
 uh, with, it was something like, you know, a trip, like anyone who knows, um, uh, C# knows that you

183
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,640
 can put attributes above stuff, right? So you put like square races and then some other stuff, and

184
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,920
 it's sort of like tags a piece of code and says, do this extra piece of functionality. There are

185
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,400
 tributes in C# that have no documentation, but it sounds really cool. And you just don't know how to

186
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,640
 like, just like, Microsoft, come on, tell me what they do. And it's just like, nope, not going to

187
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,000
 tell you what they do. Uh, let me take a look. Um, I'm going to jump back to questions. Play code.

188
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,520
 It says what are the best method for requesting tutorial recording a 3d moment that has a component

189
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,400
 I'm not familiar with. Um, you should list that 3d model and component in your question. That'd

190
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,480
 be great stuff. Um, Maya has a patreon question, please direct message shifty about those. Um,

191
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,320
 I don't handle them here. Um, uh, Play code. He says they saw your wire cube object and saw

192
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,480
 the component that drives the mesh of the wires. Ah, that's the wire stuff. I don't know how that

193
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,800
 works. Um, I have no idea. Like, um, that creates a piece of wire between two points, but it does it

194
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,080
 in a way to kind of try to, and it does it really badly, but tries to avoid twisting and tries to

195
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,600
 make it look like a patch cable might on, like an analog synthesizer or a breadboard electrical

196
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,920
 circuit. I'm trying to suggest using a making a tutorial for ref hacking. You can absolutely

197
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,720
 do that. I won't personally be doing that because I don't think that we should. Um, I don't think

198
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,400
 you should be doing it. You can do it and there's nothing wrong with doing it. No one's going to yell

199
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,800
 at you for doing it, but just know that you're, you know, you're doing stuff I'm telling you not

200
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,200
 to. That one's a bit like, um, trying to think of another analogy here that might work. You peek

201
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,000
 behind the curtain on your ref hack, basically. So you're peeking behind the curtain and you know,

202
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,600
 you get certain capabilities with that, but like the curtain's always changing.

203
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 Last question, because we're running low on time here, um, from Storm who says, uh,

204
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,840
 any idea what was causing the issues of worlds and items not sinking over the weekend? I don't know.

205
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,960
 I have a team are aware of it. Um, people that can are looking into it. I don't know. With that,

206
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
 I think we've got all the questions. If you have any additional questions, please drop them into

207
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,720
 the questions and up channel where someone will help you out or direct message me. I will see you

208
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,160
 again next week. Um, the six, the 6th of June is now up on the Wiki. I know Lex, I have a bunch of

209
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,880
 SRT files. I'll get those shortly. I'll get this recording done and up as soon as I can. I am

210
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,600
 moving right now. What's it does anyone know when like tape doesn't work? I have a roll of duct tape

211
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,960
 and like I taped up a box and then I go to it this morning and the box is undone. And I'm just like,

212
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,400
 is this just bad tape? What the hell? It could be humidity killed it. I don't know. I've got some

213
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
 new tape arriving, but that means I need to like remove the old tape and apply the new tape. It's

214
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,440
 just really annoying. Specs says duct tape isn't good for packing boxes. I do have like box, like

215
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,560
 specific box tape coming in the mail. I'm getting movers, but like there's, I have a box. I have a

216
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:37,920
 bookshelf. Uh, books in a box shelf. Uh, yeah. Anyway, I will leave off there. Bye-bye.
