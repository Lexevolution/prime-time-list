0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.420
Welcome to office hours with prime. This is prime time your chance to ask questions about

2
0:00:06.120 --> 0:00:11.460
Pretty much anything you want about Nia, so please feel free to drop in those questions two channels up from one

3
0:00:11.460 --> 0:00:16.320
You currently clicked on which is the office hours text chat. I don't see any questions there so until there are questions there

4
0:00:16.320 --> 0:00:18.320
We're just going to sit in awkward silence

5
0:00:18.720 --> 0:00:25.820
If you want a question answered drop it in there otherwise awkward silence will get more and more awkward the longer you let it fester

6
0:00:25.820 --> 0:00:33.100
If I asks, what did I miss the answer is nothing we've had absolutely nothing so far so again awkward silence

7
0:00:33.340 --> 0:00:34.700
but with

8
0:00:34.700 --> 0:00:41.180
Slightly more awkwardness ah we have a question from shadow coffee shadow coffee says where do you see Nia's being in three to five years?

9
0:00:41.780 --> 0:00:48.040
Um it's a little bit difficult right now to you to the announcers channel, so I don't really know I'd like to see that turned around

10
0:00:48.540 --> 0:00:52.980
And once that's turned around I'm sure we'll have plans and ideas until it's turned around

11
0:00:52.980 --> 0:00:56.180
I don't really know okay, so the next question is from NFT hater

12
0:00:56.540 --> 0:01:01.600
NFT hater says is it possible to browse the web within near so I'd like to access documentation in game

13
0:01:02.100 --> 0:01:04.760
My best advice there would to be use the desktop

14
0:01:05.340 --> 0:01:10.160
The desktop tab of your dash that gives you for access to your regular computer

15
0:01:10.160 --> 0:01:12.460
You can access your browser and all sorts of stuff from there

16
0:01:12.460 --> 0:01:17.220
That's the best option right now in the future would likely have inbuilt documentation tools of in the game

17
0:01:17.220 --> 0:01:19.220
That means that you don't really need a browser to do so

18
0:01:19.860 --> 0:01:21.860
and then beyond that we'll have

19
0:01:21.860 --> 0:01:29.860
a better more accurate screen sharing that's a feature on our roadmap to allow you to look at like you know individual applications or

20
0:01:30.580 --> 0:01:34.040
Services etc so you don't have to do the whole desktop tab, but the desktop tab is great

21
0:01:34.040 --> 0:01:40.260
I don't understand why more people don't use it for like basically everything. It's like having a computer inside

22
0:01:40.260 --> 0:01:44.820
Yes, your host is prime. Can you make a vid on you trying cheeses and rating them someday?

23
0:01:44.820 --> 0:01:51.540
Um I need to do some research and maybe speak to some other youtubers about it because like I never really understood

24
0:01:51.540 --> 0:01:55.700
Why youtube has made second channels, but like I now have a second channel where I put like junk

25
0:01:55.700 --> 0:01:59.660
But like I'd love if my channel could be like other stuff

26
0:01:59.980 --> 0:02:03.740
But if I start putting non-neo's video tutorials there

27
0:02:03.740 --> 0:02:08.300
Then I start splitting the universe and splitting the the audience and so I don't really know how that works

28
0:02:08.860 --> 0:02:12.660
I would love if like playlists were more sort of

29
0:02:13.820 --> 0:02:21.160
Fine-grained at YouTube maybe you could subscribe to just a playlist or a topic that a user or creator puts out and that way

30
0:02:21.160 --> 0:02:25.180
You wouldn't get any surprises almost like each channel had like a sub channel

31
0:02:25.180 --> 0:02:31.140
That'd be great because right now my choices appear to be like rename my main channel to be probably prime

32
0:02:31.540 --> 0:02:39.220
Neos make probably prime just general leave the second channel is as probably I'm gaming and then

33
0:02:39.580 --> 0:02:41.340
I mean it has tags

34
0:02:41.340 --> 0:02:44.060
It's just it's like categorization such that you know

35
0:02:44.060 --> 0:02:49.180
I don't have to make like five different channels like you get to the point where it's crazy like you look some really big creators

36
0:02:49.180 --> 0:02:54.820
They've got like six or seven channels just because they want to make different topics and maintain the ability to review them all a little

37
0:02:54.820 --> 0:02:56.460
bit easier

38
0:02:56.460 --> 0:02:58.460
It's it's yeah

39
0:02:58.460 --> 0:03:04.680
Yeah, I just do it like it's gonna start alienating people and it's it's weird. You know, but whatever next question

40
0:03:06.220 --> 0:03:10.740
Shadow coffee says it's Neos based in unity on real or another engine its own. So there's a little bit like

41
0:03:11.460 --> 0:03:17.220
Confusion there that needs to be resolved every time it comes up, which is we currently do use unity

42
0:03:17.220 --> 0:03:20.180
But we only use unity is basically like rendering. That's it

43
0:03:21.060 --> 0:03:23.060
all of the sort of logic and

44
0:03:23.740 --> 0:03:27.760
Operational stuff networking etc is ran via an engine called fruits engine

45
0:03:27.760 --> 0:03:31.940
Which is sort of attached to unity like some sort of weird parasite really

46
0:03:31.940 --> 0:03:35.960
We just feed it like there is a cube over here and unity goes

47
0:03:36.020 --> 0:03:40.300
Okay, and then your computer renders a cube over there. Like that's all that unity is doing

48
0:03:40.300 --> 0:03:44.020
It doesn't do any of the gameplay logic. It's really like it's bare-bones

49
0:03:44.020 --> 0:03:50.300
We want to pull that out and make our own engine to run stuff because that gets us a lot more sort of affordances there

50
0:03:50.640 --> 0:03:54.480
But until that's done, yes, you see another question here from chroma

51
0:03:54.480 --> 0:04:01.480
She says with your absolute expect certain expert certainty that will hold you specifically accountable for where you see Neos

52
0:04:01.480 --> 0:04:03.560
100 years big update marketplace question mark

53
0:04:03.560 --> 0:04:09.660
Um, I don't particularly see any Neos existing in a hundred years and people get like surprised about this

54
0:04:09.760 --> 0:04:12.520
But you have to think about like how long a hundred years is

55
0:04:12.520 --> 0:04:16.800
Is we'll probably be playing something like Neos

56
0:04:16.800 --> 0:04:22.320
I doubt it will be Neos itself as you see it now or as you see it in five years or whatever

57
0:04:23.000 --> 0:04:26.560
There may be you know an equivalent but it certainly

58
0:04:26.880 --> 0:04:34.360
You know won't be the same software package the same engine the same programming language the same input environment

59
0:04:35.640 --> 0:04:36.240
You know

60
0:04:36.240 --> 0:04:42.320
There are people right now that still use the temp five ones and it's just like you expect to be using a vive one

61
0:04:42.320 --> 0:04:47.480
You know hundred years. Nope. What will be our interaction look like then? Like, how will it run?

62
0:04:47.880 --> 0:04:53.320
You talk about paradigms all the time and it's sort of just looking at it like, you know, Nokia 3310

63
0:04:53.360 --> 0:04:58.880
All right, they weren't that long ago. So you just got to think about it. You also have to think about like in a hundred years

64
0:04:58.880 --> 0:05:00.880
like

65
0:05:02.000 --> 0:05:08.020
Stereotypically everyone here will be like not dead but like a little bit dead, right?

66
0:05:08.020 --> 0:05:13.000
Most of us will probably be either dead or not that interested in computer games

67
0:05:13.040 --> 0:05:18.880
Actually, this generation is probably one of the first generations that will be like I still understand our computer works

68
0:05:18.880 --> 0:05:24.200
And I'm 80 because like all of like, you know grandparents stuff like that. They're just like, oh, it's too complicated understand it

69
0:05:24.200 --> 0:05:27.620
I am never going to be that person like as I grow older

70
0:05:27.620 --> 0:05:30.840
I'm gonna be like, okay, even if it takes me like a like a year

71
0:05:30.840 --> 0:05:37.320
I'm gonna like understand, you know the next generations of computers so that I don't turn into that like, you know

72
0:05:37.320 --> 0:05:41.640
Oh, I don't know how to push a button on a computer. Like I'm not I'm not, you know

73
0:05:42.040 --> 0:05:46.640
No one's gonna have to tell like grandpa prime how to turn on the television. It's it's not gonna happen

74
0:05:46.880 --> 0:05:51.080
The point there being is like hey, what what are we gonna like? What are we gonna do?

75
0:05:51.080 --> 0:05:58.600
I don't think it's gonna be strapping screens to our face and you know holding weirdly shaped controllers. It's gonna be something else

76
0:05:58.600 --> 0:06:03.440
I don't know what though. I mean, maybe the FTE controller will have been released by then

77
0:06:03.440 --> 0:06:08.560
They keep pushing back their schedule, but whatever so just following up

78
0:06:08.560 --> 0:06:13.620
I think we answered shadows question about will be live in a hundred years. I don't think so something like us maybe

79
0:06:14.240 --> 0:06:21.720
Similar parts of the community but like it's really a long time. Like I almost certainly be dead. So I don't really care

80
0:06:23.600 --> 0:06:28.240
Will we be up up there we'll be able to upload our consciousness into nears. No, not nears

81
0:06:28.240 --> 0:06:31.220
I wouldn't trust us with our consciousness. Um, it'd probably crash

82
0:06:31.220 --> 0:06:36.100
Oh, yeah, you gotta be like reasonable and you got to be like realistic, right?

83
0:06:36.240 --> 0:06:41.700
the the whole consciousness thing is is terrifying go play soma soma is a very good game that

84
0:06:42.140 --> 0:06:46.900
Endeavors to teach you about the sort of horror that is consciousness transference

85
0:06:47.140 --> 0:06:52.860
but I've seen a lot of people who play soma and they're just like yeah your spooky horror game like amnesia and I'm like

86
0:06:53.040 --> 0:06:55.860
You're missing like the actual horror. Yes, of course

87
0:06:55.860 --> 0:07:02.620
there are monsters etc, but look into like who the monsters are why they exist and then look into like who you are and you'll

88
0:07:02.620 --> 0:07:07.980
You'll figure it out and you'll see the real horror is just like existing in that game. Like you can stand

89
0:07:08.580 --> 0:07:14.260
Directly in the first tutorial room of soma and it's terrifying if you know exactly what's going on

90
0:07:14.340 --> 0:07:16.820
You don't even need to take a step just stand there

91
0:07:17.060 --> 0:07:21.420
Although screw the patterns in spartan summer and I'm not like spoiling any part of summer at all here

92
0:07:21.420 --> 0:07:23.980
But at one point you are very very far down

93
0:07:23.980 --> 0:07:25.980
underwater and

94
0:07:26.260 --> 0:07:29.500
You have to go out in a very high-pressure suit and there are like

95
0:07:29.900 --> 0:07:33.580
tunnels like caves and tunnels and stuff and there are like these

96
0:07:33.700 --> 0:07:39.780
Spider crab water creatures that are like attached to the cave walls and they're like thousands of them and it's it's horrible

97
0:07:39.900 --> 0:07:46.820
Like atmospheric storytelling in that like super super underwater area with those like spider crab things on the wall terrible

98
0:07:46.860 --> 0:07:48.620
No spider crabs, please

99
0:07:48.620 --> 0:07:52.380
Speck says considering how much the term metaverse has been somewhat poisoned

100
0:07:52.380 --> 0:07:57.660
Are there any other terms you might personally favor for a virtual world instead? I'm fond of cyberspace myself

101
0:07:57.700 --> 0:08:01.220
I'm fond of no terminology. What I what I don't like is

102
0:08:02.380 --> 0:08:07.900
The words that are used in the media are sort of shortcuts for our headspace, you know, we say social media

103
0:08:08.100 --> 0:08:15.380
You think Twitter Facebook YouTube tik-tok now, but those platforms are all different in their own respects, right?

104
0:08:15.380 --> 0:08:21.300
They're just shortcuts. And so I really rather we used more words to figure out what the thing is because like people call

105
0:08:21.300 --> 0:08:27.320
Everything a metaverse now. I've seen Microsoft Teams been referred to as a metaverse and as someone who works sort of

106
0:08:28.140 --> 0:08:33.340
Horizontally near Microsoft Teams. It's not a metaverse. I hate teams. I just can't stand it. Um

107
0:08:34.100 --> 0:08:35.700
So it's not a metaverse

108
0:08:35.700 --> 0:08:39.980
I mean then some people say like oh metaverse is about interoperability and I think that's cool

109
0:08:39.980 --> 0:08:45.060
So I was looking at a VR game company the other day and they make some good games

110
0:08:45.060 --> 0:08:48.820
The problem is those games are linear in their purpose

111
0:08:48.820 --> 0:08:52.820
So they make a darts game a bowling game and it's like, okay

112
0:08:52.820 --> 0:08:54.940
Well, if I want to play darts, I have to switch to this app

113
0:08:54.940 --> 0:08:56.940
If I don't play bowling I have to switch to this app

114
0:08:57.060 --> 0:09:01.500
But they do have internet operability is in that use it uses the same account system

115
0:09:01.820 --> 0:09:04.560
But like a metaverse would have none of those walls

116
0:09:04.780 --> 0:09:08.580
But it's very difficult to do that with the many cut money companies that are doing it

117
0:09:08.740 --> 0:09:15.340
So I don't like the term. I think it's stupid and I don't think it should be used and I think you should use better

118
0:09:15.340 --> 0:09:21.700
Terminology for it moving on to the next question, which I believe is from my cat. Oh, this is

119
0:09:22.420 --> 0:09:25.340
What kind of options do we have for importing animations into news?

120
0:09:25.380 --> 0:09:29.620
And if not, well that they'll consume with VR chat formatted animations be supported right out of the box

121
0:09:29.620 --> 0:09:34.980
No, so VR animations are stored in unity animation files. We don't support those. We're not unity

122
0:09:34.980 --> 0:09:38.380
I know I said earlier we run on unity, but remember we're this weird sort of like

123
0:09:39.160 --> 0:09:44.540
Parasitical thing that like attaches to unity. We have no idea how unity works at all

124
0:09:44.540 --> 0:09:46.540
We cannot use unity animations

125
0:09:47.180 --> 0:09:49.020
if you want to make an

126
0:09:49.020 --> 0:09:53.980
Like a regular FBX GLTF animation in blender or whatever those will work

127
0:09:54.020 --> 0:09:57.020
There is limited functionality of those you can get away with a lot

128
0:09:57.020 --> 0:10:00.660
Like you'll see a lot of people use them as a few examples in my public folder

129
0:10:00.660 --> 0:10:02.820
But we certainly do need to do more work there

130
0:10:03.100 --> 0:10:09.340
the important thing I would like to stress though is I really want you to think about why you're asking them because some people are

131
0:10:09.340 --> 0:10:14.660
Like I need animations to turn on and off my hat and I'm like we have an inventory system

132
0:10:14.820 --> 0:10:21.460
Just spawn your hat and put it on you don't need an animation for that and then people say I need an animation such

133
0:10:21.460 --> 0:10:24.340
That like when I do the finger gun gesture

134
0:10:24.340 --> 0:10:29.780
I I put a cute face and I'm just like who invented that system and why is that the case?

135
0:10:29.780 --> 0:10:33.100
You don't need an animation for that. You need logics for that

136
0:10:33.540 --> 0:10:37.920
You know, I've seen people say like ah, I need an animation to make my rainbow shader work

137
0:10:37.920 --> 0:10:40.980
I'm like a pano 1d over a

138
0:10:41.940 --> 0:10:44.280
Material like you don't need an animation for that

139
0:10:44.280 --> 0:10:49.780
So really like ask more questions about what you're trying to do and then maybe you don't even need animations

140
0:10:49.980 --> 0:10:53.540
Like hey, I want to do this cool. You don't need animations for that. Hey, I want to do cool

141
0:10:53.540 --> 0:10:58.340
You don't need animations for that. I've heard some people say like hey, I want animations so I can change the walk cycle

142
0:10:58.340 --> 0:11:03.260
Did you know the walk cycle in years is entirely procedural you can control everything about it

143
0:11:03.260 --> 0:11:06.740
If you know specifically which five boxes to check around and take a look at

144
0:11:06.740 --> 0:11:09.020
You're looking for gates. They're inside

145
0:11:09.020 --> 0:11:14.940
I don't know either the rik avatar or ike avatar those components always confuse me like which one's which

146
0:11:15.580 --> 0:11:17.860
and you can do all sorts of things there like I

147
0:11:18.380 --> 0:11:23.380
Played with it a little bit and I managed to get a walk cycle, which is basically just sort of giant leaps

148
0:11:24.260 --> 0:11:26.460
You know like jumping from spot to spot

149
0:11:26.460 --> 0:11:32.540
I also did one where my legs stretched awkwardly forwards like a sort of ballerina doing a prancy sort of leap

150
0:11:32.540 --> 0:11:39.940
But for every step I did another one where my both legs were completely synchronized and just moved up and down like a pogo stick

151
0:11:40.140 --> 0:11:43.720
You can do whatever you want there. No one's just taking the time to sort of

152
0:11:44.240 --> 0:11:48.760
Write documentation my bad or play around with it in another level to sort of tell people about it

153
0:11:48.760 --> 0:11:55.320
But go ahead take a look at gates. They are exceptionally cool, but people just go no one animations, and I'm like okay

154
0:11:55.320 --> 0:11:57.740
Go play the gate system, and then they say no and then we go into the loop

155
0:11:57.740 --> 0:12:03.100
So just ask more questions shadow coffee asks. What's future support can we look forward to in this?

156
0:12:04.260 --> 0:12:07.620
They're asking particularly about hardware, so the interesting thing about hardware is

157
0:12:09.060 --> 0:12:14.260
Fruits and the team would always want to implement hardware, but we have issues sort of communicating the

158
0:12:14.940 --> 0:12:17.240
Priority and the sort of chance of us doing that

159
0:12:17.860 --> 0:12:20.980
So we have a lot of products that are basically like you can implement us

160
0:12:20.980 --> 0:12:24.980
Here's an SDK, and I don't want that like I want the actual device. I want to check it works and

161
0:12:24.980 --> 0:12:28.040
Then they're like oh, that's cost us money to send it to you

162
0:12:28.040 --> 0:12:32.460
So you can loan it to us like we got loaned the the fight the very facial tracker

163
0:12:32.460 --> 0:12:35.060
It was on loan to us. We didn't own it fruits

164
0:12:35.060 --> 0:12:39.180
Just got like it loaned to him he implemented the entire thing and then sent it back

165
0:12:39.180 --> 0:12:41.340
And then he bought one when they actually came out like that

166
0:12:41.340 --> 0:12:43.220
That's like how it worked and it was cool

167
0:12:43.220 --> 0:12:48.740
But then that leads to the next problem, which is I have sent you this hardware, and you haven't implemented it

168
0:12:48.740 --> 0:12:50.740
Why and it's like well just imagine like?

169
0:12:50.740 --> 0:12:56.460
Fruits is mailroom just imagine. It's like a physical place rather than just I know somewhere in his house like fruits

170
0:12:56.460 --> 0:13:00.660
It's mailroom, and it's full of like a hundred devices all stacked up in their boxes

171
0:13:00.660 --> 0:13:03.540
And he wakes up one day, and he's like what do I want to do today?

172
0:13:03.540 --> 0:13:08.500
Do I like grab a device off like the mailroom or do I want to work on something else?

173
0:13:08.500 --> 0:13:11.460
And that's the way it works, so you need to basically be patient

174
0:13:12.020 --> 0:13:15.340
Open a a gab issue for any device you'd like to be

175
0:13:15.500 --> 0:13:20.540
Invented implemented and then get people to vote on it another thing we have there is a problem of adoption

176
0:13:20.540 --> 0:13:24.020
So adoption of some devices is going to be quite low, so

177
0:13:24.940 --> 0:13:28.100
We see adoption of the the haptic vests

178
0:13:28.100 --> 0:13:28.780
They're cool

179
0:13:28.780 --> 0:13:33.700
But I don't know about the adoption of them like I don't even have a percentage of them when it comes to smell and taste support

180
0:13:33.700 --> 0:13:37.900
I see adoption of those being very low right now because of some of the limitations about them

181
0:13:38.660 --> 0:13:45.860
The current really cool smell thing which Peter thinker works on with the company that they work for is great

182
0:13:45.860 --> 0:13:52.540
But it requires a foresight what I mean by that is if you need I don't know a grassy meadow smell

183
0:13:52.580 --> 0:13:57.460
You need to put that scent cartridge into the device which means you can't have spontaneity

184
0:13:57.460 --> 0:14:01.500
so say the next MMC I do smell support and I have a

185
0:14:01.740 --> 0:14:07.220
Cheese factory that you go through unless I pre-worn by I don't know sending a piece of paper to them and say hey

186
0:14:08.540 --> 0:14:12.020
All of the cartridge slots need to be full of cheese one through five

187
0:14:12.020 --> 0:14:16.580
Please make sure you do this before you go in like I've lost the spontaneity. I've lost the surprise

188
0:14:18.180 --> 0:14:24.200
People talk a lot about molecular printing which is like a step beyond 3d printing which is where you print molecules like you're you know

189
0:14:24.200 --> 0:14:26.200
You're printing the individual atoms

190
0:14:26.380 --> 0:14:31.420
Maybe that's a way to go if you'd like to see what that might look like in the future go watch big hero 6 again

191
0:14:31.420 --> 0:14:33.420
the girl with the

192
0:14:34.140 --> 0:14:39.020
Handbag, I guess you could call it. That's a molecular printer, and she can create like all sorts of stuff

193
0:14:39.020 --> 0:14:41.020
She uses throughout that film. It's super cool

194
0:14:41.020 --> 0:14:44.700
That's where you would need to go for like spontaneity to exist in those

195
0:14:44.740 --> 0:14:49.300
The same with taste because it's just like a chemical signal if full-dive VR occurs

196
0:14:49.300 --> 0:14:52.080
You know hooking your brain up, please don't do that by the way look at soma

197
0:14:52.120 --> 0:14:58.080
Then they won't need that of course because they're not recreating the taste using an actual fluid or the smell using natural fluid

198
0:14:58.080 --> 0:15:00.060
They're just like sending false signals to the brain

199
0:15:00.060 --> 0:15:04.820
Hey, you're eating strawberries even though no strawberries actually exist moving on to another question

200
0:15:04.820 --> 0:15:08.060
You know how long will Neos last until it falls out of interesting?

201
0:15:08.060 --> 0:15:12.340
I don't know like I said a hundred years. I can guarantee we'll be playing something different

202
0:15:12.340 --> 0:15:17.060
It might still be made by freaks. Yes, although freaks. Yes will probably be dead in a hundred years

203
0:15:17.060 --> 0:15:19.060
Let's just be honest like you know

204
0:15:19.740 --> 0:15:26.020
No one's living that long right now, and maybe we are again see some of those for how terrifying that might be um

205
0:15:26.620 --> 0:15:31.740
So it's probably gonna be something different who knows I don't know moving on was NFT

206
0:15:31.740 --> 0:15:35.180
Hey, there's a question which says how easy is it to import source engine content?

207
0:15:35.180 --> 0:15:39.100
I'm not sure I haven't seen anyone that does that um usually what happened those you would take

208
0:15:39.420 --> 0:15:45.180
The if it's a map you take it out of hammer editor and export it as like a common model format

209
0:15:45.180 --> 0:15:47.580
I know you can do that from source engine so export it to obj

210
0:15:47.820 --> 0:15:53.980
FBX or whatever and then you can import it easily if you mean an animation or an avatar or anything like that probably a lot

211
0:15:53.980 --> 0:16:01.820
More more difficulty what happens with main like many triple-a 3d engines is they do everything their way because they're an engine

212
0:16:01.820 --> 0:16:08.640
For example the use of blend shapes in most triple-a systems isn't that common they use bones more

213
0:16:08.640 --> 0:16:11.400
It's all about bones bones everywhere so many bones

214
0:16:13.280 --> 0:16:18.480
So that's why when you see facial animations increase there, there's loads of bones associated with it

215
0:16:18.480 --> 0:16:21.200
So that's not compatible with us right now

216
0:16:21.200 --> 0:16:25.080
I mean you could technically hook them all up, but like there's a lot of bones there

217
0:16:25.080 --> 0:16:28.800
I have some people that have taken bony faces and

218
0:16:28.800 --> 0:16:33.440
And baked the bone positions into blend shapes, which is a really cool way of doing it

219
0:16:33.440 --> 0:16:35.440
They add a bunch of bones to the face which allows

220
0:16:36.080 --> 0:16:41.440
Easy dragging around of those vertices and then they bake those to blend shapes and that way they work with our systems easier

221
0:16:41.760 --> 0:16:44.720
Um, but don't have those big bony faces

222
0:16:45.200 --> 0:16:48.320
It's kind of interesting like the way the assets are prepared like people like oh

223
0:16:48.320 --> 0:16:53.840
You're kind of good at 3d modeling prime and it's like I know how to make an anime avatar that is too lit

224
0:16:53.840 --> 0:16:58.720
Look good inside Neos. I don't know how to make a triple-a apps asset that could go to a natural game

225
0:16:58.720 --> 0:17:02.360
I have no idea moving forwards to a few more questions. So

226
0:17:03.360 --> 0:17:10.680
Juby asks, I'd assume that Neos would one day be launched into the public spotlight when that time comes

227
0:17:10.680 --> 0:17:14.320
What do you think will the integral element of keeping people interested in Neos?

228
0:17:15.240 --> 0:17:20.280
I'd like to say freedom of expression and freedom of creativity a lot of people are like, yeah

229
0:17:20.280 --> 0:17:26.440
It's just another social VR platform, but like yeah sure it is but like there's the freedom of expression and freedom of creativity there

230
0:17:26.440 --> 0:17:30.040
But I think we do a lot better than some other social platforms

231
0:17:30.680 --> 0:17:33.120
For example, they're not hiding on these platforms. They're great

232
0:17:33.120 --> 0:17:39.000
They just have different sort of targets if you look at something like rec room, for example, everything's very blocky

233
0:17:39.000 --> 0:17:45.120
It's it's great because you know, you can put stuff together there, but you can't do like crazy visual effects there

234
0:17:45.120 --> 0:17:48.960
Yeah, you can't do crazy avatars there. Yeah, you can do that here

235
0:17:48.960 --> 0:17:55.360
Um, you know stuff like that. We're a different platform for that. So like freedom of expression people will say like

236
0:17:57.160 --> 0:18:00.640
The community are only there because like the game's cool, right?

237
0:18:01.000 --> 0:18:06.240
If they form because the game is there and they'll hang on because the game with that but like they need that freedom

238
0:18:06.240 --> 0:18:09.440
they need that sort of platform to exist on and

239
0:18:10.000 --> 0:18:13.000
I think Neos is a good platform for that to exist on

240
0:18:13.000 --> 0:18:16.980
I think all the other social VR platforms are good for that to exist on hopping forwards

241
0:18:16.980 --> 0:18:21.260
A shadow coffee says what is summer summer is a game. It's a very good game

242
0:18:21.260 --> 0:18:26.780
Just search it so ma exactly how you spelt it. Very very good game. Leave were caught up on questions

243
0:18:26.780 --> 0:18:28.780
So I'm just gonna sit here in awkward silence

244
0:18:29.300 --> 0:18:33.380
Okay, we have another question from shadow coffee that says I saw a feature that meta is working on

245
0:18:33.380 --> 0:18:37.460
It basically puts down objects in places to ask the system to to do

246
0:18:37.940 --> 0:18:42.380
Example like you ask put the tree in this spot or a bench in this spot voice activated world building

247
0:18:42.380 --> 0:18:46.000
Is that something that we possible so you're talking there about sort of procedural generation?

248
0:18:46.000 --> 0:18:51.520
Um, there is a lot of tools exist there. I saw business lawyers typing earlier. He is a

249
0:18:52.360 --> 0:18:58.520
Load of tools which are great for creation like that. Then you added sort of voice activation

250
0:18:58.520 --> 0:19:03.320
That is something probably we'll look at in the future, but like not not to that level

251
0:19:03.840 --> 0:19:11.760
Like it's just like that's a very sort of complex compound question like to break it apart is like okay finding assets

252
0:19:11.760 --> 0:19:13.600
So you want to find a bench cool that search, right?

253
0:19:13.600 --> 0:19:18.160
So you'll be able to search through find a bench you want to put down cool placing it here

254
0:19:18.160 --> 0:19:20.760
That's about sort of grabbing it and moving it there

255
0:19:21.000 --> 0:19:21.560
All right

256
0:19:21.560 --> 0:19:26.960
Those are the operations you're talking about and then you could you could add voice activation at any point during those

257
0:19:27.160 --> 0:19:33.120
For example, you could say search for a bench cool and then search results appear for a bench, but like place it here

258
0:19:33.120 --> 0:19:36.480
I think you want to do that with the actual tools. I don't know. Oh, yeah, it's very possible

259
0:19:36.480 --> 0:19:40.780
Yeah, you can you can build that as well. I just I don't think it's useful like for search here

260
0:19:40.780 --> 0:19:48.240
Sure, maybe voice activated searches but like put a bench here where they told me to like say the coordinates place a bench exactly

261
0:19:48.760 --> 0:19:52.480
327 point two five five X by five hundred Y by

262
0:19:53.200 --> 0:19:58.640
200 Z and you're like cool. I'd rather just like put that visually or I need to put it

263
0:19:58.640 --> 0:20:02.440
I mean, maybe you can point like, you know put down a pin say here

264
0:20:02.480 --> 0:20:04.960
But at that point you've already done like half the job

265
0:20:04.960 --> 0:20:08.080
So just grab the bench and put it there gun Griffin asks

266
0:20:08.080 --> 0:20:13.760
Can you inject a sound that we use as audio stream? I'd like to add an audio marker to synchronize a piece of media

267
0:20:15.100 --> 0:20:19.940
Yes, but that wouldn't be inside. Yes. I have a very complicated audio setup

268
0:20:20.840 --> 0:20:26.400
Lots of it is muted and disabled but there is actually a square button on my go XLR mini here

269
0:20:26.480 --> 0:20:31.600
Which I've muted because it would send a loud beep noise of accidentally pushed it and that was hurting some people's ears

270
0:20:32.080 --> 0:20:35.160
But you know like that's inbuilt into the hardware

271
0:20:35.160 --> 0:20:38.920
I'm using to power my microphone and power my audio systems. It's nothing to do it

272
0:20:38.920 --> 0:20:41.680
Yes, I don't think it should be in some cases in some cases

273
0:20:41.680 --> 0:20:47.220
Maybe it could but like just virtual audio cable voice me a banana whatever you want to do it

274
0:20:47.220 --> 0:20:52.440
Just like figure it out a quick note on this one, which will probably head over to the be considerate page

275
0:20:52.440 --> 0:20:59.380
Do not under any circumstances ever play your Spotify playlist over your microphone channel. I

276
0:20:59.840 --> 0:21:01.080
will

277
0:21:01.080 --> 0:21:03.220
Eviscerate your existence from my world

278
0:21:03.220 --> 0:21:07.900
I have had Spotify since 2013. I don't need to hear

279
0:21:08.540 --> 0:21:14.780
Any of your music ever I want to hear my own music if you use an audio stream

280
0:21:14.780 --> 0:21:18.760
Which is a feature that we have that allows you to do that without it being on your microphone

281
0:21:18.820 --> 0:21:24.380
Then I have the choice to mute that audio stream and still hear your lovely voice, which is the actual thing

282
0:21:24.380 --> 0:21:27.900
I want to hear I want to converse with you. I don't want to hear your trashy music

283
0:21:27.900 --> 0:21:32.100
Thank you way too many people do that over in VR chat, and I just don't understand it

284
0:21:32.100 --> 0:21:36.980
I went to a world in VR chat recently where there were three people next to each other Oh

285
0:21:37.540 --> 0:21:41.300
Blasting over their microphone channel different genres of music and dancing to it

286
0:21:41.300 --> 0:21:43.220
I presume they'd all muted each other

287
0:21:43.220 --> 0:21:45.700
But I hadn't muted any of them because I'm trying to converse with them

288
0:21:45.700 --> 0:21:49.780
And so it was just a cacophony of just shit, and I don't want to hear that

289
0:21:49.940 --> 0:21:54.140
So don't do it over your microphone channel. Thank you moving on to the next question

290
0:21:54.140 --> 0:21:57.340
Is it normal that a collider does it shrink or grow?

291
0:21:57.340 --> 0:22:03.300
exactly the same size of an item I mess with when I shrink an object with colliders the collider kind of becomes

292
0:22:03.460 --> 0:22:08.060
Bigger compared to how much I shrunk the object and when I make it bigger the collider uses volume

293
0:22:08.300 --> 0:22:10.300
That would depend on how you've got it set up

294
0:22:10.740 --> 0:22:14.660
Most colliders are procedural and if they're not they're mesh colliders at which point

295
0:22:14.660 --> 0:22:18.540
They're directly tied to the vertices of the mesh, so they shouldn't really shrink or grow there

296
0:22:18.900 --> 0:22:21.180
You'll also see a weird thing that happens with

297
0:22:21.180 --> 0:22:27.540
Non uniform scaling never use none of uniform scaling if you do there are things that you need to do to make it work

298
0:22:27.540 --> 0:22:31.140
Or you can just choose to not use it, and you'll never have to remember those things to do

299
0:22:31.420 --> 0:22:34.180
I'd have to actually like see your object there to understand more

300
0:22:34.820 --> 0:22:37.140
That doesn't sound normal, but I don't know what it's set up

301
0:22:37.140 --> 0:22:42.340
It's causing that moving onwards nft hater says is snap to grid a thing in years there are very

302
0:22:42.860 --> 0:22:46.580
Varieties of snap to grid so there are snapping systems for example

303
0:22:46.580 --> 0:22:52.300
There is the builder tool bag happy which is a great tool for building stuff you can snap all sorts of things to a grid

304
0:22:52.300 --> 0:22:58.180
There there is the green laser 3000 which is a little bit of an older tool made by coffee is to work on this team

305
0:22:59.060 --> 0:23:02.260
That completely destroyed a world. I was working on when they were working on it

306
0:23:02.260 --> 0:23:09.220
And they apologized profusely and put my world back to you. Thank you so much for that that does snapping to grid there is logic

307
0:23:09.780 --> 0:23:16.020
Logics ray uvs ray uvs logics tip got that the right way around which does snapping to a grid for logics nodes

308
0:23:16.020 --> 0:23:20.100
There is red print which does again snapping to a grid for logics nodes

309
0:23:20.940 --> 0:23:25.140
There is native snapping which is sort of a weird feature that I would love to improve

310
0:23:25.140 --> 0:23:29.660
But it exists people are like what are like if you inspect something and you get that pink

311
0:23:29.660 --> 0:23:35.620
Cube that goes around it and it's got those yellow balls in the corner and everyone's like what are those yellow balls for I?

312
0:23:35.620 --> 0:23:39.340
Have a video on exactly what those yellow balls are for because they actually do something

313
0:23:39.340 --> 0:23:41.520
It's just a bit weird so that's snapping as well

314
0:23:41.520 --> 0:23:47.840
Then there's snappers, which are things like putting on hats or bracelets, or you know gadgets on yourself asks, whatever

315
0:23:48.480 --> 0:23:52.720
That's also snapping technically snapping to a grid because it snaps to an exact position

316
0:23:53.840 --> 0:24:00.440
Depends what you mean and what you want next shadow coffee is asking will Neos have AI NPC bots to hang out and talk to

317
0:24:00.840 --> 0:24:06.700
Yeah, uh you can build those we might have features in the future particularly animation features would be helpful there

318
0:24:06.700 --> 0:24:12.620
But you can build them they already exist there is a bot just this comes to mind

319
0:24:12.620 --> 0:24:15.300
There is basically like an NPC bot experience inside

320
0:24:16.500 --> 0:24:18.500
the

321
0:24:19.260 --> 0:24:25.580
Debug warrior that's a MSC entry that has a sort of tutorialized bot system. It's like here's how you play the game, right?

322
0:24:25.580 --> 0:24:27.580
That's an NPC or bot

323
0:24:28.180 --> 0:24:32.220
There are a couple a couple of social worlds which have bartenders in them

324
0:24:32.220 --> 0:24:37.700
They're not really that smart when it comes to NPCs or bots, but you know they hang out. They talk to you

325
0:24:38.340 --> 0:24:40.660
There is eco which is a map by

326
0:24:41.460 --> 0:24:43.460
another MSC entry for who's by

327
0:24:44.180 --> 0:24:47.380
That has a village of little foxes which mine

328
0:24:47.940 --> 0:24:51.320
My ore and cut down trees and bring it back to the village. That's really cool

329
0:24:51.820 --> 0:24:54.540
There's another MSC entry for the next year's MSC

330
0:24:55.340 --> 0:24:57.340
So the eco one was

331
0:24:57.340 --> 0:25:00.940
2020 or 21 remember for the most recent

332
0:25:00.940 --> 0:25:01.940
and

333
0:25:01.940 --> 0:25:08.300
This sorry the MSCs will blur together especially because the the distance between 21 and 22 is so short

334
0:25:09.380 --> 0:25:12.980
There's another one which is the traffic system. I think that was 21

335
0:25:13.980 --> 0:25:17.060
Which again had pathfinding AI and bots so that was cool

336
0:25:17.060 --> 0:25:21.300
I get a lot of questions like this, so I'll kind of elaborate a little bit some people like can you do this?

337
0:25:21.300 --> 0:25:23.300
The answer is they yeah, go build it

338
0:25:23.580 --> 0:25:28.720
Yeah, go build it. Yeah, go build it like if you if you don't know if you can do something

339
0:25:28.720 --> 0:25:36.340
Just go try and build it or ask can I build this not like will this happen can I build it sure brightness asks?

340
0:25:36.340 --> 0:25:41.020
Why is there a launch desktop mode option in the steam Neos launch options if it breaks the game?

341
0:25:41.020 --> 0:25:46.220
I straight-up use launch Neos and it works better launch desktop version doesn't break my game break sure game

342
0:25:46.220 --> 0:25:52.220
That sounds like a bug you should submit a bug report on our github the reason why those desktop options exist there are because

343
0:25:52.820 --> 0:25:57.740
Once you have a headset you need the options to not use it so yes

344
0:25:57.740 --> 0:26:02.380
Well by default when you don't use any of those launch options when you launch it. It'll be like cool

345
0:26:02.380 --> 0:26:06.840
I have detected that you have a headset plugged in I know you're not currently wearing it. I don't care

346
0:26:06.940 --> 0:26:12.460
I'm gonna launch into VR mode, and it's like sometimes you don't want that sometimes you want to hop on desktop mode

347
0:26:12.580 --> 0:26:19.100
So that launch desktop mode there is is mostly for VR users that have VR headsets and want to launch in desktop mode because they don't

348
0:26:19.100 --> 0:26:22.260
Want to play VR at that particular time? That's why all those launch options are there

349
0:26:22.860 --> 0:26:26.680
The one that forces you into steam VR mode that's there for people who run

350
0:26:26.680 --> 0:26:28.400
oculus

351
0:26:28.400 --> 0:26:33.300
Headsets, but with full body tracking using steam right they need steam to run

352
0:26:33.920 --> 0:26:38.200
But Neos will by default say yo you've got an oculus headset

353
0:26:38.200 --> 0:26:43.800
I'll run an oculus VR mode not steam VR mode you like buying to run in steam VR mode because I do full body tracking with

354
0:26:43.800 --> 0:26:47.600
Steam stuff so I need you to technically run both and so that's what that's for

355
0:26:47.880 --> 0:26:53.100
Torazo says once the ability to bookmark worlds you can actually do that. It's just a little bit weird right now

356
0:26:53.100 --> 0:26:56.720
It's really weird right now in the way that you do it, so if you want to bookmark a world

357
0:26:57.560 --> 0:27:03.640
Get the world up for it and save it to a folder tada bookmarks. It's a really weird way to do it

358
0:27:03.640 --> 0:27:09.600
It's not like any sort of bookmark that I would see but if you just save the world up to a folder

359
0:27:09.600 --> 0:27:14.080
If you've been marked it now you haven't saved a copy of that world when you save the world off

360
0:27:14.080 --> 0:27:15.160
So don't worry about your file space

361
0:27:15.160 --> 0:27:17.160
You've just saved a literal orb

362
0:27:17.160 --> 0:27:22.200
Which has the link to the world in it if you do save copy save as or something like that

363
0:27:22.200 --> 0:27:26.600
Then you've you've you know that will affect your your file storage

364
0:27:26.600 --> 0:27:31.040
But if you just save a copy of the world orb and the world orb itself you've got a favorite list

365
0:27:31.200 --> 0:27:36.080
It is more involved fuzzy. Yes. I did say it's not ideal, but you can do it

366
0:27:36.080 --> 0:27:41.760
Technically so brightness adds to the question about the launch desktop mode saying it would basically cut the connection between me and some users

367
0:27:41.760 --> 0:27:46.560
They'll get frozen on my end it also completely prevent me from seeing things that people would spawn that is a bug

368
0:27:46.560 --> 0:27:49.200
That's nothing to do with that desktop mode option. That is a bug

369
0:27:49.200 --> 0:27:53.720
That's another thing that continues to happen with users and trust me. I don't blame you for it

370
0:27:53.720 --> 0:28:00.400
It's just something that happens you see something weird, and then you use like your detective powers

371
0:28:00.400 --> 0:28:03.560
You're Sherlock Holmes ness, and you're like it must have been caused by this

372
0:28:03.920 --> 0:28:08.640
So the fact that I have an empty bag of Haribo gummy bears on my desk is the reason why Neos didn't start

373
0:28:09.000 --> 0:28:12.560
Usually not the case so when you come across something that doesn't make sense

374
0:28:13.000 --> 0:28:15.640
Please make a bug report and we'll be able to take a look at it

375
0:28:15.640 --> 0:28:22.720
Additionally when people are making bug reports, please make sure you provide the entire log file. Do not provide screenshots of the log file

376
0:28:22.720 --> 0:28:23.920
I can't read screenshots

377
0:28:23.920 --> 0:28:29.480
I can't copy and paste screenshots into our code base or into Google or into wherever I need to don't provide

378
0:28:30.040 --> 0:28:34.100
Segments of the log file as well some people like this error is surely the problem

379
0:28:34.100 --> 0:28:38.560
And I look and like that's the error that happens every five seconds inside Neos because of some bug we haven't fixed

380
0:28:38.680 --> 0:28:43.920
And then like two lines below that is the stuff that we need you haven't copied and pasted that one in your message

381
0:28:43.920 --> 0:28:46.120
You've just copy and pasted one bug. I can't see it

382
0:28:46.200 --> 0:28:53.320
So just the whole tire log file in your bug report, and if you don't make a bug report. We can't fix it

383
0:28:53.320 --> 0:28:54.440
We don't know about it

384
0:28:54.440 --> 0:28:56.140
Even if you come up to us in game

385
0:28:56.140 --> 0:29:01.640
And you tell us about a problem that you're having you might think that's reported you don't need to make a bug report

386
0:29:01.640 --> 0:29:07.040
That's incorrect unfortunately because we're human we're gonna forget about that bug report because we're in game

387
0:29:07.040 --> 0:29:11.120
We're busy what you need to do is go to the github make an official report

388
0:29:11.120 --> 0:29:15.800
Then come and speak to us about it because then we'll be able to like tie the two conversations together otherwise

389
0:29:15.800 --> 0:29:20.760
I'm literally just gonna forget. I will try my best to remember. I'm not being rude or anything. I'm just gonna forget

390
0:29:20.760 --> 0:29:26.120
It's just human nature shadow coffee says will Neos crypto coin be worth more than Bitcoin at some point

391
0:29:26.120 --> 0:29:28.120
Oh, no, probably not see announcements

392
0:29:28.920 --> 0:29:32.320
Double stick says do you think Neos is growth and development will progress?

393
0:29:32.320 --> 0:29:37.160
It's the main will rate with a closed source development model yes if we can fix hashtag announcements

394
0:29:37.160 --> 0:29:40.800
Open source development is an option, but it's not a mandate

395
0:29:40.800 --> 0:29:46.160
And I can't stand people that like oh it must be open source because XYZ reason doesn't need to be like is

396
0:29:47.640 --> 0:29:54.280
League of Legends open source node and how much money they made just sort of painting the same champions you play every day different colors

397
0:29:54.440 --> 0:30:00.680
Like oh, we're gonna do today prime module you do today. What if we painted them pink? Oh, yeah paint them pink

398
0:30:00.680 --> 0:30:08.520
Pink paint the pink charge another five bucks for a pink version of this character cool, and they make thousands and hundreds of you know

399
0:30:08.520 --> 0:30:10.520
They make millions of dollars that close source

400
0:30:10.760 --> 0:30:14.960
So just it is the time here GB if you have a question brightness of your question

401
0:30:14.960 --> 0:30:16.960
Please continue to type otherwise no more questions

402
0:30:17.200 --> 0:30:22.200
So double six is there a plan to a born board additional developers to the nearest team in the foreseeable future

403
0:30:22.360 --> 0:30:28.900
No, when we need them will get them however we can that's also weird because like that gets in the sort of ray of like

404
0:30:28.900 --> 0:30:33.780
Are they paid employees or are they not or are they volunteers if they're volunteers? What are they doing?

405
0:30:33.780 --> 0:30:37.700
Are they just know coming on board just to be like yo?

406
0:30:37.700 --> 0:30:39.700
I want to come on board and work on this one

407
0:30:39.980 --> 0:30:45.020
This one feature and then do nothing or are they coming on board to do exactly what we need to do or are we paying?

408
0:30:45.020 --> 0:30:47.020
them for paying them are they good and

409
0:30:47.420 --> 0:30:50.600
It's especially right now. Okay, so GBs question

410
0:30:50.600 --> 0:30:55.700
We've seen the application applications for education purposes and if you see bill plans on the future to expand to other fields

411
0:30:55.700 --> 0:30:58.540
Health care we have training on like it's already happening

412
0:30:59.460 --> 0:31:08.500
again, you have to sort of say go do it and really like, you know, drum that into people there is nothing stopping you do be or

413
0:31:09.300 --> 0:31:13.620
Double sticks or shadow coffee or chroma up there or brightness from tomorrow?

414
0:31:14.180 --> 0:31:18.580
Going to a research institution and saying you should use Neos for

415
0:31:20.540 --> 0:31:23.540
Cancer research you should use Neos for

416
0:31:23.540 --> 0:31:27.940
Or psychological research. I was reading a paper the other day about

417
0:31:29.460 --> 0:31:35.260
Exploring and researching how people with autism were processing various sort of scenes and

418
0:31:36.860 --> 0:31:43.180
Like environments they weren't using Neos, but they could easily use Neos. And so what they did was they had a kind of train station

419
0:31:43.980 --> 0:31:45.980
model or mock or room and

420
0:31:46.340 --> 0:31:52.740
They would change subtle things about the room. For example, they had a tiled floor that was black white tiled

421
0:31:52.740 --> 0:31:58.460
almost like a chessboard and then they would do eye tracking using the eye tracking features of the headset and

422
0:31:59.180 --> 0:32:04.100
See how you know people with autism without autism would process that environment

423
0:32:04.500 --> 0:32:11.480
because you get people that are hyper observant and people that are not hyper observant and you may notice that hey the

424
0:32:12.180 --> 0:32:15.860
Some users would basically scan the chessboard like it was a chessboard

425
0:32:16.380 --> 0:32:20.820
even though it's just a tiled floor and so then they removed the floor and

426
0:32:20.820 --> 0:32:26.620
They were like, okay, what does the eye tracking do now that you know, the floor has been removed or has been changed

427
0:32:26.660 --> 0:32:27.300
You know

428
0:32:27.300 --> 0:32:33.660
They could put groups of people within the environment and then sort of ask or ask the user to kind of navigate through that environment

429
0:32:33.660 --> 0:32:36.100
It's a great paper. I don't remember what the conclusion was or anything

430
0:32:36.100 --> 0:32:40.440
I just remember existed but the point is you could do that easily with a couple of like

431
0:32:40.980 --> 0:32:45.860
Toggle boxes and check boxes in Neos easily like incredibly easily

432
0:32:46.300 --> 0:32:50.420
Some of that stuff's already happening from the community. We already have research in there

433
0:32:50.420 --> 0:32:56.540
There's already a couple of scientific papers. Unfortunately don't mention Neos by name, but they used Neos and I'm aware of them

434
0:32:57.060 --> 0:33:02.580
Neos has also been in the newspaper again not mentioned by name. I was mentioned by name though. So it's already happening

435
0:33:02.580 --> 0:33:07.180
I think though to expand your question back into sort of realms of what the team can do

436
0:33:07.900 --> 0:33:14.620
The team could have someone that does that stuff with that community of researchers

437
0:33:14.620 --> 0:33:16.740
Oh, wait, they already do it's me

438
0:33:16.740 --> 0:33:23.140
Hello, if we were a more traditional company with the growth and the need to do it and the budget to do it

439
0:33:23.140 --> 0:33:30.140
I would predict that maybe in the future we would hire someone full-time to be like a community liaison for that particular market

440
0:33:30.460 --> 0:33:33.060
At which point they would be helping

441
0:33:34.220 --> 0:33:42.220
The community and users and companies of in the Neos community do more research using Neos that actual job role exists at unity

442
0:33:42.220 --> 0:33:45.320
For example, I was looking the other day. They have a job role open it for right now

443
0:33:45.320 --> 0:33:52.300
It would be a product manager who just does that they help our educational and nonprofit products projects using unity

444
0:33:52.380 --> 0:33:58.980
So if we were big enough to need that we would get it until we are just go do it go do it

445
0:33:58.980 --> 0:34:00.260
There's nothing stopping you

446
0:34:00.260 --> 0:34:06.980
I was calculating the angular velocity of an eyeball a couple of months ago fuzzy says is there an end in sight for halted updates?

447
0:34:07.500 --> 0:34:10.540
See the announcer's channel with that. I believe we're out of questions

448
0:34:10.540 --> 0:34:15.780
We go ahead and end things off here and speak to you later. If any further questions, please drop from the discord

449
0:34:15.780 --> 0:34:41.580
DM me block my DMS check the github check the wiki or just speak in the discord and I will speak to you later. Bye. Bye
