0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.480
Okay, it is the top of the hour, so welcome to prime time for documentation, tutorials

2
0:00:04.480 --> 0:00:05.880
and questions about Neas.

3
0:00:05.880 --> 0:00:10.060
Please drop your questions in the office hours chat and we'll get to them as soon as we can.

4
0:00:10.060 --> 0:00:16.040
I don't see any questions right now, so until there are questions appearing, I don't know.

5
0:00:16.040 --> 0:00:20.800
That monkey with the clapping cymbals, yes.

6
0:00:20.800 --> 0:00:40.720
Yes, until there are questions.

7
0:00:40.720 --> 0:01:08.720
Sorry, I don't answer cheese questions, just some questions about Neas, makes things easier.

8
0:01:08.720 --> 0:01:19.160
I will answer that one, I will.

9
0:01:19.160 --> 0:01:22.360
So Jamikar asks how my day has been.

10
0:01:22.360 --> 0:01:25.000
Good, yes, I have consumed way too much caffeine.

11
0:01:25.000 --> 0:01:30.400
I don't remember eating lunch, so I'll probably sort that out after this.

12
0:01:30.400 --> 0:01:32.800
It's also warming up a bit, which is great.

13
0:01:32.800 --> 0:01:36.720
I'm not looking forward to the summer, where it's going to be sort of air conditioning

14
0:01:36.720 --> 0:01:44.040
as well, but we're a little bit away from that just right now, so it's still cold sometimes.

15
0:01:44.040 --> 0:01:50.520
Okay, next question, which is from Gun Griffin, which says what point does the world preview

16
0:01:50.520 --> 0:01:52.160
get rendered from?

17
0:01:52.160 --> 0:01:57.480
World preview systems are very complicated depending on what the setup in the world is.

18
0:01:57.480 --> 0:02:04.760
Assuming a default world, it will get rendered randomly based on the geographic position

19
0:02:04.760 --> 0:02:06.620
of players who've been there.

20
0:02:06.620 --> 0:02:09.600
Actually periodically, I don't know the period, I think it's like every couple minutes, maybe

21
0:02:09.600 --> 0:02:15.200
every minute, I don't know the answer to that one.

22
0:02:15.200 --> 0:02:21.200
Every computer that is connected to Neos session will take a photo of the perspective of that

23
0:02:21.200 --> 0:02:26.680
user, and then there is sort of like a negotiation or exchange process that goes between the

24
0:02:26.680 --> 0:02:32.920
users in the session to figure out, hey, which is the most up to date thumbnail or session

25
0:02:32.920 --> 0:02:34.360
preview, et cetera.

26
0:02:34.360 --> 0:02:40.360
And then that most up to date one will then be shared with the actual systems that run

27
0:02:40.360 --> 0:02:47.880
our sessions, et cetera, and that's the one you see.

28
0:02:47.880 --> 0:02:50.800
You can check more out there.

29
0:02:50.800 --> 0:02:56.280
If you've got any of the components which are enabled, et cetera, then it will vary.

30
0:02:56.280 --> 0:03:04.720
The listing is right there for what they will do.

31
0:03:04.720 --> 0:03:08.920
Moving onwards to the next question here, which is, is there work being done on Neostruth

32
0:03:08.920 --> 0:03:09.920
during this time?

33
0:03:09.920 --> 0:03:10.920
Yeah, we're doing a few things.

34
0:03:10.920 --> 0:03:15.120
We don't really have much to share about what we're doing or who we're doing, but like I

35
0:03:15.120 --> 0:03:20.120
got lots of stuff happening, occasionally I edit the code, add stuff.

36
0:03:20.120 --> 0:03:24.600
The next update should have like a ton of prime stuff, basically, it's cool.

37
0:03:24.600 --> 0:03:27.720
So you'll see.

38
0:03:27.720 --> 0:03:28.880
The roadmap is still up to date.

39
0:03:28.880 --> 0:03:32.040
If the roadmap wasn't up to date, I would update it, trust me.

40
0:03:32.040 --> 0:03:40.080
But other than that, yeah, we're doing as much stuff as we can.

41
0:03:40.080 --> 0:03:55.120
Yeah, that's all the questions I have currently.

42
0:03:55.120 --> 0:04:02.320
Yeah, you won't see much updates.

43
0:04:02.320 --> 0:04:03.760
We're not releasing updates right now.

44
0:04:03.760 --> 0:04:11.880
We are doing stuff and the roadmap's up to date, but we're not releasing updates.

45
0:04:11.880 --> 0:04:16.040
I get it, it's confusing, et cetera, but remember, the roadmap's up to date.

46
0:04:16.040 --> 0:04:21.080
So like look at the roadmap and imagine us doing stuff.

47
0:04:21.080 --> 0:04:24.600
Who asks what is prime stuff?

48
0:04:24.600 --> 0:04:28.240
Some quality of life improvements, like for example getting the active slot from the collider

49
0:04:28.240 --> 0:04:30.040
much easier than it is currently.

50
0:04:30.040 --> 0:04:33.400
Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff in devlog which I've been posting.

51
0:04:33.400 --> 0:04:38.680
There's random other stuff, which is like things along the lines of like I got annoyed,

52
0:04:38.680 --> 0:04:40.680
so I implemented it.

53
0:04:40.680 --> 0:04:41.960
They're a little bit difficult to describe.

54
0:04:41.960 --> 0:04:48.440
I'd have to go take a look at what's actually made it in and then see which ones are still

55
0:04:48.440 --> 0:04:52.920
pending, and then we'll see what's going on there.

56
0:04:52.920 --> 0:04:57.920
Count occurrences was in devlog, collidery dudad, the grabadudad was in devlog.

57
0:04:57.920 --> 0:05:06.000
There's one other one I can't remember, but yeah, a bunch of other random stuff is happening.

58
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:08.680
You can see what I'm working on generically by the assigned issues.

59
0:05:08.680 --> 0:05:12.320
If you go to the issue list and you look at sort of assign to prime, those are the sort

60
0:05:12.320 --> 0:05:15.720
of things I'm dabbling in when I get time.

61
0:05:15.720 --> 0:05:18.120
So rubix asks when collections will be implemented.

62
0:05:18.120 --> 0:05:26.840
We don't give ATAs check the roadmap for information on collections and when that might happen.

63
0:05:26.840 --> 0:05:36.000
Crying asks where approximately on the priority list is a FTT or something that could enable

64
0:05:36.000 --> 0:05:37.760
for analysis transforms.

65
0:05:37.760 --> 0:05:43.200
So if you check your look in devlog, Gaines did take a look at making FTT and got things

66
0:05:43.200 --> 0:05:44.200
working.

67
0:05:44.200 --> 0:05:47.480
I don't think that aligned to some sort of architectural problems that we had in NIRS.

68
0:05:47.480 --> 0:05:49.880
We might have to redo that one.

69
0:05:49.880 --> 0:05:51.320
So take a look on the roadmap.

70
0:05:51.320 --> 0:05:55.120
We don't really have an NTA on when that would occur.

71
0:05:55.120 --> 0:05:58.800
I know it looks cool to see it working in the game, but there's a difference from working

72
0:05:58.800 --> 0:06:05.280
in the game as a quick sort of hacky project compared to working in the game, something

73
0:06:05.280 --> 0:06:06.800
that can actually be released.

74
0:06:06.800 --> 0:06:11.240
It's very difficult to unreleased stuff, so that's why we try to make sure everything's

75
0:06:11.240 --> 0:06:15.840
cool, secure, update, future proofed, et cetera, before we actually release it.

76
0:06:15.840 --> 0:06:18.800
That was actually a large problem with the counter occurrences node.

77
0:06:18.800 --> 0:06:22.920
I wrote that thing like three times because the particular way that we were counting the

78
0:06:22.920 --> 0:06:28.160
occurrences in a string could have been problematic, but then we made it a different way that was

79
0:06:28.160 --> 0:06:32.520
slightly less problematic, and then we just went ahead and benchmarked all of them and

80
0:06:32.520 --> 0:06:37.280
found a way that is something like 200 times faster than the previous three ways I was

81
0:06:37.280 --> 0:06:38.280
doing it.

82
0:06:38.280 --> 0:06:39.280
Always fun.

83
0:06:39.280 --> 0:06:41.800
Especially when you're reading the C sharp source.

84
0:06:41.800 --> 0:06:43.360
I don't really know why we did that.

85
0:06:43.360 --> 0:06:44.480
We just did.

86
0:06:44.480 --> 0:06:48.240
Sometimes we do that.

87
0:06:48.240 --> 0:06:51.040
If you, you know, too long didn't read on that is check the roadmap.

88
0:06:51.040 --> 0:06:54.640
I know it doesn't look like it's moving, but the thing that you need to remember is that

89
0:06:54.640 --> 0:07:01.080
even if a roadmap is not moving, it still represents work that is occurring.

90
0:07:01.080 --> 0:07:04.640
So it's sometimes normal to not see it moving because work is still occurring.

91
0:07:04.640 --> 0:07:06.360
It's not like work is not occurring.

92
0:07:06.360 --> 0:07:07.360
Work is occurring.

93
0:07:07.360 --> 0:07:14.960
It just is nothing we can share, really.

94
0:07:14.960 --> 0:07:17.960
Moving onwards from Nessie.

95
0:07:17.960 --> 0:07:24.760
I have a question here from Nessie, which says, is there anything good you can say about

96
0:07:24.760 --> 0:07:28.200
the unfolding situation with NCR?

97
0:07:28.200 --> 0:07:31.320
There are good things to say, but you can't come up with something to understand.

98
0:07:31.320 --> 0:07:32.320
Sorry for the NCR focus.

99
0:07:32.320 --> 0:07:38.200
I supported Neo since before crypto brews knew existed, but I'm, of course, highly impacted

100
0:07:38.200 --> 0:07:39.200
by the situation.

101
0:07:39.200 --> 0:07:43.000
Would like to see some better integration used for the marketplace job system.

102
0:07:43.000 --> 0:07:45.640
Everything I have to say on that matter is in the announcements channel.

103
0:07:45.640 --> 0:07:48.880
There is nothing else I can say about that.

104
0:07:48.880 --> 0:07:51.320
Check the announcements channel.

105
0:07:51.320 --> 0:07:56.000
Stance, et cetera.

106
0:07:56.000 --> 0:08:08.520
They're on the announcements channel.

107
0:08:08.520 --> 0:08:10.480
That's a slightly different question from crying surrogate.

108
0:08:10.480 --> 0:08:13.960
They're asking about buying storage.

109
0:08:13.960 --> 0:08:16.520
You can still supply to the Patreon.

110
0:08:16.520 --> 0:08:21.240
I know everyone's like, don't blah, blah, blah, blah.

111
0:08:21.240 --> 0:08:27.440
The things from Patreon that are still going towards stuff that you need still exist, though.

112
0:08:27.440 --> 0:08:31.800
Some portion of the Patreon goes to paying for our services.

113
0:08:31.800 --> 0:08:34.800
Those services that are paid for then pay for your storage.

114
0:08:34.800 --> 0:08:37.400
Hence why we give you storage when you become a Patreon.

115
0:08:37.400 --> 0:08:39.480
So don't cancel it if you need storage.

116
0:08:39.480 --> 0:08:42.240
Just drop it down or stuff like that.

117
0:08:42.240 --> 0:08:44.980
And then that way, you'll get the storage that you actually need.

118
0:08:44.980 --> 0:08:48.760
You'll still show your opinion by dropping the Patreon.

119
0:08:48.760 --> 0:09:14.760
You won't be outright losing access to storage.

120
0:09:14.760 --> 0:09:25.960
Just on the list of questions we have.

121
0:09:25.960 --> 0:09:31.640
We are interested in additional ways of gaining storage in the future.

122
0:09:31.640 --> 0:09:37.080
Things like a permanent increase may be costing a certain amount of money or stuff like that.

123
0:09:37.080 --> 0:09:39.720
But right now, those are the only two options that we have for storage.

124
0:09:39.720 --> 0:09:44.720
If you have any particular ideas about additional storage ideas, open up a GitHub for your idea

125
0:09:44.720 --> 0:09:45.720
that you have.

126
0:09:45.720 --> 0:09:46.800
I don't know.

127
0:09:46.800 --> 0:09:54.640
Maybe if we send Prime Cheese, he'll give you storage.

128
0:09:54.640 --> 0:09:59.240
Moving onwards, Gun Griffin asks, what's the general rule of thumb for user count when

129
0:09:59.240 --> 0:10:01.080
hosting based on your internet upload speed?

130
0:10:01.080 --> 0:10:03.740
There isn't a general rule.

131
0:10:03.740 --> 0:10:06.080
It's based on a lot of things.

132
0:10:06.080 --> 0:10:08.880
People imagine it as being a hard and fast rule.

133
0:10:08.880 --> 0:10:10.800
The same thing goes with system requirements.

134
0:10:10.800 --> 0:10:15.040
It depends on what you're doing, who you are, what the other people are doing, what their

135
0:10:15.040 --> 0:10:19.160
computers are like, what their internet connection is like, where they are, all sorts of stuff

136
0:10:19.160 --> 0:10:20.160
like that.

137
0:10:20.160 --> 0:10:23.280
You need to factor that all in together.

138
0:10:23.280 --> 0:10:27.880
You can measure the data requirements of an individual user and then extrapolate from

139
0:10:27.880 --> 0:10:28.880
that.

140
0:10:28.880 --> 0:10:32.320
But I just don't give recommendations on that.

141
0:10:32.320 --> 0:10:44.640
The question is too vague, what do you want?

142
0:10:44.640 --> 0:10:48.460
Hack 13 asks, is there any news progress on the switch to auth version of the NEEUS web

143
0:10:48.460 --> 0:10:49.460
login system?

144
0:10:49.460 --> 0:10:52.000
That's a bit of a sort of word soup question.

145
0:10:52.000 --> 0:10:55.280
I'll try and extrapolate an answer, though.

146
0:10:55.280 --> 0:11:01.160
That is on pause, whilst we deal with website related issues, sort of see announcements

147
0:11:01.160 --> 0:11:04.220
on that one.

148
0:11:04.220 --> 0:11:11.920
We need to basically rewrite 90 to 95% of the website to use the new systems and then

149
0:11:11.920 --> 0:11:14.760
actually get some useful functionality in place.

150
0:11:14.760 --> 0:11:16.480
We don't have any useful functionality there.

151
0:11:16.480 --> 0:11:20.960
You can get the profile data via OAuth, but you can't get anything else like friends,

152
0:11:20.960 --> 0:11:24.020
et cetera, stuff like that from the OAuth land.

153
0:11:24.020 --> 0:11:31.600
That's just because we need to rewrite most of the web APIs to then use that new process.

154
0:11:31.600 --> 0:11:35.440
Oh, hackers just updated things to say resetting password.

155
0:11:35.440 --> 0:11:40.560
Resetting password, that can be done via any place, it will do it exactly the same.

156
0:11:40.560 --> 0:11:46.040
You don't necessarily need it from the new system.

157
0:11:46.040 --> 0:11:47.320
You can use the old system.

158
0:11:47.320 --> 0:11:49.320
It's entirely up to you.

159
0:11:49.320 --> 0:11:52.240
Doesn't matter either way.

160
0:11:52.240 --> 0:11:55.640
If you wanted to reset your password another way, do you let me know or extrapolate on

161
0:11:55.640 --> 0:11:56.640
the actual problem?

162
0:11:56.640 --> 0:11:57.640
The old one?

163
0:11:57.640 --> 0:11:59.640
Oh, no, I'd have to double check.

164
0:11:59.640 --> 0:12:07.280
I'm sure you can do it on the old one, though.

165
0:12:07.280 --> 0:12:11.440
Moving forwards to alpha.

166
0:12:11.440 --> 0:12:16.000
Moving forwards to Svekin, who says what part of the snapper does the actual thinking, i.e.,

167
0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:19.960
does a snapper check for snap targets or does the snap targets check if snappers are inside

168
0:12:19.960 --> 0:12:23.480
the collider and do a lot of snap targets.

169
0:12:23.480 --> 0:12:26.960
Neither part does the thinking.

170
0:12:26.960 --> 0:12:33.560
Anything related to snappers, snapping, and grabable receivers, stuff like that, is actually

171
0:12:33.560 --> 0:12:40.640
performed by the grabber, so if you think about grabbing something, there is always

172
0:12:40.640 --> 0:12:43.520
an active user that is grabbing that because you're holding it.

173
0:12:43.520 --> 0:12:47.640
When you drop something in the world, when you let go of it, that's what does the snapper

174
0:12:47.640 --> 0:12:48.640
thinking.

175
0:12:48.640 --> 0:12:53.200
So I am holding a snappable object near its snap target.

176
0:12:53.200 --> 0:12:59.480
When I let go of that, the code which handles the letting go of it will go, cool, I have

177
0:12:59.480 --> 0:13:00.480
snapper components.

178
0:13:00.480 --> 0:13:06.080
I will do a physics calculation to figure out if I'm colliding with an appropriately

179
0:13:06.080 --> 0:13:09.840
configured snap target, and then I will snap into it.

180
0:13:09.840 --> 0:13:14.080
Once it's figured out if there is a snap target in place and that the object that you're dropping

181
0:13:14.080 --> 0:13:21.880
is a snapper, it will instruct the snapper to do its job, but again, the predominant

182
0:13:21.880 --> 0:13:25.040
thinking is via the grabable.

183
0:13:25.040 --> 0:13:31.640
As for the performance problems or questions that you have, no, or not really in like general

184
0:13:31.640 --> 0:13:37.200
use case, I can't think of many cases where you'd need like hundreds of snappers in existence.

185
0:13:37.200 --> 0:13:41.040
There might be some sort of like, I don't know, puzzle game style stuff, but it's totally

186
0:13:41.040 --> 0:13:42.040
fine.

187
0:13:42.040 --> 0:13:45.280
Just remember when it comes to physics calculations, just use them.

188
0:13:45.280 --> 0:13:52.040
I hate people who are like, I'm going to use manual mathematics rather than physics.

189
0:13:52.040 --> 0:13:54.720
It's like, why?

190
0:13:54.720 --> 0:13:57.160
Physics is already doing the manual mathematics for you.

191
0:13:57.160 --> 0:14:01.160
They're like, yeah, active colliders are bad, and yes, active colliders are quite inherently

192
0:14:01.160 --> 0:14:04.560
bad, but if you use them correctly, they're great.

193
0:14:04.560 --> 0:14:07.840
Same thing goes with the grabable physics calculations.

194
0:14:07.840 --> 0:14:11.320
Especially seeing as those are out of the way of you, like you can't influence them.

195
0:14:11.320 --> 0:14:15.020
Those exist in code within our engine that you can't change.

196
0:14:15.020 --> 0:14:19.520
If there was a performance problem with snappers or grabables, we'd fix it.

197
0:14:19.520 --> 0:14:20.520
It's totally fine.

198
0:14:20.520 --> 0:14:24.960
If it's just hats, scarves, bracelets, whatever you want to snap to your avatar, you're totally

199
0:14:24.960 --> 0:14:25.960
fine.

200
0:14:25.960 --> 0:14:30.080
If you've got a lot of snappables in the same location, hey, maybe that'll be a problem,

201
0:14:30.080 --> 0:14:34.640
but that's really only going to come up in exact places, probably games.

202
0:14:34.640 --> 0:14:38.080
Puzzle games will probably come up occasionally.

203
0:14:38.080 --> 0:14:40.200
I'm not too worried about that.

204
0:14:40.200 --> 0:14:47.200
You'd experience that in your individual experience that you're crafting.

205
0:14:47.200 --> 0:14:50.920
Who asks what is the importance of being able to have a local storage that if you want to

206
0:14:50.920 --> 0:14:58.120
save an item, I can save it to a local inventory instead of a local home with a bunch of objects?

207
0:14:58.120 --> 0:15:00.320
Are you asking me what I think the importance is?

208
0:15:00.320 --> 0:15:04.040
Are you asking where it's ranked in our priority list?

209
0:15:04.040 --> 0:15:06.280
Are you asking are we thinking about it?

210
0:15:06.280 --> 0:15:16.720
What's your question?

211
0:15:16.720 --> 0:15:17.720
It is considered.

212
0:15:17.720 --> 0:15:18.720
You can find a GitHub issue for it.

213
0:15:18.720 --> 0:15:20.240
I won't be able to pull that out of my head.

214
0:15:20.240 --> 0:15:21.240
It's not in there.

215
0:15:21.240 --> 0:15:28.720
But there is some area where we're thinking about it to enable it as another storage option.

216
0:15:28.720 --> 0:15:30.320
There's another one on the storage options I mean.

217
0:15:30.320 --> 0:15:35.960
We are looking at other ways that we can provide storage to people on various types and platforms

218
0:15:35.960 --> 0:15:37.400
and things like that.

219
0:15:37.400 --> 0:15:38.720
It is on the list.

220
0:15:38.720 --> 0:15:41.240
I would not be able to comment on the priority.

221
0:15:41.240 --> 0:15:42.240
I don't know.

222
0:15:42.240 --> 0:15:43.240
We don't give ETA's.

223
0:15:43.240 --> 0:15:46.440
Check the roadmap for information.

224
0:15:46.440 --> 0:15:53.720
If you like that feature, remember to thumbs up it on the GitHub and to vote on it using

225
0:15:53.720 --> 0:15:59.320
your priority Patreon priority voting rights.

226
0:15:59.320 --> 0:16:10.080
Moving on, do you know what single threaded bottlenecks might be in the engine?

227
0:16:10.080 --> 0:16:11.880
Do you have any ideas on how to improve them?

228
0:16:11.880 --> 0:16:15.240
There's lots of areas that Fruix is aware of that need to be improved.

229
0:16:15.240 --> 0:16:19.440
There are also lots of areas that Gaines is aware of that need to be improved.

230
0:16:19.440 --> 0:16:24.040
The single greatest improvement we can have right now is moving off of Unity.

231
0:16:24.040 --> 0:16:28.280
That's really what Gaines is trying to focus on.

232
0:16:28.280 --> 0:16:32.560
That's why you'll see stuff happening that isn't a weird or seemingly random order on

233
0:16:32.560 --> 0:16:33.560
Gaines' land.

234
0:16:33.560 --> 0:16:39.280
Gaines wants to get colors under control such that we can start moving to better systems.

235
0:16:39.280 --> 0:16:42.400
That's something we would need before we start moving to better systems is to understand

236
0:16:42.400 --> 0:16:46.440
the color spaces of all the content on there or it's going to start looking really weird

237
0:16:46.440 --> 0:16:49.440
when we have to jump to different rendering engines.

238
0:16:49.440 --> 0:16:54.840
Beyond that, the other cause of problem was that Bepu on physics we updated to Bepu 2.

239
0:16:54.840 --> 0:16:58.680
There are a bunch of other cases which come up which don't seem like they would.

240
0:16:58.680 --> 0:17:04.360
Any old UI that's using the old UI system isn't really designed for expandability scale

241
0:17:04.360 --> 0:17:07.800
or anything like that, so that can be a problem.

242
0:17:07.800 --> 0:17:11.080
I do believe as well from speaking to Fruix that there are some advancements that he wants

243
0:17:11.080 --> 0:17:13.920
to make to the dynamic bone system to make that a little bit more performant.

244
0:17:13.920 --> 0:17:18.200
If you really want to know more performance related stuff, I would probably head on over

245
0:17:18.200 --> 0:17:19.200
to Gaines.

246
0:17:19.200 --> 0:17:20.920
I know they're currently not doing office hours.

247
0:17:20.920 --> 0:17:24.880
I was actually removing them from the active list on the office hours wiki page, but there

248
0:17:24.880 --> 0:17:30.760
would be a better sort of ask about the general performance of the engine.

249
0:17:30.760 --> 0:17:35.400
We do also have an optimization roadmap which has a lot of stuff pinned in there and listed

250
0:17:35.400 --> 0:17:36.400
on there.

251
0:17:36.400 --> 0:17:40.400
I know there's another one sort of in the areas of web requests where we want to move

252
0:17:40.400 --> 0:17:47.560
a lot more stuff to signal R such that we can not have to poll.

253
0:17:47.560 --> 0:17:51.120
Right now we do a lot of polling, which is basically every couple of seconds or however

254
0:17:51.120 --> 0:17:52.120
long it is.

255
0:17:52.120 --> 0:17:53.120
It's probably every 30 seconds.

256
0:17:53.120 --> 0:17:55.520
For some cases, it just depends on what operation it is.

257
0:17:55.520 --> 0:18:01.000
We have to knock at the door on Nia's cloud services and say, yo, got anything new?

258
0:18:01.000 --> 0:18:03.320
Yo, got anything new?

259
0:18:03.320 --> 0:18:10.680
When that drops over to signal R, we don't have to do that.

260
0:18:10.680 --> 0:18:13.400
Moving on to Luca's question.

261
0:18:13.400 --> 0:18:16.280
Regardless of headless and storage, will there be a way for those headless systems at some

262
0:18:16.280 --> 0:18:19.760
point to have their own cache for content, tools, et cetera, where if you're on a LAN

263
0:18:19.760 --> 0:18:23.800
with no internet connectivity, you'd still be able to show off a game, movie tools, and

264
0:18:23.800 --> 0:18:26.800
be able to have all users access the local host source?

265
0:18:26.800 --> 0:18:27.800
Already exists.

266
0:18:27.800 --> 0:18:32.520
There's just a lot of limitations.

267
0:18:32.520 --> 0:18:39.080
If you have everything that you need stored inside the local home or a world which has

268
0:18:39.080 --> 0:18:41.560
saved the local home, then you don't need internet.

269
0:18:41.560 --> 0:18:45.200
I already used that with a bunch of the scientific projects I'm working on.

270
0:18:45.200 --> 0:18:46.360
It works well.

271
0:18:46.360 --> 0:18:49.080
You just frequently need to update what you need access to.

272
0:18:49.080 --> 0:18:53.880
For example, the default avatar unfortunately doesn't work if you're offline, or at least

273
0:18:53.880 --> 0:18:55.240
it didn't the last time I was testing it.

274
0:18:55.240 --> 0:18:59.200
I did make a GitHub about it, and it is something I'm looking into because I don't think that

275
0:18:59.200 --> 0:19:00.200
that's acceptable.

276
0:19:00.200 --> 0:19:04.400
It makes me sort of angry that that is the case.

277
0:19:04.400 --> 0:19:08.480
To fix that, what I did with the local world content is I just shoved the default avatar

278
0:19:08.480 --> 0:19:13.000
into one of those worlds, hit save, set it up in the user spawn such that it uses that

279
0:19:13.000 --> 0:19:16.040
one, not the cloud spawned one, and then it does work whilst offline.

280
0:19:16.040 --> 0:19:18.680
You just need to make sure that everything is saved there.

281
0:19:18.680 --> 0:19:25.040
Better management of local storage will enable better handling there, as will better management

282
0:19:25.040 --> 0:19:28.760
for offline saved stuff that can't work without internet.

283
0:19:28.760 --> 0:19:30.320
It is possible right now.

284
0:19:30.320 --> 0:19:38.200
I do it regularly.

285
0:19:38.200 --> 0:19:43.360
Messy asks if my patron subscription gets me a creation group, what happens to the group's

286
0:19:43.360 --> 0:19:47.040
folder and other things if I decrease my patron level to which it does not include a group?

287
0:19:47.040 --> 0:19:48.700
We will never delete content.

288
0:19:48.700 --> 0:19:49.700
We don't want to do that.

289
0:19:49.700 --> 0:19:50.700
We don't believe in that.

290
0:19:50.700 --> 0:19:56.840
If you get a group which has a certain file storage size and you stop paying for patron,

291
0:19:56.840 --> 0:19:59.400
we will allow you to still have that content.

292
0:19:59.400 --> 0:20:02.680
You won't be able to save any new content to that group, but any existing content will

293
0:20:02.680 --> 0:20:03.680
not be deleted.

294
0:20:03.680 --> 0:20:09.400
That includes your group world and group inventory folders.

295
0:20:09.400 --> 0:20:10.400
So the group will still exist.

296
0:20:10.400 --> 0:20:16.520
It will kind of just be like, I'm going to use air quotes here on the camera, like, locked.

297
0:20:16.520 --> 0:20:18.040
You can't do anything with it.

298
0:20:18.040 --> 0:20:25.240
It will still exist, but you can't really do much with it.

299
0:20:25.240 --> 0:20:31.240
Shockmare asks, or states, really, I haven't really looked into SignalR as a kind of event-based

300
0:20:31.240 --> 0:20:32.240
system.

301
0:20:32.240 --> 0:20:36.200
But if you're familiar with any other event-based system, even as simple as basically just sort

302
0:20:36.200 --> 0:20:41.640
of like Discord, what we're using here, there is basically a data layer that sends messages

303
0:20:41.640 --> 0:20:45.840
between people and lets them know that there's stuff there.

304
0:20:45.840 --> 0:20:48.520
My first exposure to that when I was learning computing was IRC.

305
0:20:48.520 --> 0:20:52.400
You connect to a data channel and it sends data to you.

306
0:20:52.400 --> 0:20:56.540
Another good example would be the difference between web sockets and just regular, like,

307
0:20:56.540 --> 0:20:57.540
web requests.

308
0:20:57.540 --> 0:21:03.440
SignalR isn't allowing us to send a message to you, like, hey, I have new stuff, rather

309
0:21:03.440 --> 0:21:07.320
than you knocking at our door saying, do you have new stuff, we send a message to you saying,

310
0:21:07.320 --> 0:21:10.360
I have new stuff here it is, and that way you don't need to pull.

311
0:21:10.360 --> 0:21:19.120
It is warped in a lot of cases.

312
0:21:19.120 --> 0:21:22.920
Hack 13 said, I heard before there was throttling to the SS server if you're doing a Patreon.

313
0:21:22.920 --> 0:21:24.680
If this is true, what is the throttling?

314
0:21:24.680 --> 0:21:25.680
That's not true anymore.

315
0:21:25.680 --> 0:21:29.440
If you heard it somewhere, please let me know and delete it.

316
0:21:29.440 --> 0:21:30.940
It does not occur anymore.

317
0:21:30.940 --> 0:21:32.320
I removed it from the Wiki.

318
0:21:32.320 --> 0:21:33.760
I talked about it before.

319
0:21:33.760 --> 0:21:34.760
It does not occur.

320
0:21:34.760 --> 0:21:41.240
We removed that perk and moved everyone to the same sort of transmitting for assets.

321
0:21:41.240 --> 0:21:42.700
There's no throttling.

322
0:21:42.700 --> 0:21:44.800
There was no throttling to begin with.

323
0:21:44.800 --> 0:21:52.720
It was just historically, not now, historically that we had a slightly faster CDN for Patreon

324
0:21:52.720 --> 0:21:53.720
users.

325
0:21:53.720 --> 0:21:54.900
So downloads were slightly faster.

326
0:21:54.900 --> 0:21:55.900
It wasn't throttling.

327
0:21:55.900 --> 0:21:56.900
It was the opposite.

328
0:21:56.900 --> 0:21:59.760
We gave more speed to people that had Patreon.

329
0:21:59.760 --> 0:22:01.720
I don't think we'd ever throttle your content.

330
0:22:01.720 --> 0:22:02.720
That's ridiculous.

331
0:22:02.720 --> 0:22:08.920
Messy has a follow-up question on the main group question, which is, and it will be there

332
0:22:08.920 --> 0:22:11.800
if I increase it back.

333
0:22:11.800 --> 0:22:12.800
The group will never be deleted.

334
0:22:12.800 --> 0:22:14.080
You'll still be able to access it.

335
0:22:14.080 --> 0:22:16.080
You just won't be able to save anything new to it.

336
0:22:16.080 --> 0:22:19.600
So it will still be in your inventory system.

337
0:22:19.600 --> 0:22:21.760
You'll still be able to open the group world.

338
0:22:21.760 --> 0:22:23.880
You just won't be able to save things.

339
0:22:23.880 --> 0:22:28.600
So yes, and then if you increase your pledge back to support that, then you'll be able

340
0:22:28.600 --> 0:22:30.480
to save stuff again.

341
0:22:30.480 --> 0:22:43.280
So it's like read only, I guess, is the word I'm looking for.

342
0:22:43.280 --> 0:22:47.280
Sarai has a question, and they say, it's on the fly, so forgive me.

343
0:22:47.280 --> 0:22:52.560
Are there plans to implement some kind of cache delay Atlas, presuming you mean Atlas,

344
0:22:52.560 --> 0:22:57.520
stuff in the cache that is older than X days to combat the whole full drive problem?

345
0:22:57.520 --> 0:23:02.440
Yeah, we have better cache management on an issue to enable you to sort of say what's

346
0:23:02.440 --> 0:23:03.440
going on.

347
0:23:03.440 --> 0:23:07.440
Optimizations in the way that we store cache items there will also help, but I think it

348
0:23:07.440 --> 0:23:09.520
will be a lot more important to sort of give you the control there.

349
0:23:09.520 --> 0:23:13.480
What I would love is some sort of setting, UI, something some way that basically says

350
0:23:13.480 --> 0:23:18.400
like, hey, here is a limit that Neos, don't go over this damn limit.

351
0:23:18.400 --> 0:23:24.440
And then based on that, it won't go over that limit, or maybe it'll delete stuff that's

352
0:23:24.440 --> 0:23:25.440
older.

353
0:23:25.440 --> 0:23:27.940
That is cool, sort of better cache management is I guess what you'd be searching for on

354
0:23:27.940 --> 0:23:35.200
the GitHub.

355
0:23:35.200 --> 0:23:36.480
That's all the questions I have currently.

356
0:23:36.480 --> 0:23:40.760
I'm gonna go ahead and in the intersperse time between looking for more questions, I'm

357
0:23:40.760 --> 0:23:52.240
gonna go ahead and take a look at that whole forgot password problem that we have.

358
0:23:52.240 --> 0:23:53.640
Thought there was a way to do it on the old site.

359
0:23:53.640 --> 0:23:56.640
It looks like there's not a way to do it on the old site.

360
0:23:56.640 --> 0:24:00.680
Account.neos.com should be able to enable you to reset your password.

361
0:24:00.680 --> 0:24:04.600
Not account.neos.com, auth.neos.com.

362
0:24:04.600 --> 0:24:09.000
Sorry, there's like three different websites.

363
0:24:09.000 --> 0:24:19.320
Yes, auth.neos.com will enable you to reset your password.

364
0:24:19.320 --> 0:24:23.080
Hack asks, can you allocate your personal space to the group?

365
0:24:23.080 --> 0:24:24.080
No.

366
0:24:24.080 --> 0:24:26.400
Groups have a different space limit than you.

367
0:24:26.400 --> 0:24:29.480
You cannot move space between them.

368
0:24:29.480 --> 0:24:35.800
You can, however, allocate how much space individual users can take up within that group

369
0:24:35.800 --> 0:24:36.800
storage.

370
0:24:36.800 --> 0:24:58.480
That's like the other way around, that's not exactly what you're asking.

371
0:24:58.480 --> 0:25:28.440
Hack asks, will there be a way to grow strict pay for more group storage?

372
0:25:28.440 --> 0:25:29.440
Yes.

373
0:25:29.440 --> 0:25:34.360
I would love to see groups being entirely overhauled to be a thing that, A, doesn't

374
0:25:34.360 --> 0:25:36.200
require Shifty's help.

375
0:25:36.200 --> 0:25:40.200
She's amazing, but she has other responsibilities, and I would love her to be able to focus on

376
0:25:40.200 --> 0:25:41.200
those.

377
0:25:41.200 --> 0:25:45.560
There's no reason we can't automate group creation, very easy.

378
0:25:45.560 --> 0:25:51.680
I would love it if we could just make groups more feel like a group.

379
0:25:51.680 --> 0:25:56.280
There should be some sort of sense of community about that group, some sort of sense of identity

380
0:25:56.280 --> 0:25:57.720
about that group.

381
0:25:57.720 --> 0:26:05.160
And then features, et cetera, that will allow that.

382
0:26:05.160 --> 0:26:31.960
Absolutely contributing to a group, stuff like that, absolutely.

383
0:26:31.960 --> 0:26:50.500
Thank you.

384
0:27:12.500 --> 0:27:14.500
We have another question here, sorry I had to type something.

385
0:27:14.500 --> 0:27:16.500
Let's just alt-tab around a little bit.

386
0:27:16.500 --> 0:27:25.500
So we have a question here from Gun Griffin which says, is it better to have accessories or different avatar items as a separate mesh with a few weight groups or in the same skin mesh with all the bone weights?

387
0:27:25.500 --> 0:27:30.500
Split up your skin meshes as much as possible, particularly if there's no deformation.

388
0:27:30.500 --> 0:27:45.500
A good example here, and this is like hyper-optimization so don't panic if you're not this case, if you have no body blend shapes, then split your head off from your body and that will provide a little bit more optimization to your avatar.

389
0:27:45.500 --> 0:27:55.500
Because the blend shape groups and listings will only exist for your actual head and not the rest of your body and then we'll be able to sort of optimize the body a little bit better.

390
0:27:55.500 --> 0:28:11.500
When it comes to accessories and stuff like that, if that accessory is designed to always be there, I don't know it's a hat or a scarf that's always part of the avatar, sure make it the same mesh, sure join it together, sure optimize it with the same materials, etc.

391
0:28:11.500 --> 0:28:16.500
If you ever want to take it off, it needs to be a separate mesh, that's basically it really.

392
0:28:16.500 --> 0:28:20.500
You could optimize to hell.

393
0:28:20.500 --> 0:28:28.500
One of my avatars has one material, one skinned mesh, fake blend shapes and you wouldn't know it.

394
0:28:28.500 --> 0:28:35.500
Another one doesn't and in some cases you wouldn't know it because I'm not extreme with my unoptimization.

395
0:28:35.500 --> 0:28:42.500
Best things that you can do are to just assume that you are, like plan out the avatar is what I mean.

396
0:28:42.500 --> 0:28:49.500
Sometimes the problems of optimization are not planning.

397
0:28:49.500 --> 0:29:01.500
You import the avatar and then like five minutes after importing the avatar you're like, well I actually need like a hat and 50,000 multi-tools inside my, inside my belt.

398
0:29:01.500 --> 0:29:11.500
And I need four copies of Ivali, of sorry, of Ryuvi's Edge of Reality doodad inside my belt.

399
0:29:11.500 --> 0:29:17.500
And you know, I need half of sketchfab parented to me, that's absolutely amazing what I want.

400
0:29:17.500 --> 0:29:25.500
Oh yeah, you should always zero as clear out weight groups that aren't meant to be there.

401
0:29:25.500 --> 0:29:37.500
That's just good practice in like making the avatar in general.

402
0:29:37.500 --> 0:29:51.500
I just do that in principle though because like sometimes when the orthonormalization of weight painting is happening you end up with like some fun stuff there.

403
0:29:51.500 --> 0:30:01.500
Crying surrogate has a question here which is, do default tool tips contribute to avatar asset size?

404
0:30:01.500 --> 0:30:07.500
No, the way that the size is displayed in the inventory screen isn't that accurate.

405
0:30:07.500 --> 0:30:12.500
A good way of looking at it is to think about a manifest of your avatar.

406
0:30:12.500 --> 0:30:14.500
So this is going to be quoted I know.

407
0:30:14.500 --> 0:30:18.500
Think of your avatar like it's an airplane.

408
0:30:18.500 --> 0:30:25.500
The mesh of the airplanes, the outer like holes of the airplane, that's a mesh, right?

409
0:30:25.500 --> 0:30:26.500
So that's a separate asset.

410
0:30:26.500 --> 0:30:33.500
So its file size is then added to maybe the mesh of the inside of the airplane, the seats, that's a separate asset.

411
0:30:33.500 --> 0:30:40.500
And then the textures on that plane, both from the outside and inside, that's a separate asset.

412
0:30:40.500 --> 0:30:47.500
And then add those all together up and then you get the size of the final avatar.

413
0:30:47.500 --> 0:30:50.500
Airplane is actually a good thing for this next part though.

414
0:30:50.500 --> 0:30:58.500
If your asset is shared with another user or any of the standard assets, then the first person to upload it will have the file size allocated to them.

415
0:30:58.500 --> 0:31:06.500
As an example here, which happens a lot with avatar bases, if you use the identical avatar base to someone who uploaded the avatar and made it into an avatar,

416
0:31:06.500 --> 0:31:11.500
as in if someone gives you their avatar base and you just change out the textures.

417
0:31:11.500 --> 0:31:15.500
I don't know, your friend is a red dog, you're a blue dog.

418
0:31:15.500 --> 0:31:21.500
If they uploaded the red dog and did the avatar setup process and the meshes are identical, so it uses the same mesh,

419
0:31:21.500 --> 0:31:29.500
the only change is that you change your textures to be a blue dog, then they will have the file size allocated for the mesh.

420
0:31:29.500 --> 0:31:35.500
You will just have the file space allocated for the blue dog texture.

421
0:31:35.500 --> 0:31:39.500
Yeah, everything's separated. It just manifests everything out, like everything's manifested.

422
0:31:39.500 --> 0:31:45.500
So if you are looking at any asset, just explode it.

423
0:31:45.500 --> 0:31:51.500
Don't imagine planes exploding, but imagine it exploding into all its component parts and those are all saved separately.

424
0:31:51.500 --> 0:31:56.500
Every static mesh, every static texture, all saved separately.

425
0:31:56.500 --> 0:32:01.500
If there are overlaps, which is probably a better wording for what I was saying earlier, rather than talking about planes and dogs,

426
0:32:01.500 --> 0:32:10.500
then everything that is unique to you is allocated to your size.

427
0:32:10.500 --> 0:32:15.500
Grun asks, if they delete their copy, do you inherit the file size? I think so. I don't know.

428
0:32:15.500 --> 0:32:19.500
I'd have to poke around a little bit.

429
0:32:19.500 --> 0:32:25.500
It is really wishy-washy on how that whole system works,

430
0:32:25.500 --> 0:32:31.500
particularly in cases where it's assets that are in public folders and things like that or assets that are sort of shared around a lot.

431
0:32:31.500 --> 0:32:40.500
It gets to the point where we have a direct sort of incentive from us as a company to keep assets around.

432
0:32:40.500 --> 0:32:44.500
If it's just you, it's your special avatar and you decide to leave the platform, fine.

433
0:32:44.500 --> 0:32:47.500
OK, you leave the platform, we delete that. We actually delete that.

434
0:32:47.500 --> 0:32:51.500
But in some cases, it's like, well, this is in like five shared folders.

435
0:32:51.500 --> 0:32:55.500
This meme has been shared around to like 20 different people.

436
0:32:55.500 --> 0:33:01.500
We have no real idea who the original owner is, but someone just deleted it.

437
0:33:01.500 --> 0:33:05.500
Like, do we actually delete it? No, of course not. It's really complicated.

438
0:33:05.500 --> 0:33:11.500
The license system will help with that, as we'll be able to see the originator of the asset, both in terms of sort of like when to delete something,

439
0:33:11.500 --> 0:33:16.500
the path, the trajectory of something, who owned it, why they owned it, stuff like that.

440
0:33:16.500 --> 0:33:32.500
And also to sort of handle and maybe optimize file storage in some cases.

441
0:33:32.500 --> 0:33:37.500
Going back to that plane analogy for a bit, everything about the passengers, that's unique to them.

442
0:33:37.500 --> 0:33:46.500
But the plane, pretty stock standard, you know, one 747 for one airline is identical to another 747 for an airline when it comes to digital.

443
0:33:46.500 --> 0:34:15.500
It's not in reality.

444
0:34:15.500 --> 0:34:17.500
We are over time at this point.

445
0:34:17.500 --> 0:34:29.500
So Goan Griffin and Fuzzy, if you have a question, please enter them.

446
0:34:29.500 --> 0:34:33.500
Fuzzy, I would encourage you to use the inventory system. We get this a lot.

447
0:34:33.500 --> 0:34:36.500
And this is something that I try to explain to people and they don't understand.

448
0:34:36.500 --> 0:34:38.500
They're like, oh, you're being difficult.

449
0:34:38.500 --> 0:34:41.500
I'm not. I'm just explaining to you why there's an inventory system.

450
0:34:41.500 --> 0:34:46.500
So you come to New York, you're new and you're like, cool, it's an inventory system.

451
0:34:46.500 --> 0:34:49.500
I can put stuff in my inventory. I can save it. That's great.

452
0:34:49.500 --> 0:34:54.500
At a certain point, you start parenting stuff to your avatar and stop using the inventory system.

453
0:34:54.500 --> 0:34:59.500
I need a gun. I'll parent it to my avatar. I need a different gun. I'll parent it to my avatar.

454
0:34:59.500 --> 0:35:05.500
And I'm like, or pop open your inventory and spawn the gun you need at the time you need it.

455
0:35:05.500 --> 0:35:07.500
Stop laboring yourself.

456
0:35:07.500 --> 0:35:14.500
You don't have to walk around like it's Fallout 4 and you've got like 5000 years of.

457
0:35:14.500 --> 0:35:22.500
What are they called? Radroach like legs in your inventory and, you know, try to like just like leave it in your inventory.

458
0:35:22.500 --> 0:35:28.500
I want a blue version of my avatar, so I will do this complicated logic set up so that my avatar can be blue.

459
0:35:28.500 --> 0:35:35.500
Maybe just save a blue copy of your avatar and then swap into it when you want to be blue.

460
0:35:35.500 --> 0:35:38.500
I need to a lot more sort of betterness.

461
0:35:38.500 --> 0:35:42.500
That also goes on to the question, which I didn't answer. I apologize. I missed it.

462
0:35:42.500 --> 0:35:47.500
I don't have a helpful person ticking and marking questions today, which is...

463
0:35:47.500 --> 0:35:52.500
Actually, I missed two questions. I'm so sorry. I'll jump through those real quick.

464
0:35:52.500 --> 0:35:59.500
Cesari asks, what's the worst crimes that we've seen done in logic so far that made you just not deal with it?

465
0:35:59.500 --> 0:36:09.500
It's honestly mono packing. It just it takes the whole concept of logics and the engine and everything like that and just laughs at it.

466
0:36:09.500 --> 0:36:15.500
There is nothing we can do as like a team to convince you not to do that.

467
0:36:15.500 --> 0:36:20.500
But there's also nothing we can do as a team to undo that or optimize it for you in the future.

468
0:36:20.500 --> 0:36:24.500
Say, for example, we like completely reverse engineer and make logics better.

469
0:36:24.500 --> 0:36:31.500
If it's all regular logics, we do it all the time, like we update nodes, we change how they work, we make them more efficient.

470
0:36:31.500 --> 0:36:35.500
And it's so easy for us to update them because all those nodes are separate and they make sense.

471
0:36:35.500 --> 0:36:43.500
But if you sort of just like remove all the crap and shoehorn it down into one object, it becomes invisible to us.

472
0:36:43.500 --> 0:36:48.500
I'm onto that one next. It becomes invisible to us, right? We can't do anything to it.

473
0:36:48.500 --> 0:36:55.500
We can't help you improve it. It's just like it's just there and it's a mess and it's going to be a mess for the rest of time.

474
0:36:55.500 --> 0:37:00.500
So if you're like, oh, it's lots of problem, tell us it's lots of problematic.

475
0:37:00.500 --> 0:37:03.500
We'll up to my slots for you.

476
0:37:03.500 --> 0:37:09.500
Onto that last question. Is there a better way to move several items and nested folders?

477
0:37:09.500 --> 0:37:15.500
No. Currently, no. Better adventure management is also on our roadmap.

478
0:37:15.500 --> 0:37:20.500
We want to get to the place where it operates more like a sort of Windows file manager or whatever your favorite is,

479
0:37:20.500 --> 0:37:24.500
where you can drag and drop items and move them around and all sorts of stuff like that.

480
0:37:24.500 --> 0:37:28.500
I had a huge rant previous few weeks about how drag and drop is a bad user experience.

481
0:37:28.500 --> 0:37:32.500
Lots of people screamed me. That's totally fine. Drag and drop is terrible, especially in VR.

482
0:37:32.500 --> 0:37:37.500
So there will be some experience that allows you to do the equivalent of drag and dropping.

483
0:37:37.500 --> 0:37:43.500
It may be dragging and dropping. If I get my way or manage to explain to people what I'm talking about instead of just rambling at them,

484
0:37:43.500 --> 0:37:49.500
then there will be opportunities that do not involve the direct drag and dropping mechanism

485
0:37:49.500 --> 0:37:53.500
because it's a terrible experience in VR.

486
0:37:53.500 --> 0:37:56.500
But we will see.

487
0:38:01.500 --> 0:38:05.500
Yes, inventory search is also included in that.

488
0:38:05.500 --> 0:38:09.500
With that, I believe we're out of questions.

489
0:38:09.500 --> 0:38:14.500
If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to drop them into my DMs, et cetera.

490
0:38:14.500 --> 0:38:18.500
And I will get back to you as soon as I can with more office hours.

491
0:38:18.500 --> 0:38:22.500
I expect this to be up on sounder shortly. If you have any questions, like I said, just let me know.
