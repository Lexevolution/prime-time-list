1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
 All right, and we start the recording because we're late.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,640
 Sorry for being late, everyone.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,880
 Welcome to Office Hours.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,740
 I was cognizant of the time up until 10 to,

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,620
 and then I don't know what happened, and it was 16:01.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,080
 So I just didn't get everything done.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,100
 But we're live now.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,240
 I created the thread.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,440
 Welcome to Office Hours.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,280
 If you have any questions, please drop them

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,880
 in the Office Hours text chat thread, which I just made.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,040
 Once again, apologies for the confusion.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,120
 I see people flooding in.

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,880
 That's fantastic.

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,160
 We'll give them a few minutes to flood in,

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,600
 and we'll keep going a few minutes

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
 after due to my tardiness.

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,600
 Remember at school, some teachers would use,

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
 like, you're late, and other teachers

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,560
 would use, like, you're tardy.

21
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,640
 And I always felt like tardy or tardiness was more

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,960
 insultive than saying that I was late,

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,840
 and I don't really know why.

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,680
 It was like, somehow, more insultive.

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,140
 So I have a question from Lex, who

26
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,720
 says, how's the run up to the MMC deadline

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,920
 as an organizer been?

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,640
 It's usually quite OK for me, as Medra usually handles

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,760
 most of the complexities there.

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,360
 We do get a lot of questions which just repeat every year,

31
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,880
 and they kind of amaze me, really,

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,920
 because we haven't changed anything in quite a long time

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
 now.

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,400
 Sometimes we change the categories or the prize amounts,

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,840
 but the general core principles of the rules haven't changed,

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,080
 yet people still seem to be very surprised by them.

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,160
 We often get questions about licenses and things like that.

38
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,800
 I guess this is an opportunity to sort of clear some of that

39
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,880
 up a little bit.

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,320
 We don't decide what can and cannot be used in the MMC.

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,880
 What we decide is only appropriate licensed assets

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,400
 can be used in the MMC.

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,960
 So when you come to us with an asset,

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,880
 and you're like, can we use this?

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,000
 We don't make the determination.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,040
 We read the license which makes that determination.

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,240
 You basically have to learn how to read licenses, which

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,160
 you should be doing all of the time,

49
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,680
 but you really only do for the MMC

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
 if you're not really exposed to them every day.

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,080
 But if you take a look at a license,

52
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,840
 it very clearly will state if you can use it inside the MMC.

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,120
 It doesn't use the words, can be used inside the MMC.

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,560
 What it uses is words such as, you

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,040
 can redistribute these assets.

56
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,120
 You can use these assets commercially.

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,120
 You can use these assets if you credit me, things like that.

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,800
 Those are the words that you need to be looking for.

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,160
 If you read a license and it says, can't be used by Prime,

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,480
 then it's quite clearly that not only can I not

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,560
 use that asset in the MMC, I can't use that asset anywhere.

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,960
 And so that's the distinction.

63
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,720
 We get a lot of people who think that we are the deciders.

64
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,280
 We're not.

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,360
 We just read the license, which then informs us

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,760
 of what the decision is.

67
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,160
 The decision existed before we took a look.

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,640
 So if you can read licenses, you don't need to ask us.

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,480
 It's kind of crazy that that keeps coming up.

70
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,880
 The license says you can use it, provided

71
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
 you can credit people.

72
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,400
 And then people still say, but can we use it in the MMC?

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,440
 And it's like, well, what does the license say?

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,320
 And people go, don't know, because they don't read them.

75
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,400
 Or sometimes they're very long and complicated.

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
 And we all understand that.

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
 And so we'll always answer for you.

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
 But I want to, again, make that distinction clear.

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
 We don't make the decision.

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,440
 The license makes the decision.

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,720
 And that's why it's so important to not use any assets

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,560
 that you don't have licenses to, or if it's unclear,

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,000
 and the safest option being, don't use it.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,720
 I guess we'll keep going.

85
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,220
 If there's any other questions, though,

86
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,640
 I'd love to go through them.

87
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,140
 Oh, yeah.

88
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,280
 This is another one from MMC.

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,680
 Is there anything new you've learned from the MMC

90
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,420
 submissions so far, assuming you've seen some?

91
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,260
 I actually haven't had a chance to see some.

92
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,280
 I've been a bit busy over the past couple of days,

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,600
 mostly with headaches and weird medical-related issues.

94
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,840
 I had a blood draw yesterday.

95
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,260
 It had to be a fasting one, which is why you can't eat.

96
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,180
 And it wiped me out for the entire day.

97
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,240
 And I don't know why.

98
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,320
 It was only three vials.

99
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,580
 I have no idea why.

100
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,280
 I've had six, seven, eight vials sometimes taken.

101
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,340
 But these three vials, and I had to not eat before them.

102
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,120
 And I immediately found food afterwards.

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,920
 I got straight back on the bus home, got into the kitchen,

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,680
 and devoured anything I could find.

105
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,060
 But still, I was tired.

106
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,820
 And the only thing I can think of is a whole combination

107
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,500
 of events--

108
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,260
 don't eat, take blood, travel, whatever, wipe me out.

109
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,360
 And then I had a headache for the entire night as well.

110
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,120
 And the blood work came back.

111
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,760
 And I'm not allowed to take any painkillers for a month

112
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,260
 to test some results of that blood work.

113
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,360
 And so I'm like, cool, guess I'll die.

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,740
 So I just rolled around in bed.

115
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,760
 Hey, there's these amazing--

116
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,620
 I'm going to get everyone the link to them.

117
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,860
 If you get bad headaches sometimes,

118
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,020
 you need to get these.

119
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,820
 Let's see if I can find them.

120
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,440
 There's a particular brand I use.

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,280
 Yeah, here they are.

122
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,320
 They've got a cool 1990s name.

123
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,900
 Here they are.

124
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,880
 I've dropped them in the thread.

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,060
 I have four boxes of these, so I never run out.

126
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,580
 And they're worth every penny.

127
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,260
 That's a pack of nine for $30.

128
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,180
 That's good.

129
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,520
 I usually just buy one.

130
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,180
 They're just cooling gel patches.

131
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,800
 You can do the same really with ice.

132
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,760
 But the problem I have with ice is I never

133
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,720
 remember to freeze it.

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,700
 I've got a reasonable quality ice pack that's basically

135
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,320
 what looks like Orbeez in a plastic bag,

136
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,880
 and even a Valkyrie thing.

137
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,680
 I got that when I went to the dentist once.

138
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,640
 I just never remember to put it in the freezer.

139
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,300
 Whereas those are ready to go anytime,

140
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,660
 and they're quite portable.

141
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,640
 I got a set in my travel bag as well.

142
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,300
 So wherever I am in the world, I've got a set of those handy.

143
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,240
 There's always gel and stuff like that.

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,960
 Lots of times it looks like a sort

145
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,520
 of deodorant with a rollerball.

146
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,280
 But I don't think they work as well as those gel sheets.

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,600
 I don't particularly know why.

148
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,020
 Gross thing about those gel sheets

149
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,760
 is you roll over in the middle of the night,

150
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,120
 and it falls off.

151
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,680
 And then you wake up, and it's stuck to the side of your face

152
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,100
 because it's moved from your forehead, and you're just like,

153
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,060
 ew.

154
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,240
 But hey, it did its job.

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,360
 Moving forwards, is this to-do going to be fulfilled?

156
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,780
 So this is a to-do based on the Nenas voting server.

157
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,600
 Yeah, so lots of people have said, yo,

158
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,880
 I'm going to use mods and save the voting server

159
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,180
 so I can see how it works.

160
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,680
 And I'm like, you know the voting server's open source,

161
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,920
 and I'm happy that you're interested in it,

162
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,760
 but maybe be interested in it not in the official voting

163
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
 world, maybe ask about it otherwise,

164
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,900
 and I can just give you a look or give you a tour.

165
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,360
 Don't mess with the actual vote.

166
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,680
 So the to-do that Lex is pointing to

167
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,320
 is a to-do in a new system I added for 2022

168
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,680
 where I stored the entry name.

169
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
 So when the result sheet is generated

170
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,920
 using some of the parts of that GitHub repo,

171
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,760
 it used to be generated with just the record ID, which

172
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,200
 got really confusing when people did more than one entries,

173
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,160
 and we kind of had to do it manually.

174
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,400
 And we got tired of doing that, so I

175
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 wrote a system that would look at doing it for storing

176
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,640
 the actual entry name.

177
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,080
 But then lots of entries decided they wanted to use RTF tags,

178
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
 so that each letter in their entry,

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,400
 it was like a different color.

180
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,440
 I'm reminded of the early days of MSN

181
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,280
 where you installed so many custom emojis that the sentence

182
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,960
 hello, how are you turned into like a Marvel film length

183
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,840
 sequence of animated emojis.

184
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,920
 Those were the days of MSN.

185
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,680
 So that's why that to-do is there.

186
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,840
 I don't know if it will be resolved.

187
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,560
 I kind of wait until the MMC is over

188
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,480
 before I get the voting going, because voting is like--

189
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,600
 it's not immediately afterwards.

190
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,840
 It's not immediately afterwards, so there is some time.

191
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,600
 That lets me set everything up.

192
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,160
 It's also easier to set everything up

193
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,480
 once we have a list of entries.

194
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,780
 So we can take a look at all the categories working

195
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,620
 and everything.

196
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,440
 So I don't know.

197
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,600
 It didn't affect us that much, because only one or two entries

198
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,760
 had the RTF tags.

199
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,640
 And so we just was like, oh, it's the RTF tag entry

200
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,500
 by this person.

201
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,800
 And then we knew what it was.

202
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,100
 But if every entry had RTF tags, it

203
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,040
 would be a nightmare to go through the results sheet.

204
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,240
 Ozzy asks, has the GitHub bot been down for a fair bit?

205
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
 It has been down for a fair bit.

206
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,580
 It's low priority, because we're not really doing that much.

207
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,840
 It's also weird, because every time we do something minor,

208
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,800
 people go like, oh, oh, oh, oh, is this Big Update Marketplace?

209
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,320
 It's like, no, I merged a locale PR,

210
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,420
 because I felt bad about the people that

211
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,540
 have translated the entire game into a different language

212
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,880
 that we don't support yet.

213
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,560
 And they haven't seen anything for two years,

214
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,660
 and there's absolutely nothing wrong with their PR.

215
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,200
 And if we leave it open, we'll just forget.

216
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,400
 So I might as well merge it.

217
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,460
 And that way, when we do resume updates,

218
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,160
 we'll get that translation in.

219
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,620
 And people are like, does this mean Big Update Marketplace?

220
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,700
 I'm like, it just means that I am just merging a PR.

221
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,380
 It doesn't mean anything.

222
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,920
 People are way too quick to put intention and behavior

223
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,500
 around small activities.

224
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,760
 I feel like if people desired, I mean,

225
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,800
 we'd probably see if we could get a restraining order

226
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,620
 or something.

227
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,720
 But they'll be camping outside our houses

228
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,540
 and with telescopes into our window.

229
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,260
 And they'll be like, [GASP] Prime touched his keyboard.

230
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,020
 Does that mean Big Update Marketplace?

231
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,120
 It's like, nah, man.

232
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,560
 That's just me ordering another cheese pizza.

233
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
 Which reminds me, I want cheesy garlic bread.

234
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,600
 And I want the biggest cheesy garlic bread

235
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,760
 that can be given to me.

236
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,640
 My local grocery store is a Trader Joe's,

237
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,160
 which is renowned for hipster-style food.

238
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,240
 And their selection is always less than a larger grocery

239
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,600
 store because of that.

240
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
 There is a larger grocery store a little bit further away

241
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,680
 from me, but I can never be bothered

242
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,080
 to walk that extra 10 minutes to get there.

243
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,920
 But I went to that Trader Joe's yesterday,

244
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,920
 and I was looking for the biggest garlic cheese mess.

245
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,520
 I didn't care how big it was, how fattening it was.

246
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,480
 I just wanted garlic and cheese and carbohydrates.

247
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,320
 And I couldn't find any, so I was very sad.

248
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,560
 For those who are like, you can order online, it's like,

249
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,160
 have you seen the prices for online ordering of pizza-related

250
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,080
 goods these days?

251
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,120
 I'm like, I would like a single large garlic bread thing.

252
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
 And they're like, please give us $30.

253
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,040
 I'm like, what?

254
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,000
 That doesn't make any sense.

255
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,560
 I was filling in some, I think it was tax forms the other day.

256
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,160
 And I needed an address from when I lived in the UK.

257
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,320
 So I knew the street name.

258
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,520
 So I just typed the street name into my email.

259
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,400
 And I found the full address by looking for a delivery food

260
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,160
 order from the UK.

261
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,400
 And it was ridiculous.

262
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
 It was something like two pizzas, blah, blah, blah, blah,

263
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,120
 all this stuff.

264
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,880
 And it was like less than $30.

265
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,200
 And I'm like, how?

266
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,840
 It was a lot of food, and it was very cheap.

267
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,320
 And I'm just like, how?

268
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,520
 Like, what planet was that?

269
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,120
 And then I looked at the year, and it was like,

270
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,920
 I don't think like 2013 or something.

271
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,440
 And I'm just like, ah, that's why.

272
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,400
 Ozzy asks about if there are any headsets I'm looking forward

273
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,920
 to.

274
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,520
 I am actually looking forward to that big screen headset.

275
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,960
 The reason is just like, the more I think about it,

276
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,920
 the more I realize it is the weight that is bothering me.

277
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
 It is, of course, the lack of features as well.

278
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,080
 The lack of face tracking, the lack of eye tracking

279
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,840
 does bother me sometimes.

280
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,720
 But mostly what I want is a lightweight headset

281
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,960
 that doesn't fall apart.

282
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,680
 And that also includes the controllers,

283
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,640
 because you know what index controllers are like.

284
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,520
 The current ones I'm using are battered.

285
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,680
 They are very battered.

286
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,960
 I think the capacitive touch on the joystick is going,

287
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
 but they're not drifting yet.

288
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,360
 So I still use them, because the joystick drift

289
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,280
 hasn't happened yet.

290
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,880
 So there's no reason to sort of change them over.

291
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,080
 The capacitive is done on the joystick, though.

292
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,880
 I do have a fresh set that are unused.

293
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,440
 I think I used them for like an hour,

294
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,720
 just to make sure they work.

295
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,120
 They're in my cupboard.

296
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,960
 And I will switch to those at the moment,

297
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,480
 like really bad joystick drifts sets in on those.

298
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
 When I say battered, like you know

299
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,360
 the curve of the outside of the top?

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
 There's like a curve there.

301
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,840
 It's quite a sharp curve.

302
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,240
 That's been like rubbed away.

303
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,280
 And I can see like--

304
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,640
 it's just-- it looks like someone's

305
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,400
 taking sandpaper around all of the edges

306
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,800
 of the current controllers.

307
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,840
 I don't remember how much the big screen weighs,

308
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,720
 but I think it's like a third less or something like that,

309
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,640
 or 2/3 less.

310
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,040
 It's a big, big, big decrease in weight.

311
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,160
 You don't realize how much weight is the problem,

312
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,040
 but it is there.

313
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
 I've always wondered why they're so weighty.

314
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
 Like I don't know why more of the processing

315
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,640
 isn't at the other end of the cable.

316
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,000
 When you remember the original Vive had that link box.

317
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,280
 It's like, why?

318
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,880
 Why?

319
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,760
 Look at any other system.

320
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,960
 A monitor, for example.

321
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,920
 Monitors are quite thin these days.

322
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,080
 They're connected to a beast of a computer,

323
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,640
 but the monitor is quite thin.

324
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,560
 So why is the thing that I strap to my face like really chunky

325
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,080
 and heavy?

326
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,560
 I don't understand.

327
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,600
 Yeah, there's position tracking and stuff like that,

328
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 but why is that chunky?

329
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,240
 I don't understand.

330
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,960
 Anyway, so we'll see how that controller works.

331
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
 Charlie-san, you're in the wrong thread.

332
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,920
 I will go into the old thread and take a look,

333
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,240
 but you are in the moderation office thread.

334
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,960
 Link asks, did I order the ITI controllers a long time ago?

335
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,440
 Yes.

336
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,560
 I'm actually going to go look that up.

337
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,280
 We've got time.

338
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,480
 Questions levels are a little bit lower.

339
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,520
 I want to just find out when I ordered those controllers,

340
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,080
 because it's getting ridiculous.

341
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,320
 Although, once I find that day, I

342
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,880
 do admire what the community manager just did.

343
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,600
 I'll talk about that once I get the date.

344
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,120
 Gmail has logged me out for the 20th time this week.

345
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,720
 And to log in, I need to pretty much sacrifice a goat.

346
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,200
 Yeah, the order was 2021.

347
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,560
 March 2021 was when I ordered the ITI controllers.

348
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,000
 So what's happening there is they've repeatedly

349
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 said that they were--

350
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 sorry, excuse me-- that they were

351
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,200
 going to be delivering those.

352
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,240
 And then sort of accidentally fallen back on their promises.

353
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
 So it was going to be before the end of the year,

354
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,120
 or the community manager said that they were

355
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,600
 going to eat an ITI controller.

356
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,440
 They didn't actually eat an ITI controller.

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,520
 I even gave them outs.

358
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,760
 Like, I DM'd them, and I was like,

359
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,520
 you could just contact one of those realistic cake makers

360
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,040
 to make you an ITI controller.

361
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,680
 It'd be a great marketing beat.

362
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,120
 And then you eat it on stream.

363
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,320
 It would be hilarious, but they didn't actually do that.

364
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,280
 They did write a support article on the official ITI support

365
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,360
 system, which talks about the safety of eating a controller

366
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,000
 and goes through all the chemicals and materials that

367
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,440
 make up an ITI controller, which again, I thought was great.

368
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,280
 Again, another sort of good marketing thing.

369
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
 But seriously, guys, just make an ITI cake

370
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,080
 and eat it on stream.

371
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,200
 All of the late they're taking a long time to ship

372
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
 will be forgiven if you do that.

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,880
 Just eat a cake on stream that looks like your controllers.

374
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,840
 But anyway, what I mean by the community manager doing good

375
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,600
 is they've actually updated the shipping estimate to be

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,840
 approximately February and March.

377
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,160
 They didn't give an exact date.

378
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,560
 So instead of saying, by the end of the year,

379
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,880
 they said approximately again.

380
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,280
 So they didn't give an exact date.

381
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,080
 I love that.

382
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 It's good.

383
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,840
 It means that they've recognized that there is a problem

384
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,400
 and they need to address that problem by continuing

385
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,680
 to not make assurances and instead give vague stuff.

386
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,440
 It's weird that I'm happy with vague,

387
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,040
 but it basically means I'm not waiting.

388
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,320
 I'm not clock watching.

389
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,080
 Because before Christmas, I was clock

390
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,480
 watching all the way through Christmas.

391
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,080
 I'm like, the shipping in December,

392
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,440
 so I was checking my emails.

393
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,560
 I mean, not actively, but I mean, it was in my brain.

394
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,080
 The thought piece of maybe the empty controllers

395
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
 will be shipping to me.

396
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,440
 But now it's like approximately February, March.

397
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,520
 I don't need to-- it's not part of my brain right now.

398
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,440
 Moving on, Rapper says, do I have a fruity phone?

399
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,840
 Apparently, I need a fruity phone for the big screen thing.

400
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,920
 I would just find someone that's got a big chunky phone

401
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,080
 if mine's not supported.

402
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,560
 I do have a Pixel 7 Pro that has got more lenses on the back

403
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,720
 of it than I know what they are.

404
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,440
 But I don't think that's a word.

405
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
 I think it needs to be an Apple iPhone.

406
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,480
 It needs to be a particular type of-- it's

407
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,040
 one of the LIDAR phones.

408
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,520
 It's fine.

409
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,480
 I'll figure it out.

410
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,640
 I'll just be like, yo, friend, you got an iPhone?

411
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,320
 Cool.

412
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,840
 Yo, foe, yeah, you got an iPhone?

413
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 Great, thank you.

414
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,920
 I believe we're at the end of questions there.

415
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,120
 I don't think I've missed any.

416
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,920
 I will scroll up.

417
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,120
 Oh, no, I'll have to look in the moderation thread for do you

418
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
 believe you.

419
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
 So Charlie sent in the wrong thread,

420
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,120
 but I let them know previously.

421
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,320
 If you want a good lightweight pair of headphones,

422
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,880
 try the still serious Arctis 3s.

423
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,720
 I actually don't have a problem with headphones.

424
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,800
 I've had a Bose QC35 since roughly 2016.

425
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,920
 I love them.

426
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,720
 With the idea that they die, I will immediately

427
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,160
 purchase another pair of Bose QC35s,

428
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,120
 because they are amazing headphones.

429
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,400
 I don't use the index's on-ear headphones.

430
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
 I immediately unscrewed those.

431
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,680
 For those who don't know, it's just a small screw,

432
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,720
 and then they pop off.

433
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
 And then I use QC35s.

434
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,520
 I found that the on-ear headphones leaked audio

435
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,920
 into the microphone for the index,

436
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,720
 whereas using the QC35s doesn't.

437
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,400
 And I just can't stand leaked audio.

438
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,520
 If I notice leaked audio from myself,

439
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,760
 I will mute myself immediately in whatever voice channel it is,

440
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,680
 and then spend the next 20 hours fixing it,

441
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,200
 because it's just personal gripe of mine.

442
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,960
 Sorta's talking about the edible stuff

443
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,000
 they use to make things look realistic.

444
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,440
 And they said that Raval almost need natural controller.

445
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,000
 You're right.

446
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,520
 They usually use fondant for those cakes.

447
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,920
 And it's gross.

448
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,240
 Fondant is-- in large quantities, it's gross.

449
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,960
 The problem with those realistic cakes is a lot of times,

450
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,840
 they have to make up a bulk, or some of the sculptures,

451
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,120
 or some edges, or something with fondant, which

452
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,440
 is basically like sugar clay.

453
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,880
 And it doesn't taste very nice.

454
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,400
 But the point about a cake, for me at least,

455
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,600
 is that it has to actually be cake in it.

456
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,120
 But with those realistic cakes, it's

457
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,960
 a lot of just fondant painting.

458
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,040
 It's still a skill, and they're still great,

459
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,360
 but you don't want to eat them.

460
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
 I guess it's also like--

461
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,360
 I don't know if people will have this sort of memory.

462
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,640
 But growing up when you had birthday cakes,

463
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,520
 you might have had one of those ones that had--

464
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,840
 it's just a generic white cake that's been iced.

465
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,560
 But it had balloons that were put on top of it.

466
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,680
 Those balloons were usually fondant.

467
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,280
 And I would always, as a kid, I was like, cool.

468
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,120
 I want a piece that's got one of the balloons on it.

469
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,440
 But the balloon was basically just taking the icing

470
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,120
 and doubling the thickness of the icing,

471
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,240
 because it was on top of the regular icing, which

472
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,960
 meant the fondant layer was double.

473
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,760
 And as a kid, I quickly realized that wasn't a good idea.

474
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,240
 I'm like, I want a middle piece as far away from the balloons

475
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
 as possible.

476
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
 I just searched like, "perfect cake" on Google Images,

477
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,160
 and I can't find the stereotypical balloons

478
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
 I'm talking about.

479
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,720
 There's also ones where the balloons are printed,

480
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,540
 but the ones I used to get from the bakery by my family

481
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,640
 were always fondant balloons in the corners and stuff

482
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,000
 like that.

483
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,320
 Sort of was trying to forget the fondant balloons.

484
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,800
 Yep.

485
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,080
 No, I remember them.

486
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 I remember one time I had a chocolate cake.

487
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,160
 People are saying they don't like chocolate cake.

488
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,120
 It's like they wanted carrot cake for their birthdays.

489
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,520
 They can't stand chocolate.

490
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,160
 Yeah, I like cakes that are not as iced as they need to be.

491
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,320
 Or different types of icing.

492
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,560
 There are multiple different types of icing.

493
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,080
 Here you go.

494
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,600
 It's like this sort of thing.

495
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,720
 It's like the balloons are just like triple or double

496
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,000
 the thickness of the regular icing.

497
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,480
 Got any more near-us questions?

498
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,760
 Or we're just going to end up talking about cake

499
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,820
 for another five minutes?

500
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,160
 I just missed a call.

501
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,400
 I don't know who that is.

502
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,660
 If I don't know the number, I literally

503
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,080
 won't answer the phone these days.

504
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,920
 It's just like, cool.

505
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,080
 There's one above I missed.

506
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,960
 Oh, I got it.

507
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,640
 Yes, thank you.

508
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,500
 Thank you for pointing that out.

509
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,240
 Specs, I'm sorry I missed your question.

510
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,320
 Specs says, our MMC entry is going to be submitted.

511
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,660
 We're going to work on a dev branch copy for future updates

512
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,480
 after judgment.

513
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,060
 How can one overwrite a published world

514
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,560
 with a different separate version for the future?

515
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,100
 You shouldn't do that.

516
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,800
 You should leave the MMC one as the MMC one

517
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,680
 and then produce a version two.

518
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,140
 Or at least that's the preference that we have.

519
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,300
 The goal is to sort of preserve a moment in time

520
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,140
 of what you achieved in a month.

521
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,100
 And then if you need to expand on that work,

522
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,540
 make it a separate copy.

523
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,480
 They also do that with the credit jam worlds.

524
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,960
 They will save the credit jam world

525
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,940
 at the end of the credit jam.

526
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,980
 That is what they achieved in that weekend.

527
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,900
 And then they'll create like a remix world, which is

528
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
 where they then expand on that.

529
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,500
 Mamie asks, how many MMC submissions

530
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,620
 have been published so far?

531
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,640
 Lex answers with 101.

532
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,740
 We know that there isn't the like facet

533
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,500
 on the side of the world browser updated yet.

534
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,940
 But if you go ahead and you just search for--

535
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,860
 no, wait, that's last year.

536
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,880
 If you put plus MMC 23 into your world browser search bar,

537
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,940
 it will restrict your entries to anything

538
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,620
 which is appropriately tagged.

539
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,980
 By the way, that's the whole reason that the MMC tag needs

540
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,820
 to be in there exactly as we specify it.

541
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,300
 It's so that that particular search works.

542
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,020
 Because that's the search that the judges use and also

543
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,180
 that the voting system uses to find your entry.

544
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,660
 And so if you put, I don't know, MMC 28,

545
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,540
 we're not going to be able to find it until 2028.

546
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,720
 Rade says, I saw a couple of worlds that had quotations

547
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
 like MMC 23.

548
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,220
 Yeah, Medra needs to do that.

549
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,580
 They need to remove the quotations from the tags.

550
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,360
 They should still show up correctly

551
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,860
 because we strip punctuation in some places.

552
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,900
 But it needs to be plus MMC 23.

553
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,440
 What that means when you do plus MMC 23 is the search result

554
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,340
 must contain the tag MMC 23.

555
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,620
 That's what the plus means.

556
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,900
 And that's just how we do it.

557
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,200
 And then the tags there are used for bucketing entries

558
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,620
 into the various categories we've got

559
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,260
 and also for bucketing them into the list.

560
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,420
 So make sure they're correct.

561
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,780
 If you're not sure, you'll be able to check the voting

562
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,900
 system once it's live.

563
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,620
 Which, of course, it'll be too late then.

564
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,660
 So maybe check the world browser before that.

565
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,260
 But yeah.

566
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,580
 Rampa says, can't we just run a script that force fix

567
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,260
 his tags on the backend?

568
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,140
 No.

569
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,940
 Because the MMC is not a Neos competition.

570
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,300
 The MMC is made by a third party company called CreatorJam.

571
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,640
 And so while Neos the team does a lot of stuff

572
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,780
 to help out the MMC, we have to put a limit on that.

573
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,740
 And so the limit that we kind of put is,

574
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,060
 let's not do anything special for the MMC.

575
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,420
 Let's not do anything in addition for that.

576
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,940
 Of course, the world browser button is an exception,

577
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,460
 of course.

578
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,180
 But what we don't want to get into the habit of

579
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,340
 is for this company or this third party event,

580
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,660
 we do special stuff.

581
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,860
 And then for this third party company or thing,

582
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,140
 we don't do special stuff.

583
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,740
 Because that just gets problematic.

584
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,100
 That's why other platforms will, in some cases,

585
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,780
 like charge for additional features.

586
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,620
 So they're trying to sort of make it a level playing field.

587
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,660
 It's weird.

588
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,420
 It basically just sort of sets up expectations.

589
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,380
 If we did a bunch of custom work for the MMC,

590
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,700
 then we should also do that bunch of custom work

591
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,900
 for any other event that exists.

592
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,300
 Yeah, and if your tags are wrong,

593
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,180
 it's actually on you.

594
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,220
 It's not on us.

595
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,740
 It's entirely your fault. You have a month

596
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,220
 to submit your entry and to double check it

597
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,020
 and to ask us if you're unsure.

598
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,140
 Moving forward to additional questions that we have,

599
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,220
 Riggs says, will they be dragging into folders

600
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,580
 in the future?

601
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,460
 I think yes.

602
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,940
 You can take a look at our roadmap boards.

603
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,380
 I don't remember which roadmap board it's on.

604
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,860
 But one of the roadmap boards there

605
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,780
 will have better--

606
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,660
 Neos Public Crunchings.

607
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,980
 Crunchings Classic.

608
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,100
 There we go.

609
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
 One of those has an item for updating the file browser.

610
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,460
 It also has things for dark mode.

611
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,420
 It also has things for better UI, more tutorials,

612
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,860
 more documentation, et cetera.

613
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,300
 Whilst you're waiting for that, I

614
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,180
 do want you to take just a little bit of time,

615
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,820
 especially if you're a Logix developer

616
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,500
 or you make anything inside of Neos,

617
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,820
 just imagine how difficult it is to make an inventory system

618
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,660
 where you are able to do that.

619
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,180
 Take for granted the fact that it even works on Windows.

620
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,180
 It is a very complicated problem.

621
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,500
 I want to eventually get the world browser to a state

622
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,140
 where it's similar and not identical to-- so just

623
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,060
 hear the word similar.

624
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,980
 Don't quote me as being identical to--

625
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,500
 similar to things like the Twitch front page or the Steam

626
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,420
 store front page, where it's not really even up

627
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,980
 to engineering what goes on there.

628
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,140
 Engineering, of course, have made sort of squares.

629
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,340
 And the squares have different functionality,

630
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,260
 but it's up to sort of like a marketing team or a marketing

631
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,380
 person to decide what goes on there.

632
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,020
 I know that's how it works, because I

633
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,420
 used to work for Mixer, and that's

634
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,220
 how we made the front page on Mixer works.

635
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,900
 Basically, we were like, cool, you want a featured category.

636
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,580
 It's in a featured game box.

637
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,060
 Cool.

638
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,540
 We have made that box for you.

639
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,740
 What is in that box?

640
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,300
 When that box appears, when that box disappears,

641
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,820
 it is entirely up to you.

642
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,140
 Don't ask us about it.

643
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,220
 Here's how you do it.

644
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,700
 If you have any difficulty using the tooling, we can help you.

645
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,860
 But it's not up to us which games get featured.

646
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,300
 And that's what I wanted to do.

647
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,820
 I also want to get to the point where

648
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,100
 we don't have to do an update to update that.

649
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,580
 Say we wanted to do Thursdays at 3 o'clock,

650
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,980
 we showcase cheese worlds with a cheese world banner.

651
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,420
 Then great, that just happens.

652
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,300
 We don't need to do a code update for that.

653
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,980
 I don't know how world overwrites works,

654
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,140
 actually, unfortunately.

655
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,900
 There is a bug open that says that world overwrites don't

656
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,220
 work, but they do.

657
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,540
 I think I made an update on that when I figured out

658
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,460
 how it worked.

659
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,020
 But then I still think that was a bug.

660
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,900
 And so I haven't actually used it successfully,

661
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,820
 so I don't know.

662
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,340
 There we go.

663
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,700
 So Ozzy can tell you how.

664
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,540
 It's all on you.

665
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,820
 All the fingers now point to Ozzy.

666
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,420
 All of them.

667
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,020
 I was thinking for world paths, I

668
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,700
 went on a three hour expedition into the source code

669
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,740
 to figure out world paths.

670
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,100
 Couldn't figure it out.

671
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,380
 Asked Fruks, he gave me an answer that I didn't understand.

672
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,060
 And so I need to go back to Fruks and ask,

673
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,540
 but I haven't done that yet.

674
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,540
 Yeah, that's pretty much what's going on.

675
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,620
 Same with cloud variables.

676
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,340
 You'll notice on the cloud variable documentation,

677
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,660
 there's a bunch of sort of like--

678
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,700
 Prime doesn't know what's going on here,

679
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,140
 because Prime kept making mistakes

680
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,260
 in the documentation there.

681
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,820
 Speaking about myself and third person's weird,

682
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,900
 but you know what I mean.

683
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,900
 I kept making mistakes on how cloud variables worked.

684
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,540
 And so I just blanked out some of them.

685
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,300
 And I'm like, look, I've got to look at these later.

686
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,860
 If people want to look at them and figure them out,

687
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,540
 they're free to update the documentation.

688
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,420
 But there we go.

689
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,380
 Also, that reminds me, for anyone here,

690
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,220
 cloud variables are fine.

691
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,260
 We had someone in another one of the Discords

692
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,060
 here that said they were told to avoid cloud variables

693
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,140
 for some reason because they were quote "bad" or something.

694
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,060
 They're fine.

695
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,140
 Use them.

696
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,300
 And for anyone here that has been telling other people

697
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,660
 that various features are bad for some reason, stop it.

698
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,300
 Stop.

699
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,580
 People are like, logics is bad.

700
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,260
 Stop.

701
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,900
 Components are-- stop.

702
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,220
 Yeah, it's really weird.

703
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,300
 It's like-- a lot of people say--

704
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,260
 like I said, a lot of people say use components, not logic.

705
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,180
 But then, I'm like, logic is components.

706
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,820
 And then the whole reality is shattered.

707
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,100
 Just use whatever works for you.

708
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,500
 I'm tired of reading, like, is there a component

709
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,700
 to add two numbers together?

710
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,780
 Yes, the plus node in logics.

711
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,380
 Also, use the sort of principle of pack often, pack early,

712
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,020
 when it comes to that, stuff like that.

713
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,060
 People go like, but they're not have

714
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,580
 to get logic, sir, and stuff like that

715
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,740
 to add two numbers together.

716
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,300
 Yeah, do it.

717
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,260
 Make a two node chain that adds two numbers together.

718
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,700
 Pack it into the same slot those components are on.

719
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,200
 You're done.

720
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,060
 You never have to unpack that logic again.

721
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,940
 I do it all the time.

722
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,820
 I even have logics that purely updates properties

723
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,780
 on components because I'm lazy.

724
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,140
 One that I'll often do is something

725
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,660
 along the lines of the slot name drives the variable

726
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,940
 name of a dynamic variable.

727
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,380
 So let's say you had a dynamic variable prefix of world,

728
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,580
 because you're using the world dynamic variable space

729
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,100
 like that.

730
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,620
 And then you make a slot called cheese.

731
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,620
 I then sometimes have on that cheese slot,

732
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,540
 I've got like a dynamic variable value.

733
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,220
 And for the variable name, I just

734
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,500
 do world plus slot name in logics.

735
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,860
 And then it's like, cool.

736
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,580
 Now, whatever I name this slot, wherever I put this slot,

737
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,020
 it just works.

738
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,300
 Anyway, I'm tired of ranting about that one,

739
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,740
 but basically, just stop telling people not to use features.

740
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,100
 Like if there is a feature that we shouldn't be using,

741
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,260
 put it in the announcements.

742
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,780
 There is the things to avoid list,

743
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,020
 but that's things to avoid.

744
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,700
 And the way you need to think about that

745
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,540
 is doctors will tell you to avoid alcohol,

746
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,540
 to avoid eating giant cheese garlic breads that I'm still

747
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,980
 going to try and find today.

748
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,420
 They'll tell you to avoid too much caffeine,

749
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,300
 avoid too much sugar, but you're still going to eat the cake.

750
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,460
 So it's things to avoid because it's like, hey, I'm Dr. Prime.

751
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,220
 And I say, for your health, you should avoid these things.

752
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,740
 But they do taste good.

753
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,100
 They do taste good.

754
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,540
 Rick says, what foods do I avoid?

755
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,300
 Bread, strangely.

756
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,980
 There's this video and principle--

757
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,380
 this is getting way off the weeds.

758
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,700
 We'll close in just a moment.

759
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,820
 But there's this thing called changing your behavior

760
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,540
 by changing your environment.

761
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,700
 And it's more effective than just changing your behavior.

762
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,500
 For example, if you need to go to the gym

763
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,860
 but you keep not being able to go to the gym,

764
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,020
 you put your alarm clock on top of your gym bag, which

765
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,580
 is packed and ready to go.

766
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,500
 And then to turn off your alarm, you

767
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,900
 have to touch your gym bag.

768
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,300
 And then you've already got your gym bag in your hands.

769
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,780
 And so you've changed your behavior

770
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,140
 by changing your environment.

771
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,760
 You've got everything ready, and you've

772
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,180
 given yourself an environment that

773
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,980
 condenses going to the gym.

774
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,300
 I do that a lot with food.

775
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,140
 So if I buy a loaf of bread, I know

776
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
 I'm going to find excuses to eat it.

777
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,180
 It will go as far as I will just eat bread plain.

778
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,800
 There doesn't need to be anything on it.

779
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,460
 I will just eat it so I don't buy bread.

780
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,080
 And therefore, I can't eat it because it's not in the house.

781
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,740
 I did an experiment because it's been a few years

782
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,020
 since I bought a loaf of bread.

783
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,180
 I bought a loaf of bread.

784
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,040
 I bought it home.

785
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,900
 It lasted half a day, an entire loaf.

786
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,860
 I would smear things on it.

787
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,140
 I ran out of butter, and so I went to mayonnaise.

788
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,620
 I ran out of mayonnaise, and so I just smeared ketchup on it

789
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,860
 and ate it.

790
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,940
 Whatever is there, I will put it on the bread.

791
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,580
 And if there's nothing on the bread available,

792
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,700
 I'll just eat the bread.

793
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,020
 Sort of just talking about alarms

794
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,520
 and how that doesn't work in theory.

795
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,100
 I now have this amazing thing where

796
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,660
 I have to scan NFC tags for my alarm to stop,

797
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,920
 and I can't stop it until these NFC tags are stopped.

798
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,780
 Now, one of them is in the bathroom,

799
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,780
 and one of them is on top of my water jug, which

800
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,440
 is in the fridge.

801
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,900
 It's a Brita water filter.

802
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,860
 And so until I scan both of those,

803
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,980
 the alarm just will not turn off.

804
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,740
 The bathroom one was to sort of encourage

805
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,620
 me to get out of the bedroom.

806
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,620
 But the water one is like, hey, you've

807
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,020
 got your hand on the water jug.

808
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,660
 You might as well pour a glass.

809
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,560
 And sometimes I'll leave a fresh glass next to the fridge

810
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,220
 as well.

811
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,860
 And then I have zero excuse to not just pound a pint of water.

812
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,180
 But there we go.

813
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,220
 Try that if you've got NFC chips lying around.

814
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,920
 I used to do programming with NFC chips.

815
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,660
 Long story.

816
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,360
 Something to do with motors-- fine.

817
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,020
 I'll just carry on.

818
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,740
 I used to work for a motorsports company.

819
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,900
 We wanted to do technical screening of motorcycles,

820
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,780
 but people kept pulling fast ones on us

821
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,820
 where they would change which motorcycle was being presented

822
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,540
 for their inspection.

823
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,420
 And because it's a race bike, we can't even

824
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,300
 do things like plates, like number plates,

825
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,020
 because number plates.

826
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,980
 I will go through the questions in just a moment,

827
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,700
 but I'm halfway through the story.

828
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,180
 And then we said, well, we could do VIN numbers.

829
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,140
 I hate when people say VIN numbers, because they're saying

830
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,740
 number number.

831
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,500
 But anyway, we could do VIN numbers,

832
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,740
 but VIN numbers are usually really small and difficult

833
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,620
 to read.

834
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,580
 So the way that we did it is we just

835
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,920
 bought NFC chips that destroyed themselves

836
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,940
 when they were removed.

837
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,500
 And they got stuck to a part of the bike.

838
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,780
 They were branded to the motorsports organization.

839
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,660
 I wrote code for an Android smartphone application, which

840
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,460
 would write the vehicle's identification number to it

841
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,220
 and then lock the tag so it couldn't be manipulated.

842
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,460
 And there we go.

843
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,300
 And it was great.

844
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:06,080
 So in developing that, I have like 100 or so NFC tags left.

845
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,540
 I think there's a bag somewhere with like 500 in them,

846
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,780
 but I don't know where that is.

847
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,220
 I've got 100 of easy access ones.

848
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,820
 So that's why they're just like all around my apartment.

849
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,060
 Anyway, I'm going to go back to questions,

850
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,220
 and then we will leave off.

851
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,060
 We'll try and stay on topic.

852
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,460
 No more cakes, no more motorcycles, no more bread.

853
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,620
 So just scrolling up to make sure I'm not

854
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,100
 missing any questions.

855
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,080
 Lex says, is anything going to happen with Neos'

856
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,140
 coffee in the future?

857
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,540
 Or coffee, as I sometimes say it,

858
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,300
 so people don't get confused.

859
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
 Coffee is another funding source that we have where

860
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,000
 you can do a one-time donation.

861
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,920
 We were going to hook it up so that it made sugar cubes.

862
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,700
 I don't remember-- the sugar cube thing

863
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,860
 is the whole before my time.

864
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,380
 But it was meant to be that if you did a coffee donation,

865
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,780
 you would then get some sugar cubes.

866
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,320
 When I was new to Neos, I thought

867
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,280
 that donating via coffee was the thing that

868
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,940
 got you the coffee badge.

869
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,080
 And so I donated using coffee to Neos

870
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,380
 to see if it would give me the coffee badge, and it doesn't.

871
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,660
 But I only gave them like $5, so it's fine.

872
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,980
 And back then, it was--

873
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,300
 I wasn't even on the team, so that's fine.

874
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,740
 So yes, in the future, pending stuff and announcements.

875
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,700
 La-tida.

876
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,940
 Greg says, is there a public repository of things

877
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,140
 that people have already made, like quality of life things?

878
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,820
 There isn't a public repository.

879
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,300
 You can get a way of just asking people,

880
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,500
 or you can get away with a tool called

881
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,420
 RedX, which allows you to search through things

882
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,140
 that people made.

883
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,900
 Like, if you load RedX and you put in, I don't know,

884
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,540
 multi-tool, you'll probably just die,

885
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,780
 because it's going to be like four pages or something.

886
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,940
 But that's all we've really got.

887
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,700
 Eventually, we'll sort of get an inkling for it.

888
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,180
 We do want to make that better.

889
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:44,300
 That will be in the Marketplace sort of tools update thing,

890
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,900
 where you can kind of see, and we'll

891
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,820
 be able to categorize items down a little bit,

892
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,020
 so you'll be able to see there.

893
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,980
 And again, the front page of that Marketplace,

894
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,780
 I want to be entirely marketing driven.

895
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,460
 So if they want to have--

896
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,940
 this week, we're going to do a special on featuring hats.

897
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,820
 And the entire front page of the Marketplace

898
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,540
 is just like a feature of hats in a square.

899
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,100
 Again, just offload that kind of stuff from engineering.

900
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,500
 Make it so that someone who isn't engineering

901
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,460
 has a button to push.

902
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,340
 They're like, I'd like to feature hats today,

903
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,540
 and it just appears.

904
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,780
 I think I blocked sending sugar cubes, simply because it's not

905
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,900
 that it's a problem.

906
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,140
 It's that it's an unfinished feature.

907
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,740
 And so if you guys keep sending them, and then we finish it

908
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,660
 or remove it, it creates a dependence on something

909
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
 that we might remove.

910
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,220
 And so we don't want to do that.

911
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,020
 With that, I think we're done on questions.

912
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,620
 So avoid talking about other random stuff.

913
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,460
 Oh, there we go.

914
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,060
 There's a question.

915
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,860
 Aaron asked, what the fuck are sugar cubes?

916
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,540
 So sugar cubes were meant to be a unique thing,

917
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,780
 a physical object that was sent to you when

918
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,700
 you made a Ko-fi donation.

919
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,780
 I don't particularly know why that was a good idea or even

920
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,340
 an idea, but it never got implemented.

921
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,980
 There are bits of it still lying around,

922
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,180
 and hell knows why it's there.

923
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
 I found in the code base the other day--

924
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,540
 apparently it's public knowledge,

925
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,620
 so I don't mind saying it--

926
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,020
 we were going to have stickers in contact messages,

927
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,660
 like stickers in Telegram and in Discord now.

928
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,540
 We were going to have stickers inside messaging

929
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,500
 with inside Neos.

930
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,020
 And there wasn't code added for them,

931
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,900
 but there were graphics added for them.

932
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,860
 And they are basically larger versions of the Neos emojis

933
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,900
 there.

934
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,860
 Got more questions.

935
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,620
 So specs and rampa, you are the last two questions

936
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,660
 I'll accept, OK?

937
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,620
 I've got to get going.

938
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,340
 I've got to do other stuff, things.

939
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,060
 Yeah, OK?

940
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,980
 Nami, no.

941
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,020
 No question.

942
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,380
 You can still type, though, Nami.

943
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,220
 I'm not preventing you from typing.

944
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,700
 Just no question.

945
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,860
 OK, so Terra says, I noticed that there

946
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,020
 was a tool for making curves in the Scratch space world,

947
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,100
 but it's not in the essential tools folder.

948
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,380
 Why not?

949
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,020
 It's broken.

950
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,220
 We're probably going to remove it or fix it.

951
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,460
 It's very broken.

952
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,460
 It's a tool from 2013.

953
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,620
 It's very, very broken.

954
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,820
 Rig says, I was looking at the Patreon,

955
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,580
 and I saw that there was one mention that

956
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,260
 was being on the board.

957
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,580
 Is there a board on who is on it?

958
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,140
 That is a misleading statement, which I have asked

959
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,060
 to be removed multiple times.

960
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,940
 That Patreon tier will give you access

961
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,300
 to a once a month meeting, which is currently not being held,

962
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,580
 where you can speak to all of us.

963
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,100
 That's it.

964
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,220
 It's not being on the board.

965
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,740
 There is no paperwork.

966
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,780
 As for who is on the board, there is no board.

967
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,060
 I mean, sure, there kind of is.

968
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,780
 Like, technically-- well, actually, not technically,

969
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,580
 because it's long story read announcements.

970
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,900
 Hypothetically, there are three people

971
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,020
 on the board, which are all the people with C-level suite

972
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,060
 titles.

973
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,900
 Hypothetically is all they'll say.

974
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,340
 Hypothetically.

975
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,820
 Hand waving, jazz hands, moving onwards.

976
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,260
 Aaron says, why were they removed?

977
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,340
 If you're referring to the stickers,

978
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,300
 they were never implemented.

979
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,900
 You're referring to the sugar cubes,

980
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,980
 they were also never implemented.

981
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,300
 And that's it.

982
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,820
 Yeah, last week-- OK, so the problem

983
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,340
 with generating transcripts is I've

984
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,860
 noticed my CPU said spiking.

985
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,900
 And so if I'm doing anything active on my computer,

986
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,380
 I can't generate the transcript.

987
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,860
 And so I was just busy for the entire week.

988
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,740
 So I didn't have a chance to run it.

989
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,300
 I did run it when I fell asleep yesterday, though.

990
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,420
 I was like, well, my computer's on.

991
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,940
 So my computer's on, so I might as well run it.

992
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,500
 But I will run this one straight after,

993
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:20,100
 because I should just be doing low CPU activities after this,

994
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,860
 like getting a giant glass of water,

995
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,780
 because I've been talking a lot about stuff that

996
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,860
 isn't Neos related.

997
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,500
 We're going to leave off there and not take any more questions.

998
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,740
 If you have any additional questions past this,

999
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,460
 please drop them in the Questions Help channel,

1000
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,460
 DM me, open GitHub issues, open moderation tickets

1001
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,300
 if you have an issue.

1002
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,740
 I will see you again next week.

1003
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,060
 Maybe we need to start a second prime time where

1004
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,740
 I don't talk about Neos, and that way I

1005
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,660
 can tell you all the random stories I have.

1006
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,940
 I will speak to you guys later.
