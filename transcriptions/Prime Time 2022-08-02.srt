1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.720
All right. Recordings active. We'll go ahead and just type in office hours. We're live.

2
0:00:04.720 --> 0:00:14.720
And then we'll get going. Okay. So, as we had no, like, form up there,

3
0:00:14.720 --> 0:00:20.160
we'll go straight into questions with Specs's question. Specs asks, the VRIK component is

4
0:00:20.160 --> 0:00:23.840
very useful to know for avatar setup, but it doesn't seem well covered for how important

5
0:00:23.840 --> 0:00:26.960
it is. It helped me debug a friend's bone assignments this weekend. Sorry to discover

6
0:00:26.960 --> 0:00:31.040
the shorter role settings have been useful in adjusting shorter bone behavior for us.

7
0:00:31.040 --> 0:00:35.120
I'm sure it will be a lot of work, but a detailed overview of this component may be extremely

8
0:00:35.120 --> 0:00:37.920
useful to experienced users. Is there any chance we get a prime video on the topic?

9
0:00:39.280 --> 0:00:44.160
Maybe. The problem with the VRIK and the VRIK avatar components is that they have so many

10
0:00:44.160 --> 0:00:48.800
properties that I just don't know what they do. I know what, like, five of them do, but the rest

11
0:00:48.800 --> 0:00:54.080
of them I'm just not sure. There's a lot of numbers there, a lot of, like, sliders, a lot

12
0:00:54.080 --> 0:00:59.360
of random fields that don't seem to make sense. But they have lots of power in them. I did drop

13
0:00:59.360 --> 0:01:03.040
some content into the tutorials channel. I'm calling them pointers, because they're just,

14
0:01:03.040 --> 0:01:08.400
like, stuff I make in one minute. Not produced at all. But I was showing someone how to do

15
0:01:09.120 --> 0:01:13.680
custom walk animations with that. And a few other things there. And it was just, like,

16
0:01:13.680 --> 0:01:17.600
I don't know how half this component works, but if you mess with these numbers, you're going to

17
0:01:17.600 --> 0:01:23.680
get a different result. So, in the future, sure. Not quite sure when. I actually just need to go

18
0:01:23.680 --> 0:01:27.360
ahead and figure out a description for each of those properties, even if it means I, like,

19
0:01:27.360 --> 0:01:32.240
I don't know, I take fruits out for some fruit and I'm just like, all right, fruits. We've got

20
0:01:32.240 --> 0:01:41.120
400 fields to go, fruits. Let's do it. What does blah, blah, blah, blah do? However, there is one

21
0:01:41.120 --> 0:01:46.000
field which is really useful, which is arm length multiplier. I think it's in IK avatar, I'm not

22
0:01:46.000 --> 0:01:50.480
quite sure. It's in one of the two. Arm length multiplier will let you make your arms longer or

23
0:01:50.480 --> 0:01:56.320
shorter. I kept doing that for new users last week. Someone said, oh, how am I going to remember

24
0:01:56.320 --> 0:02:00.960
this, you know, if I need to change my arms later? And I said, well, you could remember it by the

25
0:02:00.960 --> 0:02:06.160
name I remember it internally, which is arm length my little pony and then you'll never forget it.

26
0:02:06.160 --> 0:02:11.120
So, remember, if your arms need to be shorter or longer, adjust your arm length, my little pony.

27
0:02:11.120 --> 0:02:17.760
But that's just me. Moving forwards. Yeah, actually, we didn't do any of that. Good call,

28
0:02:17.760 --> 0:02:23.680
Mr. Easton. So, for anyone who's new here or isn't familiar with office hours or hasn't seen them

29
0:02:23.680 --> 0:02:28.320
before, I sit here and answer questions and I inevitably start ranting about various objects

30
0:02:28.320 --> 0:02:33.360
or stories or experiences in life. But I'm meant to be answering nice questions. If you have any

31
0:02:33.360 --> 0:02:38.560
questions, please drop them in the office hours text chat that is it used to be two above the one

32
0:02:38.560 --> 0:02:43.680
that you're currently looking at for community meetings, but now it's one, two, three, four,

33
0:02:43.680 --> 0:02:47.040
five. So, it's five above the one that you're currently in because we added some extra voice

34
0:02:47.040 --> 0:02:52.000
chat channels just to spread out the load from the oncoming people. So, if you have questions

35
0:02:52.000 --> 0:02:55.520
about Neos, drop them into the office hours text chat. I'll get to them as soon as I can.

36
0:02:56.080 --> 0:03:00.880
Keep them coming and we'll keep answering them. Let's go ahead and move on to the next question

37
0:03:00.880 --> 0:03:06.800
here. So, Alex says made of interesting Neos lately. Yeah, you can actually find it I think

38
0:03:06.800 --> 0:03:13.360
it's in like the full dive Neos discussions and questions and help kind of just blur into my brain

39
0:03:13.360 --> 0:03:18.320
sometimes and I need to like remember which one I actually like posted it in. I'll drop it down to,

40
0:03:18.320 --> 0:03:24.640
here we go, let me see if I can just copy these holistically down. Where are we? Office hours,

41
0:03:24.640 --> 0:03:32.320
office hours, office hours, paste. Oh yes, a blank thing pasting. I'll just upload them again from

42
0:03:32.320 --> 0:03:38.080
my actual computer. We were looking at doing more, I'm doing like a lot of like science and

43
0:03:38.080 --> 0:03:45.600
sciency stuff with a user name shfr and we were doing science involving eye exams and so we had

44
0:03:45.600 --> 0:03:50.160
to come up with an anchor that forcibly put your head in a head restraint which is not something

45
0:03:50.160 --> 0:03:56.640
like anyone would probably do but it's something that we were doing for a particular goal. You can

46
0:03:56.640 --> 0:04:01.760
see that sphere there is me positioning a avatar pose filter so I can get the head in the right

47
0:04:01.760 --> 0:04:08.560
spot so it looks convincing. It is fun, you never quite know what you're gonna do. Everyone else is

48
0:04:08.560 --> 0:04:12.160
like oh let's make a game, let's make a world and those are fantastic, please keep making them.

49
0:04:12.160 --> 0:04:17.600
When it comes to science we're just like what? You need what? You sure? Okay.

50
0:04:20.480 --> 0:04:27.120
Ozzy asks what's your funniest unique encounter with users so far? So I always get like weirded

51
0:04:27.120 --> 0:04:31.760
out by the people who don't realize that like yes I am the YouTube person. It happens a lot. They're

52
0:04:31.760 --> 0:04:35.760
like you're the guy I watched YouTube videos on. I'm like yep that's me and they're like thanks for

53
0:04:35.760 --> 0:04:39.680
the videos. I'm like yep thank you for watching them. It's very simple. If you watch them,

54
0:04:39.680 --> 0:04:43.280
fantastic. If they help you, fantastic. If they don't help you, also fantastic. I don't mind.

55
0:04:43.920 --> 0:04:49.280
So it's always good to see those people. The funny or unique encounters usually occur when

56
0:04:50.320 --> 0:04:56.320
I'll suddenly go into like parent or teacher mode and I'll be like hey we don't do that here. So

57
0:04:56.320 --> 0:05:02.720
I was in a world this is actually just before the VRChat like big boom over here due to all

58
0:05:02.720 --> 0:05:10.640
that stuff and a kid came in. They sounded quite young and they walked up to an uninhabited avatar

59
0:05:10.640 --> 0:05:14.720
and started bullying it. You know they're insulting it, swearing at it, etc. And I walked

60
0:05:14.720 --> 0:05:19.840
over there I'm like hey we don't do that here. We're nice here. And you know the kid persisted

61
0:05:19.840 --> 0:05:25.440
for a little bit and eventually they stopped because I just wouldn't let them do it. I was

62
0:05:25.440 --> 0:05:29.600
like hey we don't do that here. I wouldn't argue with them. I was just like hey we just don't do

63
0:05:29.600 --> 0:05:35.120
that here. Eventually they got the picture and they apologized to the uninhabited avatar

64
0:05:35.120 --> 0:05:41.040
that no one was wearing. They're like sorry I was mean or whatever and that was that was that was

65
0:05:41.040 --> 0:05:49.280
fun. Alrighty scrolling down. Alright Shy River says can public avatars be fully exported from

66
0:05:49.280 --> 0:05:54.800
Neos? No you cannot export any type of avatar from Neos currently and that's because the moment you

67
0:05:54.800 --> 0:06:00.560
bring a skinned mesh which is what an avatar is into Neos it uh it gets uh garbled is the

68
0:06:00.560 --> 0:06:06.240
wrong word it gets translated into Neos format which is not currently exportable. That might

69
0:06:06.240 --> 0:06:13.280
change in the future but right now go ahead turn off this ac we'll have less brr noises.

70
0:06:13.280 --> 0:06:17.760
Let's move on to the next question here from unnamed cyborg cat. How exactly does the nitty

71
0:06:17.760 --> 0:06:21.520
gritty of avatar creation work? Like yeah there's a thing you put on the head and hands and stuff

72
0:06:21.520 --> 0:06:25.120
but what about where your eyes are or how to calibrate how big you are in comparison to

73
0:06:25.120 --> 0:06:30.000
the avatar itself? How does it all work? That depends exactly on what you want. You like you

74
0:06:30.000 --> 0:06:34.800
have like a couple of questions there which are sort of hidden behind that larger question like

75
0:06:34.800 --> 0:06:42.400
how does the avatar system work? It's very very very very complicated but for where the eyes are

76
0:06:42.400 --> 0:06:46.720
that is usually turned by we try and figure out if we can find the eyes if we see a bone called

77
0:06:46.720 --> 0:06:51.200
right eye left eye hey that's an eye bone. How big you are in comparison to the avatar itself

78
0:06:51.200 --> 0:06:57.520
is controlled by a height compensation field on the avatar that'll be under vrik or vrik avatar.

79
0:06:57.520 --> 0:07:03.040
Please for the love of god and everything that has ever been ever said to anyone in the planet

80
0:07:03.920 --> 0:07:10.400
both in vr chat and on neos in the settings there is a height setting you set it to your real world

81
0:07:10.400 --> 0:07:15.840
height or i will personally come and send you angry cat gifs the reason is because uh we get

82
0:07:15.840 --> 0:07:19.120
a lot of people changing the height setting so that they can change how big they are in comparison

83
0:07:19.120 --> 0:07:24.160
the avatar completely wrong way of doing it there's height compensation which will map how

84
0:07:24.160 --> 0:07:29.440
tall the avatar is compared to your real world height and then there's also um the default user

85
0:07:29.440 --> 0:07:32.720
scale component which allows you to be small should you want to be small so not actually to

86
0:07:32.720 --> 0:07:36.480
be big although i don't know anyone that does that but uh default user scale is how you become sort

87
0:07:36.480 --> 0:07:42.320
of smaller than than you want to be uh do not set your height to anything other than your real world

88
0:07:42.320 --> 0:07:47.600
height otherwise i will send you angry cat gifs you quite clearly like it says put in your height

89
0:07:47.600 --> 0:07:52.000
and everyone's like if i put in a smaller height my avatar looks better and i'm like well just to

90
0:07:52.000 --> 0:07:56.000
use the appropriate tools for the job please please erin doesn't know their real height you

91
0:07:56.000 --> 0:08:03.040
you get a ruler and you figure it out moving forwards now he asks uh will there be unity

92
0:08:03.040 --> 0:08:07.600
package support eventually that is a difficult answer because what i want you to remember is

93
0:08:07.600 --> 0:08:13.680
that we aren't unity we are right now but we're going aiming to not be unity now a unity package

94
0:08:13.680 --> 0:08:19.120
is essentially just like a zip archive with a bunch of like crap on top of it and so me

95
0:08:19.120 --> 0:08:24.000
personally even before i knew what neos was i got really annoyed at unity packages it seems like a

96
0:08:24.000 --> 0:08:30.480
really inefficient way to submit avatars across like i don't understand like it just just the

97
0:08:30.480 --> 0:08:35.440
problem that the largest problem with unity packages being hey hey it's a format that we

98
0:08:35.440 --> 0:08:40.880
don't really own and then be the materials we can't map one to one the material so it doesn't

99
0:08:40.880 --> 0:08:44.400
really work the best thing that we can do currently i know there's some mods out there that

100
0:08:44.400 --> 0:08:49.680
do it but like you know the best thing that we as neos could do is scan through that unity package

101
0:08:49.680 --> 0:08:54.640
find the assets and dump them into a world for you which is really what the the mod does it's

102
0:08:54.640 --> 0:09:01.360
just not that simple right we're not unity and so that needs to be respected by our users we of

103
0:09:01.360 --> 0:09:06.320
course can make the avatar setup process more easier more better more intuitive and stuff like

104
0:09:06.320 --> 0:09:12.400
that but i don't think we're going to get to the point where it is like a vrchat import it actually

105
0:09:12.400 --> 0:09:18.160
probably diverge further and further away from what our vrchat import is uh whilst also still

106
0:09:18.160 --> 0:09:24.640
being easier and that might lead to oddities that haven't been foreseen but uh the best way to look

107
0:09:24.640 --> 0:09:30.080
at that is hey if you had started making avatars uh with neos and not vrchat you'd probably be

108
0:09:30.080 --> 0:09:36.080
saying the other way around you'd be like whoa you know vrchat doesn't just take my fbx

109
0:09:36.080 --> 0:09:42.640
file and make it into an avatar so i guess in summary an easier process yes specifically unity

110
0:09:42.640 --> 0:09:50.000
packages possibly but also possibly not you really i guess need to ask um like more questions there

111
0:09:50.000 --> 0:09:55.760
like why don't you have your files knocked in here that's another interesting and unique experience

112
0:09:55.760 --> 0:10:00.640
with with new users is uh when i'm helping them import their avatar and they manage to find the

113
0:10:00.640 --> 0:10:06.560
fbx for their you know their avatars like being the flesh and the skin the the armature etc they

114
0:10:06.560 --> 0:10:09.680
bring it in and i'm like great now import your textures and they're like i don't know where those

115
0:10:09.680 --> 0:10:15.040
are and i just give them instructions and uh it always goes fun i've had someone manage to

116
0:10:15.040 --> 0:10:19.280
import the fbx and then two hours later they're still trying to find their textures it's it's

117
0:10:19.280 --> 0:10:27.680
i don't know i don't understand sometimes why um like finding files on your computer is difficult

118
0:10:27.680 --> 0:10:32.240
i see people within like my downloads folder is full of like thousands of items just clean it up

119
0:10:32.240 --> 0:10:35.920
if you're watching a film clean it up if you're watching some tv clean up you'll have a lot better

120
0:10:35.920 --> 0:10:44.320
time let's go ahead and move down into more and more questions all right here we are uh slide

121
0:10:44.320 --> 0:10:51.280
swap region what does the slide slot what does this slide swap region component do under uix

122
0:10:51.280 --> 0:10:58.160
utility is there any there there isn't any documentation on the wiki i don't know um i do

123
0:10:58.160 --> 0:11:04.160
have the code base open so i can just have a quick look based on what i'm reading here it isn't usable

124
0:11:04.160 --> 0:11:12.320
by uh yes find all references let's see if there's a way that does it okay yeah um so the uh login

125
0:11:12.320 --> 0:11:22.080
dialog uses it and the uh file browser uses it uh for similar functionality you probably want what's

126
0:11:22.080 --> 0:11:28.960
it called as a component um that i'm thinking of access multi-viewport panel would be exactly the

127
0:11:28.960 --> 0:11:35.920
same as slide swap region it's in uix uh utility access multi-viewport panel will do identical

128
0:11:35.920 --> 0:11:41.200
things to slide swap region based on my current reading of it fenre who um asks what's your

129
0:11:41.200 --> 0:11:45.360
current thoughts on the rise of the player base uh in the game compared before i don't really have

130
0:11:45.360 --> 0:11:51.200
any thoughts about it it's great to see you all um i love that all of you are trying neos but um

131
0:11:51.200 --> 0:11:57.280
you know it's for us a lot it's just sort of like hey welcome try us out we're a lot busier i guess

132
0:11:57.280 --> 0:12:02.320
but like i don't know it's it's a strange question if you can elaborate on that question or ask in

133
0:12:02.320 --> 0:12:06.960
the area that you're asking for that'd be great kind of struggle with generic questions sometimes

134
0:12:06.960 --> 0:12:12.720
toasty my roasty amazing username here uh they ask are there any new worlds places recommend new

135
0:12:12.720 --> 0:12:19.840
players uh should see visit to experience new unique features i want everyone to see uh like

136
0:12:19.840 --> 0:12:25.760
all of the sort of the spectrum right so i want you to see a game world to try um abandonware

137
0:12:26.720 --> 0:12:34.320
ncr the heist uh cabin of the seasons even fropey's i can't remember fropey's entry name

138
0:12:34.320 --> 0:12:40.160
something dark something i don't know it's really really good though i've just forgot its name

139
0:12:40.160 --> 0:12:44.800
uh those are games try some social worlds yep we do have uh rim of the rain we also do have midnight

140
0:12:44.800 --> 0:12:50.880
rooftop but we do have ones that vrchat doesn't have um 72 groove lake um hole in the wall one

141
0:12:50.880 --> 0:12:56.240
of my favorites um uh various other ones there that i'm i'm not gonna be able to remember by

142
0:12:56.240 --> 0:13:01.600
name if i didn't mention your um your world don't be sad it's just like there are thousands of

143
0:13:01.600 --> 0:13:04.640
worlds i need to get to them so make sure take a look at those social worlds make sure you also

144
0:13:04.640 --> 0:13:09.920
take a look at sort of experiential worlds as well um go touch grass is kind of like a game

145
0:13:09.920 --> 0:13:14.960
but more like an experience right uh if it was on steam it would probably be tagged walking simulator

146
0:13:14.960 --> 0:13:20.720
uh just just like see what there is to offer i see so many people treat this game as like

147
0:13:21.280 --> 0:13:26.320
gary's mod you know they'll just load into like in some cases literally a gary's mod map

148
0:13:26.320 --> 0:13:32.640
um and then they'll just spawn guns all day like that isn't like that isn't in my view what neos

149
0:13:32.640 --> 0:13:37.520
is for like all the gadgets are great but like um i don't know it's like a year or two ago i

150
0:13:37.520 --> 0:13:43.040
just stopped saving cool stuff right i i don't need the latest guns someone shows me in their

151
0:13:43.040 --> 0:13:49.040
world i don't need the latest like weird thing that i've i've seen i know where like loads of

152
0:13:49.040 --> 0:13:53.520
them are in public folders but like i don't feel the need to without a gun start shooting people

153
0:13:53.520 --> 0:13:58.480
like it is gary's mod um so do make sure that you're seeing all of the stuff that we've got

154
0:13:58.480 --> 0:14:04.400
to offer neos universe is another good suggestion as is um gas station that may mentions neos

155
0:14:04.400 --> 0:14:09.360
festival is amazing it's just started i know that content is being raised for neos festival as it

156
0:14:09.360 --> 0:14:14.640
continues to come out so do keep an eye on that one the the weird thing with neos festival is like

157
0:14:14.640 --> 0:14:22.080
it is identical in in some aspects to the previous neos festers but it feels great because they've

158
0:14:22.080 --> 0:14:29.920
managed to make like an art browsing like or a booth browsing sort of system that that feels fun

159
0:14:29.920 --> 0:14:37.520
you ride on this skyship and uh you know it takes you between the booths it's really like a another

160
0:14:37.520 --> 0:14:44.240
way of also hiding that loading bar so uh that's cool moving forwards to pyro shade who says uh

161
0:14:44.240 --> 0:14:48.320
i had noticed while bringing an fbx drag from unity project window that neos importing mentioned

162
0:14:48.320 --> 0:14:52.160
something about converting a scene i haven't tried this here but what happens if i dragged in scene

163
0:14:52.160 --> 0:14:57.280
or objects from a scene hierarchy you can't do that uh we don't support any unity files like

164
0:14:57.280 --> 0:15:02.880
doesn't work um when it's just converting the scene um it means it's looking at the fbx because

165
0:15:02.880 --> 0:15:08.000
like although for avatars you don't usually see it uh for like a level that's an fbx you would

166
0:15:08.000 --> 0:15:12.720
like it is a scene right that's what fbx is it's a whole scene what converting scene means is it's

167
0:15:12.720 --> 0:15:17.920
like well what's in the scene so neos knows enough about avatar imports to understand that it should

168
0:15:17.920 --> 0:15:22.800
ignore cameras and lights that you import especially if it's an avatar i don't need those

169
0:15:22.800 --> 0:15:26.080
and then it converts that into something that makes sense to it that's that's all it means

170
0:15:26.080 --> 0:15:31.520
it's not like we don't support scenes from unity um alex is one of the editorial delegates would

171
0:15:31.520 --> 0:15:35.600
have to be more specific there delegates aren't something you should usually be playing with if

172
0:15:35.600 --> 0:15:39.280
you have any particular questions about where you might be wanting to use them or how you might want

173
0:15:39.280 --> 0:15:45.440
to be using them let me know um you don't really need them uh lou says news from vr share is the

174
0:15:45.440 --> 0:15:51.600
way to dynamically change avatar parts absolutely there is um you said rgb cycling um i have a video

175
0:15:51.600 --> 0:15:55.840
i'm going to link in the video description about a rainbow shader i call it shader just for search

176
0:15:55.840 --> 0:16:04.160
terms it's a material that is um uh targeted using logics and you can basically do triple quadruple

177
0:16:04.160 --> 0:16:11.200
like quintuple 10 times the stuff i show in this video just by iterating over the properties of a

178
0:16:11.200 --> 0:16:16.320
material um and that's something which i really wish more newer players would understand as well

179
0:16:16.320 --> 0:16:21.920
as like yes our material options are limited but all of our materials are dynamic and live

180
0:16:21.920 --> 0:16:28.640
updating on as many of uh the as many of the places as as we can right you want to change

181
0:16:28.640 --> 0:16:32.720
the color you can do it live you want to change the color 50 times a second to your favorite

182
0:16:32.720 --> 0:16:40.080
color of sandwich done um if you're talking more about like changing parts as in like hats scarves

183
0:16:40.080 --> 0:16:46.560
bracelets jackets than yet again like that that's totally fine um you can use snappers for that

184
0:16:46.560 --> 0:16:51.040
context menus for that check boxes for that cloud very there's so much stuff there like again here's

185
0:16:51.040 --> 0:16:55.760
a video where i uh i put on a hat and bracelet and i'll show you how i do that because like what

186
0:16:55.760 --> 0:17:01.920
what what unity does and sort of by extension vr chat right is it is it when you hit play or

187
0:17:01.920 --> 0:17:07.040
when you compile it like freezes everything that exists in place and doesn't let you change it like

188
0:17:07.040 --> 0:17:11.680
sure if you've got code in your unity game that says like hey the hat changes that's great but

189
0:17:11.680 --> 0:17:16.880
that's code that has to be sort of pre-thought out ahead of time whereas what we've done is we've

190
0:17:16.880 --> 0:17:21.520
said like hey we don't know if you're going to wear a hat but what allow you to wear a hat like

191
0:17:21.520 --> 0:17:25.760
you don't need to pre-think of it like anything you can think of you can probably do moving

192
0:17:25.760 --> 0:17:29.600
forwards for questions aaron says my working progress photo is getting too big and suggestions

193
0:17:29.600 --> 0:17:34.880
on how to start finishing my projects stop giving up stop giving up that would be my suggestion for

194
0:17:34.880 --> 0:17:39.280
mr aaron i see them like they're like i'm tired and then they delete it and it's like go back to

195
0:17:39.280 --> 0:17:43.840
it benry has elaborated on the question thank you they've said uh like did you ever think you would

196
0:17:43.840 --> 0:17:47.360
suddenly get a blow up of people do you feel prepared uh to get so many people or not are

197
0:17:47.360 --> 0:17:52.640
you just going to the flow of that really really plan uh there is a plan um and the plan is

198
0:17:52.640 --> 0:18:00.800
spearheaded by both of our fantastic volunteer teams so we over provisioned and i knew why we

199
0:18:00.800 --> 0:18:06.720
were doing that but we over provisioned our mentor team and in some regards our moderator team such

200
0:18:06.720 --> 0:18:10.720
that we could handle the load so we got a bunch of mentors on in fact mentor applications have

201
0:18:10.720 --> 0:18:14.240
like been open and closed a little bit but they've just been like wide open recently

202
0:18:14.240 --> 0:18:21.120
and uh a lot of times the mentors were not not doing anything right but like we only needed like

203
0:18:21.120 --> 0:18:27.520
two or three to help out at like certain busy periods during our regular play but we've had

204
0:18:27.520 --> 0:18:32.960
this big rush and the mentors have just gone like yep we'll help out and then there's been 10 20 40

205
0:18:32.960 --> 0:18:38.480
50 mentors flooding in to try and help you guys out and that's great to see and the reason why

206
0:18:38.480 --> 0:18:42.560
that worked is because we had over provisioned that that volunteer team if you're interested

207
0:18:42.560 --> 0:18:48.400
in becoming a mentor do you check out the wiki um wiki.neos.com forward slash mentors will get you

208
0:18:48.400 --> 0:18:53.360
information on how to be a mentor there one quick note to know that if you're here um you do not

209
0:18:53.360 --> 0:18:57.520
need to be a mentor to help people and if a mentor appears and you are helping someone you should

210
0:18:57.520 --> 0:19:02.000
continue helping them don't yield to a mentor because you feel that they are more qualified

211
0:19:02.000 --> 0:19:06.880
or that it's more correct that they help people uh mentor is just someone who wants to go through

212
0:19:06.880 --> 0:19:10.560
that process and have the green badge to be recognized as someone who can help you can help

213
0:19:10.560 --> 0:19:14.880
without being a mentor and as for mentors if you go into a world and someone is helping read the

214
0:19:14.880 --> 0:19:20.080
room and uh maybe don't take over i've heard a lot of feedback about that recently and it bothers me

215
0:19:20.080 --> 0:19:25.200
that we keep hearing that feedback so do keep that in mind um our servers were less prepared

216
0:19:25.200 --> 0:19:29.600
than we realized which is a shame but uh that's the way it is sometimes um most of our stuff can

217
0:19:29.600 --> 0:19:35.120
scale uh quite dynamically but sometimes there's like an upper or lower limit on that so you can

218
0:19:35.120 --> 0:19:40.560
think of it like uh you know a dial on like a stereo or something right we can turn it up by

219
0:19:40.560 --> 0:19:44.480
like two points but suddenly it was like hey we need to go to like we need to go to 11 we need to

220
0:19:44.480 --> 0:19:49.040
go to 11 on these dials anyone that gets this reference you're amazing we need to go 11 on these

221
0:19:49.040 --> 0:19:53.360
dials and it's like cool we have to remove like a couple of blocks there to allow it to go to 11

222
0:19:53.360 --> 0:19:57.360
moving on ones two additional questions we have from olaf who says it's a way to have an avatar

223
0:19:57.360 --> 0:20:01.920
return to t pose to more easily add things on like hats or clothing and over the character avatar

224
0:20:01.920 --> 0:20:08.720
changes pose yes uh go inside inspect the root of the avatar it's vrik or vrik avatar i just can't

225
0:20:08.720 --> 0:20:12.560
remember the difference between those two the reason is they're just really big components that

226
0:20:12.560 --> 0:20:16.800
are on top of each other they're always on the same slot and i just i can't one of them will have

227
0:20:16.800 --> 0:20:22.000
ik position wait drag that down to zero and your avatar will t pose just making sure i'm missing

228
0:20:22.000 --> 0:20:28.240
any questions before i scroll down scrolling down mattie says that the mentor team was not prepared

229
0:20:28.240 --> 0:20:33.520
for the exponential growth i think you were more prepared than if you'd like said yo we we only

230
0:20:33.520 --> 0:20:39.200
have like we're only allowing five mentors this year like you were basically like anyone can apply

231
0:20:39.200 --> 0:20:44.160
uh sir says hey don't forget the community members they did as well i did not mean to say that they

232
0:20:44.160 --> 0:20:48.480
didn't in fact i made a particular call out to hell if you're not a mentor you don't need to be

233
0:20:48.480 --> 0:20:53.920
one if you want to help like anyone can help uh i've seen crazy amounts of help going on uh i have

234
0:20:53.920 --> 0:20:58.000
a really weird way of doing anyone that saw me drop into your mtc if there was a user there that

235
0:20:58.000 --> 0:21:02.080
had more than five badges i'm like are you helping these guys out and they're like yep i'm like i'll

236
0:21:02.080 --> 0:21:05.440
leave you to it if you got any questions let me know and i'll just instantly disconnect like i

237
0:21:05.440 --> 0:21:10.240
don't want to crowd them like if they're helping someone out just disconnect uh moving onwards

238
0:21:10.240 --> 0:21:15.680
foxbox says i had a session um hoping to help new users and they filled my session it was just me

239
0:21:15.680 --> 0:21:20.560
and nine other new users asking for my help it wasn't too bad because they uh goofed off in the

240
0:21:20.560 --> 0:21:25.200
background waited their turn yeah i also had that i was in a world of like six people and by the

241
0:21:25.200 --> 0:21:30.160
time i got to the last person who wanted an avatar set up it was 5 a.m i did all their materials and

242
0:21:30.160 --> 0:21:36.720
texturing um and they sort of timidly asked about dynamic bones and i just went tomorrow please

243
0:21:36.720 --> 0:21:40.480
tomorrow that's another thing for the mentors out there and for the community members that are

244
0:21:40.480 --> 0:21:45.600
helping out you guys can go to bed it's not a job there are no minimum hours there's no maximum

245
0:21:45.600 --> 0:21:50.640
hours either work will uh fill the available space and the available time that exists in the day

246
0:21:50.640 --> 0:21:57.280
so stop don't play nios for the entire 24 hours that you're awake um or exist on the planet if

247
0:21:57.280 --> 0:22:02.320
you're not awake for the entire 24 hours you know i mean it's like go play i don't know have a kitty

248
0:22:02.320 --> 0:22:07.040
online adventure instead of nios for a bit and chill out get some water in you and then chill

249
0:22:07.040 --> 0:22:13.680
out moving forwards we have jelly gecko hello who says i'm in the process of creating avatars capable

250
0:22:13.680 --> 0:22:18.080
of shape-shifting in this case shape-shifting implies going from a character to a monstrous form

251
0:22:18.080 --> 0:22:22.560
i'm also interested in oh kitting i thought it said knitting and then i thought it said kiting

252
0:22:22.560 --> 0:22:28.560
knit kitting out to the human character of different outfits in addition to uh his default

253
0:22:28.560 --> 0:22:32.240
getup obviously there's a lot of data to be dealing with though can the idea of an avatar be

254
0:22:32.240 --> 0:22:36.720
broken up into different files that components we can load as needed uh not dynamically but in some

255
0:22:36.720 --> 0:22:43.120
regards yes um so just as you might have a hat that can be snapped on if you do it correctly

256
0:22:43.120 --> 0:22:50.320
and amati if you're still in chat they have a um good example um you can do like snappable clothing

257
0:22:50.320 --> 0:22:56.560
snappable ab um uh outfits uh snappable systems and all sorts of stuff like that which means you

258
0:22:56.560 --> 0:23:01.200
should just load it from the inventory um i do have actually a note on that one but i'll leave

259
0:23:01.200 --> 0:23:04.320
that until we run out of questions because i didn't do it at the start because i was running

260
0:23:04.320 --> 0:23:10.880
late so uh yes moving uh forwards oh left says is this office hours audio getting recorded yes

261
0:23:10.880 --> 0:23:16.800
everything gets recorded sometimes i do get um like uh forgetful in uploading it but like there

262
0:23:16.800 --> 0:23:25.040
is a recording and it will be on sounder.fm as soon as i can get it there uh yes um there is

263
0:23:25.040 --> 0:23:30.240
before i started using sounder i did text based notes those just got like really unwieldy um if

264
0:23:30.240 --> 0:23:33.840
you'd like to see more text based notes you're more than welcome to transcribe the recordings

265
0:23:33.840 --> 0:23:37.840
um there is an automatic transcription feature which i'm working with sounder on improving

266
0:23:37.840 --> 0:23:43.520
because right now it lags at my computer um let's move on to pyroshade why is that green

267
0:23:43.520 --> 0:23:47.600
tick not as green today like do i have a colorblind filter or something i'm very confused

268
0:23:47.600 --> 0:23:52.560
anyway um pyroshade says something has went on my mind is level building in respect to custom

269
0:23:52.560 --> 0:23:57.120
geometry while blender is a fantastic tool i can't help imagine there's liable to in-game

270
0:23:57.120 --> 0:24:00.400
tools someone has likely created for creating geometry on the fly do you have any tools for

271
0:24:00.400 --> 0:24:06.560
this and what you recommend um there's two types of of like buildings or geometry that uh you'd

272
0:24:06.560 --> 0:24:11.920
likely need to create for a world one of them would be terrain so we're talking like grass

273
0:24:11.920 --> 0:24:19.040
hills etc stuff like that and then the other one would be buildings you know a house a warehouse a

274
0:24:19.040 --> 0:24:26.240
hut a shed a bridge or whatever for uh terrain um there are some terrain editors the problem with

275
0:24:26.240 --> 0:24:31.920
those is that they are usually not as flexible as a mainstream terrain editors that you might find

276
0:24:31.920 --> 0:24:36.880
are but you can still go ahead and get away with them uh the terrain editor that i'm thinking of

277
0:24:36.880 --> 0:24:40.400
was when mmc entries so you should be able to find it just by searching for terrain editor

278
0:24:40.400 --> 0:24:44.640
it lets you edit terrain in in game uva editing is another problem you might have with editing

279
0:24:44.640 --> 0:24:51.680
creating game um as for buildings uh the builder tip by gahape which is one of the members of our

280
0:24:51.680 --> 0:24:57.520
fantastic news community is what i would recommend i don't have a link to it or a tutorial for it

281
0:24:57.520 --> 0:25:01.840
um so it might be a little bit difficult to find but if you go to essential tools jp tools it

282
0:25:01.840 --> 0:25:06.880
should be somewhere in there uh look for gappy's builder tip it allows you to snap stuff together

283
0:25:06.880 --> 0:25:11.760
on a grid how all sorts of parts have custom parts it's it's really good really quick um

284
0:25:11.760 --> 0:25:15.360
if i can remember where it is i've been trying to find it for a couple of days i haven't managed

285
0:25:15.360 --> 0:25:20.960
to find it there is a video i think by kahape which is like here's me building a house in 45

286
0:25:20.960 --> 0:25:26.880
minutes and they just use the the builder tip and make a whole house it's crazy uh matty says i've

287
0:25:26.880 --> 0:25:33.360
threatened a public banner and mentor leads before overworking yeah rest rest mentors community

288
0:25:33.360 --> 0:25:40.640
members moderators rest it can wait it can wait it can wait alex says that they are using uh

289
0:25:40.640 --> 0:25:45.920
they're using green tick rather than white check mark which is why i'm i'm not crazy excellent

290
0:25:45.920 --> 0:25:52.080
thank you uh i i don't know where like i don't know how to get a happy tool other than like just

291
0:25:52.080 --> 0:25:55.920
browsing through my folders which of course i can do whilst we wait for a few more questions

292
0:25:55.920 --> 0:25:59.040
so i'm just gonna go ahead and do that let me just make sure i'm not missing any yeah i'm not

293
0:25:59.040 --> 0:26:07.440
missing any questions uh is it even in this folder these days uh grab body node pack cd player gimbal

294
0:26:07.440 --> 0:26:12.720
gimbal no it's not okay so their folder isn't in there i'll have to find that in the public folder

295
0:26:12.720 --> 0:26:20.720
listing then uh gee items okay yeah i got it let me just get a link that for you there you go if

296
0:26:20.720 --> 0:26:27.600
you paste that in the game uh you'll get a gap is a public folder get these items inside that

297
0:26:27.600 --> 0:26:36.080
folder you will find a folder called tool tip go inside there and you will uh see a bunch of tips

298
0:26:36.080 --> 0:26:43.360
uh look for the builder tip um build it at 1.1 and then it's there unfortunately i have no guide on

299
0:26:43.360 --> 0:26:48.560
how to use it if someone else would like to make one of those fantastic uh great but uh i haven't

300
0:26:48.560 --> 0:26:52.720
actually managed to like make a guide for how to use it yet mostly because i'm like not quite sure

301
0:26:52.720 --> 0:26:57.760
but i know it's really cool and a lot of people have a lot of a great time with it mellow has

302
0:26:57.760 --> 0:27:02.000
a question which says i really apologize if this discussed already if it was discussed already it's

303
0:27:02.000 --> 0:27:05.760
totally fine i would answer anyway you just keep asking questions and don't worry about what you

304
0:27:05.760 --> 0:27:11.440
worry about what the question is um i will answer it all day if i if i need to um they say is there

305
0:27:11.440 --> 0:27:15.280
a plan to implement client-side filters for other people's advertisement how optimized they are

306
0:27:15.280 --> 0:27:22.880
not currently our um approach there would probably be what can we remove um from your cognitive load

307
0:27:22.880 --> 0:27:27.760
i mean by that is i'm always looking for stuff i can remove from your mental load not because i

308
0:27:27.760 --> 0:27:32.320
don't think anyone can do it but just because like hey it's a game it's a platform we should make

309
0:27:32.320 --> 0:27:37.920
things easy where if we can for our users so if there is a performance problem with a particular

310
0:27:37.920 --> 0:27:45.360
avatar we'd like to see what we can do to edit that to make that better um so an example there

311
0:27:45.360 --> 0:27:50.960
being hey let's actually start with user to user blocking um which we don't have currently and we

312
0:27:50.960 --> 0:27:57.120
need before we go on to any sort of performance based stuff bean bean m chocolate that's kind of

313
0:27:57.120 --> 0:28:01.360
difficult to phrase there um they said they've got something weird attached to them if you're

314
0:28:01.360 --> 0:28:06.400
worried about what you've got um attached to you parented to you or like what's going on best

315
0:28:06.400 --> 0:28:12.000
result is to leave the world and rejoin or respawn or change avatar it should go away if it doesn't

316
0:28:12.000 --> 0:28:16.880
um that may be something malicious in which case please open a report at moderation.neos.com for

317
0:28:16.880 --> 0:28:22.800
us to take a look um from the pictures it appears to be a multi-tool that you've somehow equipped

318
0:28:22.800 --> 0:28:28.160
um you can just de-equip that tool and it should go away respawning is the the best way to like

319
0:28:28.160 --> 0:28:33.600
get get that sorted um jelly yeah i'm not sure if we have like a cross communication there like

320
0:28:33.600 --> 0:28:38.000
i'm not saying you could split them into separate avatars and ultimately that's what i would probably

321
0:28:38.000 --> 0:28:44.480
advise but if you wanted a jacket a hat i don't know whatever that you could attach to the avatar

322
0:28:44.480 --> 0:28:50.960
there are ways to do that as linked in matty's post above i have a hat which i don't ever wear

323
0:28:50.960 --> 0:28:57.040
but sometimes can if i want to wear for example moving forwards to more questions so robo man

324
0:28:57.040 --> 0:29:01.920
410 hello what are some of the top games activities the community has made um i don't like

325
0:29:01.920 --> 0:29:06.800
doing that because like i would have to then choose my favorites and that's wrong um do you remember

326
0:29:06.800 --> 0:29:11.840
that the world browser has um a game selection and you can go ahead and click that and then you'll

327
0:29:11.840 --> 0:29:17.040
see a bunch of stuff there uh at the top of my head thinking about things if you want to go see

328
0:29:17.040 --> 0:29:22.080
like crazy crazy crazy stuff this isn't good this isn't bad this is just crazy stuff from memory

329
0:29:22.080 --> 0:29:28.080
go take a look at h&l uh ironworks that lets you smith smith weapons um the newest fishing lets

330
0:29:28.080 --> 0:29:34.080
you fish aerial garden guardian mmc feels like a whole game really like it's it's uh it needs

331
0:29:34.080 --> 0:29:37.840
some more polish before i would you know be okay of like launching on steam or anything but like

332
0:29:37.840 --> 0:29:42.800
it's a it's a good game there is uh there is lots lots there please build more as well if you have

333
0:29:42.800 --> 0:29:47.120
an idea for a game just go ahead and build it if you need help ask us all right let's move on to

334
0:29:47.120 --> 0:29:51.440
question olef says how would you make an emitter of some sorts that spawns a random model plus

335
0:29:51.440 --> 0:29:57.920
texture from a list of models that move and move rotate said spawned model on a path from a to b

336
0:29:57.920 --> 0:30:04.560
and how to make the model gets despawned watch it reads its destination there's a component called

337
0:30:04.560 --> 0:30:08.160
random object spawner it's a target for one of my next tutorials because i saw some people

338
0:30:08.160 --> 0:30:11.520
discussing it earlier today and they didn't know how to use it so they didn't use it it's quite

339
0:30:11.520 --> 0:30:17.200
cool uh you should probably use that um and if you want to go from point a to point b you could use

340
0:30:17.200 --> 0:30:22.320
a uh skinned not skin mesh render what we're talking about a line transform

341
0:30:22.880 --> 0:30:28.720
axis panner or the tween node to move that uh as for despawning it there is logic node called

342
0:30:28.720 --> 0:30:34.960
delete destroy slot which will destroy the slot and anything underneath it uh so your approximate

343
0:30:34.960 --> 0:30:42.240
plan would be spawn the thingy uh move it using tween axis panner line transform even alert would

344
0:30:42.240 --> 0:30:48.400
do it actually and then destroy or destroy slot moving uh forwards if you've got any specific

345
0:30:48.400 --> 0:30:55.280
questions about uh that particular setup do let me know um because uh i can just give you like

346
0:30:55.280 --> 0:31:00.560
a bunch of videos like basically there's a video i made on reciprocal motion which means back and

347
0:31:00.560 --> 0:31:04.800
forth like that should apply to sort of one direction as well if you just take off half of it

348
0:31:04.800 --> 0:31:10.320
uh hack 13 asks what is the what is the too much respawn disconnect gestures i get them mixed up and

349
0:31:10.320 --> 0:31:14.000
i want to make sure i remember which combos the buttons on next my head do it uh go look at the

350
0:31:14.000 --> 0:31:18.080
basic controls page on the wiki because i always forget them too and therefore don't use them

351
0:31:18.640 --> 0:31:24.160
but basic control should have a list and remind you what which ones which etc okay let's continue

352
0:31:24.160 --> 0:31:27.360
erin says this is a moderation question but i'm never here for these office hours things

353
0:31:27.360 --> 0:31:30.160
are you informed about the outcome of the moderation tickets you filed example you're

354
0:31:30.160 --> 0:31:34.160
asked by something and something then decided to stay away from public worlds worth being taken

355
0:31:34.160 --> 0:31:39.360
care of you are notified when we receive a ticket some people say that that is like a robot thing

356
0:31:39.360 --> 0:31:44.720
like that's not actually a person yes it is automated in some aspects but it's like we've

357
0:31:44.720 --> 0:31:50.400
received it we're processing it you'll also um get various messages sometimes we ask for more

358
0:31:50.400 --> 0:31:55.120
information uh if we ask you for more information please provide it and you'll also get the sort of

359
0:31:55.120 --> 0:32:00.000
ticket closed i don't remember the exact phrasing of that um but to sort of back that up we're

360
0:32:00.000 --> 0:32:04.400
never going to tell you what we did and the reason behind that is because it just leads to it just

361
0:32:04.400 --> 0:32:08.720
leads to drama right so it's you're never going to get like you say you put in a ticket which is like

362
0:32:08.720 --> 0:32:13.600
yo i'm being harassed by erin you're never getting a response which is hi yeah we banned erin for the

363
0:32:13.600 --> 0:32:17.920
rest of their life from neo so you're not going to get that like you'll get like hey moderation

364
0:32:17.920 --> 0:32:21.760
has taken appropriate action or moderation has reviewed this and taken appropriate action or

365
0:32:21.760 --> 0:32:25.680
something like that isn't because like we're hiding it from you it just it prevents all

366
0:32:25.680 --> 0:32:30.640
sorts of like weird cases where people yell at each other people are strange when it comes to

367
0:32:30.640 --> 0:32:37.280
moderation uh moving forwards let's take a look so dat uh asks is there any documentation for

368
0:32:37.280 --> 0:32:40.880
networking because i'm struggling a lot with my current game that needs a lot of sync um

369
0:32:40.880 --> 0:32:45.840
do you mean like the sync progress thing like syncing five items at the top etc

370
0:32:45.840 --> 0:32:51.520
because like i've noticed that being a problem in users but i i don't know why i have been playing

371
0:32:51.520 --> 0:32:58.320
the game for many many years and i've never had a sync issue um the usual ways to like avoid having

372
0:32:58.320 --> 0:33:03.520
sync issues are to make sure that your hard drive space is not going to fill up and also that your

373
0:33:03.520 --> 0:33:09.440
cloud space is not going to fill up and also that you are only saving the stuff that you need i see

374
0:33:09.440 --> 0:33:14.960
people that are pack riding stuff away and it's like ah please stop saving that like do you need

375
0:33:14.960 --> 0:33:22.640
the 5000 weapons that you're saving please no um okay sold that has as a clarified network sync

376
0:33:22.640 --> 0:33:26.800
between players that is largely dependent on where you are located and where those players are

377
0:33:26.800 --> 0:33:32.560
located and how fast your internet is um so we we do have a way of going between players it's

378
0:33:32.560 --> 0:33:37.920
called our relay um but if that relay isn't used then you're either using steam sockets

379
0:33:37.920 --> 0:33:42.800
or using a direct connection to that person's computer and so if you are in australia and

380
0:33:42.800 --> 0:33:48.800
they're in america then you'll have less of an ability to sync between players if you connect

381
0:33:48.800 --> 0:33:55.360
to the same country you'll have better uh stuff there yeah big red wolfie is one of our australian

382
0:33:55.360 --> 0:34:00.240
players we have quite a few and uh they're just like they've just learned to cope with it

383
0:34:00.240 --> 0:34:04.240
sometimes it depends what's going on as well depends how many people are in the world um

384
0:34:05.440 --> 0:34:09.920
depends how many people are in the world um if like a world gets busy you'll have more and more

385
0:34:09.920 --> 0:34:14.000
sync issues jumping down to it eastern says private doesn't have to get issues that isn't

386
0:34:14.000 --> 0:34:19.760
what i was saying what i was saying is like i gave people advice about how to avoid it um

387
0:34:19.760 --> 0:34:25.760
on the topic of sync issues there is something i need to say which is stop again for the love

388
0:34:25.760 --> 0:34:32.400
of everything stop deleting your local nearest database you can delete your cash that's fine

389
0:34:32.400 --> 0:34:38.480
just stop deleting the local nearest database unless support or something you read tells you to

390
0:34:38.480 --> 0:34:44.320
what i see a lot is people going like x or y didn't work so i you know reinstalled my entire

391
0:34:44.320 --> 0:34:50.240
computer and i i rebuilt the building i live in and i deleted everything and i sold all my worldly

392
0:34:50.240 --> 0:34:54.720
possessions and i moved into the mountains and it still doesn't work and it's like well like the

393
0:34:54.720 --> 0:35:00.240
fix for that wasn't any of that so make sure it's clear that you have gone through prior

394
0:35:00.240 --> 0:35:04.480
debug steps to do it uh there are some sections on the frequently asked questions that do cover

395
0:35:04.480 --> 0:35:09.040
that those do need to be better we just need to write some better ones there uh so jumping back

396
0:35:09.040 --> 0:35:13.680
up now we're away from uh actually electron it says deleting your database can make issues worse

397
0:35:13.680 --> 0:35:19.280
correct it can um in computing there's like a few ways to solve a problem there's fix the problem

398
0:35:19.280 --> 0:35:23.360
which means hey it doesn't reoccur and you learn something there is delete the problem that's

399
0:35:23.360 --> 0:35:27.440
usually where you reinstall the game you reinstall your computer or even when you reboot your computer

400
0:35:27.440 --> 0:35:32.320
when you reboot your computer you're just flushing all the bits back down to to zero not of course on

401
0:35:32.320 --> 0:35:36.160
the you know the hard drive storage but like all of the bits in your cpu all of the bits in your

402
0:35:36.160 --> 0:35:41.200
memory is just like flushed back to zero and so the problem just gets deleted it doesn't get fixed

403
0:35:41.200 --> 0:35:46.720
or you can ignore the problem so your choices are fixed delete or ignore and uh i never want to do

404
0:35:46.720 --> 0:35:51.200
the delete i frequently do the ignore though let's move back to other questions that we got here so

405
0:35:51.200 --> 0:35:54.640
uh actually we'll have to end at the top of the hour so i'm going to try and get through this

406
0:35:54.640 --> 0:36:01.280
quick as i can um so bean says uh thanks that got off there's a train brain treat fair is there a

407
0:36:01.280 --> 0:36:06.080
terrain build a system i can use like a voxel system where i can just dig into the terrain or

408
0:36:06.080 --> 0:36:10.960
add on to it i saw some terrain but i don't know if that was built outside of neos um not to that

409
0:36:10.960 --> 0:36:16.080
level it's not like how some of those like voxel based games um hydrogen air comes to mind we can

410
0:36:16.080 --> 0:36:21.520
just like dig a massive hole or like some of the minecraft inspired games where you can just like

411
0:36:21.520 --> 0:36:27.920
dig more sort of smoother terrain in not like that no but the terrain editor that we do have in game

412
0:36:27.920 --> 0:36:33.840
is uh cool for making just sort of like larger more general structures we're able to say like

413
0:36:33.840 --> 0:36:39.360
here's a hill here's a mountain here's a valley etc but you wouldn't be able to be like i want

414
0:36:39.360 --> 0:36:44.960
the mountain to be in the shape of my favorite dog potato munchkin that that's that you'll need

415
0:36:44.960 --> 0:36:49.040
the outside terrain systems for that and that's because the outside outside terrain systems have

416
0:36:49.040 --> 0:36:54.320
like brushes and you can go in and you can brush onto that terrain with various sets of brushes and

417
0:36:54.320 --> 0:36:58.480
pull things around such that it looks how you want it to look you can sometimes get away with just

418
0:36:58.480 --> 0:37:05.920
like drawing like a height map and to make terrain as well um again then there's like a loss of detail

419
0:37:05.920 --> 0:37:10.400
jelly says that uh they're in a session and someone spawned stuff and it wasn't visible

420
0:37:10.400 --> 0:37:16.160
interactable into almost an hour that's a uh that's a synchronization thing um check your

421
0:37:16.160 --> 0:37:20.240
queued packets there are various ways to do that various uis very spawnable thing even bobs there's

422
0:37:20.240 --> 0:37:26.400
even a logics node for it um queue packets are basically how many messages are waiting on the

423
0:37:26.400 --> 0:37:32.320
server to be delivered to you and if all of your queued packets are zero then that means you are

424
0:37:32.320 --> 0:37:37.680
up to date with the server there's nothing being waited wait waited wait waited being there's

425
0:37:37.680 --> 0:37:43.120
nothing waiting to come down to you there you go take a sentence the right way around uh night

426
0:37:43.120 --> 0:37:48.320
nitrous 96 says i was wondering on the status of the quest to port of neos is um it is in the

427
0:37:48.320 --> 0:37:53.440
android testers channel if you don't have patreon at 12 or more you cannot see it it is a testing

428
0:37:53.440 --> 0:37:58.960
build it is not suitable for mainstream use it crashes about every 45 minutes for various reasons

429
0:37:58.960 --> 0:38:02.960
and if you go into average session on neo she'll probably crash due to the amount of blend shapes

430
0:38:02.960 --> 0:38:07.360
that exist on people's avatars right now um more work needs to happen on it before it become

431
0:38:07.360 --> 0:38:12.240
mainstream and before it can become optimized um that work is not happening right now see the

432
0:38:12.240 --> 0:38:17.760
answers channel um so that's really the state isn't it okay solder has a further expanded the

433
0:38:17.760 --> 0:38:22.000
question totally fine that this that happens just keep on asking the question in different ways

434
0:38:22.000 --> 0:38:26.720
till i actually answer something that makes sense and and we'll get there i apologize for that so

435
0:38:26.720 --> 0:38:30.000
they said that they're making a game and are struggling to sync the game state because there's

436
0:38:30.000 --> 0:38:34.320
almost no documentation about sync what type of stuff would you like to sync so as an example here

437
0:38:34.320 --> 0:38:41.040
if you'd like to sync like ammo on a gun um you might want to sync that locally or something like

438
0:38:41.040 --> 0:38:46.960
that um you need to learn a couple of preset thingies so you would need to learn take a look

439
0:38:46.960 --> 0:38:52.720
at dynamic impulses dynamic variables cloud variables and just logics in general and then

440
0:38:52.720 --> 0:38:57.600
you should know how to sync it isn't something that like you usually need to think about and

441
0:38:57.600 --> 0:39:02.720
that's why there isn't much documentation on it right because you don't usually need to do like

442
0:39:02.720 --> 0:39:06.560
when it comes to game design you don't usually need to do synchronization with neos you just need

443
0:39:06.560 --> 0:39:12.400
to know the tools that are available and build the game around that there is a video i did recently

444
0:39:12.400 --> 0:39:19.680
about mindable ore in a game that will sync across everyone without any additional work

445
0:39:20.560 --> 0:39:24.720
in that mindable or tutorial you have to hit a pickaxe three times into an ore node and it will

446
0:39:24.720 --> 0:39:29.920
drop a piece of ore which is an item none of that has to be synced manually by you uh the moment you

447
0:39:29.920 --> 0:39:35.040
hit it once of a pickaxe every single user provided they're not queued of course will get a message

448
0:39:35.040 --> 0:39:38.400
that you've hit it and that you need to hit it two more times before it comes out like you don't

449
0:39:38.400 --> 0:39:42.960
need to do anything extra there alex has found a skipped question which is fantastic thank you for

450
0:39:42.960 --> 0:39:48.160
doing that um alex uh has pointed to it is there a good guide for explaining layering for worlds

451
0:39:48.160 --> 0:39:54.960
like separation or instancing uh no um be careful when you're doing that like uh if you're doing it

452
0:39:54.960 --> 0:40:01.360
for coloring culling coloring if you don't have color reasons fantastic um uh for culling you

453
0:40:01.360 --> 0:40:06.320
need to keep in mind that people will insist that they need to be in noclip even when they don't

454
0:40:06.320 --> 0:40:10.240
need to be in noclip so you'll have to do some sort of culling system that works in noclip that's

455
0:40:10.240 --> 0:40:13.600
one of the reasons why i haven't documented it because i just disagree with that i'm like if you

456
0:40:13.600 --> 0:40:18.400
need culling you should not be in noclip noclip is called noclip because you don't clip we actually

457
0:40:18.400 --> 0:40:24.480
had a github issue a long time ago just like can you make noclip clip i'm like no no we can't make

458
0:40:24.480 --> 0:40:28.560
no clip clip so by my knowledge there isn't any guide on it uh what you're looking for is culling

459
0:40:28.560 --> 0:40:32.400
system if you ask in other channels in discord for a culling system some people will show you

460
0:40:32.400 --> 0:40:38.400
what they've got nitrous asks uh uh if there's any plans to optimize the game yes optimization

461
0:40:38.400 --> 0:40:42.640
is like always something i'm thinking about but always something everyone else is thinking about

462
0:40:42.640 --> 0:40:46.160
as well that's also why sometimes features don't come out as quickly as you would like

463
0:40:46.160 --> 0:40:49.600
we could quite easily throw out collections tomorrow for example but it would not be

464
0:40:49.600 --> 0:40:56.240
optimized there'd be more key packets um it will be largely and holistically more frustrated than

465
0:40:56.240 --> 0:41:00.320
the lack of collections that's why it doesn't exist um we're always planning on optimizing it

466
0:41:01.120 --> 0:41:06.800
fruits has a list of stuff they just need to do to be more optimized and with that we've reached

467
0:41:06.800 --> 0:41:10.320
the bottom of the questions so i want to do i should have given this at the start but i do

468
0:41:10.320 --> 0:41:15.440
want to give one more message joniel that's still listening here slots do not cause lag

469
0:41:15.440 --> 0:41:21.120
stop proliferating that rumor i will chase you with cat gifs until you stop i was in a several

470
0:41:21.120 --> 0:41:26.240
worlds over the week and people like yeah slots cause they don't slots count the slot count of

471
0:41:26.240 --> 0:41:33.520
an avatar the slot count of an item is a symptom not a cause the symptom is there are a lot of

472
0:41:33.520 --> 0:41:37.520
slots and the reason why there are a lot of slots is because there's too much on that particular

473
0:41:37.520 --> 0:41:42.240
system so if you want to optimize an avatar start by removing systems don't remove slots remove

474
0:41:42.240 --> 0:41:48.160
systems do you need to tell us your favorite cabbage variety above your head in your name

475
0:41:48.160 --> 0:41:52.080
badge do you need to tell me your fps do you need to tell me your battery control level

476
0:41:52.080 --> 0:41:57.360
do you need to tell me that your uh local time do you need to tell me the weather in your location

477
0:41:57.360 --> 0:42:03.360
do you need to do any of that no you don't so remove that remove that before you start removing

478
0:42:03.360 --> 0:42:09.200
slots remove systems do you need a gun at your hip for every single session that you're in no

479
0:42:09.200 --> 0:42:17.040
remove that do you need um do you need a custom inspector parented to your avatar no spawn it in

480
0:42:17.040 --> 0:42:23.360
with the tool when you need to do build let's move uh so yeah just just think about like it's it's

481
0:42:23.360 --> 0:42:29.120
like a it's like a stacked order of things because like electronics points out like shifty has said

482
0:42:29.120 --> 0:42:36.400
the uh slot transforms due to ik cause some lag yes they do cause some lag but not compared to

483
0:42:36.400 --> 0:42:42.480
the like a million systems that are on your avatar that you don't need like it's all relative right

484
0:42:42.480 --> 0:42:48.080
so think about what you're loading into the world before you think about how many slots it has

485
0:42:48.080 --> 0:42:52.400
because like the slots are just a symptom right if it's a complicated system it's going to have

486
0:42:52.400 --> 0:42:57.600
a lot of slots and if it's complicated it's probably causing lag by itself and doesn't need

487
0:42:57.600 --> 0:43:03.600
to care about the slot count like i could probably rig up a 1 million slot thing that has the same

488
0:43:03.600 --> 0:43:09.600
that has the same performance as like one rex avatar it's not slots moving uh forwards for the

489
0:43:09.600 --> 0:43:16.000
last few questions uh cloud cloud support says uh your vision aware virtual worlds building and

490
0:43:16.000 --> 0:43:21.680
hanging out and special communities are i don't quite understand the question i don't personally

491
0:43:21.680 --> 0:43:28.640
have a vision there i just want to enable people to like build cool shit and that's the the vision

492
0:43:28.640 --> 0:43:33.120
i know that's a poor answer but like it's difficult to answer that one unless there's

493
0:43:33.120 --> 0:43:37.280
more specificity about what's going on just notice that you've clarified some specificity

494
0:43:38.800 --> 0:43:43.600
specificity there by saying curious about where things are headed uh you can see our roadmap that's

495
0:43:43.600 --> 0:43:47.680
on the github which has all the sort of features that we're looking for and stuff like that uh

496
0:43:47.680 --> 0:43:51.680
aside from those features the general goal is to just enable you guys to create more and more stuff

497
0:43:51.680 --> 0:43:56.720
with more and more tools more and more abilities and to be more optimized and easier to use so

498
0:43:56.720 --> 0:44:04.720
that's our like forward progression okay moving forwards to nitrous's next question um how do i

499
0:44:04.720 --> 0:44:09.680
go about completely wiping my home worlds because i messed up and now have a giant miku that i can't

500
0:44:09.680 --> 0:44:16.080
delete uh you can delete that open up the um inspector and just go through each item in the

501
0:44:16.080 --> 0:44:20.080
inspector and you'll find the miku and you can delete it you can reset those home worlds but

502
0:44:20.080 --> 0:44:23.840
it'll be a lot easier to just go through the inspector and find that miku and you also learn

503
0:44:23.840 --> 0:44:29.760
about how to do that process for next time that happens um i don't know if anyone in here was

504
0:44:29.760 --> 0:44:36.240
aware it was around we were in uh raivi's nest world and uh i noticed in the middle of spawn

505
0:44:36.240 --> 0:44:42.080
was a single flame badge and siro then spent like 30 minutes trying to figure out where that flame

506
0:44:42.080 --> 0:44:48.160
badge was and we eventually got there like we eventually found it it was a null parented slot

507
0:44:48.160 --> 0:44:53.120
which sometimes does happen it's a bug and it's problematic uh and then uh actually so nitro has

508
0:44:53.120 --> 0:44:57.280
a second question which is i've seen people with custom menus of different sounds what mod is that

509
0:44:57.280 --> 0:45:02.720
that's not a mod um that's another thing like i like like the policy like i wrote the policy on

510
0:45:02.720 --> 0:45:07.440
modding the modern community are fantastic if there's one thing i could say and you know you're

511
0:45:07.440 --> 0:45:12.880
entitled to go do your own research etc it's stop looking for mods when you initially join the game

512
0:45:12.880 --> 0:45:17.360
learn about our existing features before you go look for mods like we had someone in the modding

513
0:45:17.360 --> 0:45:22.640
discord the other day asking for a mod to enable flying and it's like that's just part of neos you

514
0:45:22.640 --> 0:45:29.600
can just fly you don't need a mod for that and so again for um custom menus of different sounds you

515
0:45:29.600 --> 0:45:34.400
don't need a mod for that you just build it um when building those things do keep in mind that

516
0:45:34.400 --> 0:45:39.040
some users myself included are sound sensitive and that we don't care when you open up your context

517
0:45:39.040 --> 0:45:43.680
menu and so if you should for example use kingdom hearts sound effects from the menu noises of

518
0:45:43.680 --> 0:45:50.160
kingdom hearts on the global audio channel at 150 volume every time you open your context menu

519
0:45:50.160 --> 0:45:55.760
i'm likely to kick you from my world it is like no offense like i don't i'm not angry of you

520
0:45:55.760 --> 0:46:00.400
i just don't want to hear kingdom hearts music menu every time you open your context menu so

521
0:46:00.400 --> 0:46:06.320
don't do that maybe play it locally and maybe make it situational if it's locally actually i

522
0:46:06.320 --> 0:46:14.160
don't care but like if it's not local make it situational and make it sound reasonable

523
0:46:14.160 --> 0:46:20.160
well now you open up a context menu i don't want to hear the entire halo soundtrack you know the

524
0:46:20.160 --> 0:46:26.160
choral like r's and o's from the main soundtrack don't need that don't know why anyone does please

525
0:46:26.160 --> 0:46:29.120
don't do it okay i'm going to go through these really really quick i do have to go at the behalf

526
0:46:29.120 --> 0:46:35.360
as i said um electronicis ought to know about more slot transforms what exactly is that and what be

527
0:46:35.360 --> 0:46:39.440
the way to minimize that that's about calculating where our slot is relative to another slot so i

528
0:46:39.440 --> 0:46:44.000
don't know and i'm not going to give out false information so i don't know but i would think

529
0:46:44.000 --> 0:46:49.840
theoretically theoretically say the um parenting logic systems to the top of your avatar would

530
0:46:49.840 --> 0:46:54.640
probably be best as there are low less transforms there but again it's not about slots just just

531
0:46:54.640 --> 0:47:00.320
reiterating that it's just like uh an idea shark says when you talk about slots but you meet the

532
0:47:00.320 --> 0:47:03.920
do you mean by slots every clothing option reduces performance even if it's not in use

533
0:47:03.920 --> 0:47:08.880
uh slot you if you're familiar with unity vr chat stuff like that slot is basically an empty game

534
0:47:08.880 --> 0:47:12.480
object it's anything with a transform anything in the hierarchy that appears on the left side of

535
0:47:12.480 --> 0:47:18.320
ninos of unity uh over in unity it's called game object over here it's called slots it's basically

536
0:47:18.320 --> 0:47:23.280
just like a position a rotation and a scale of which things can be attached to including other

537
0:47:23.280 --> 0:47:29.280
slots um so you want to keep that count low but you want to look at other stuff before you worry

538
0:47:29.280 --> 0:47:36.160
about slot count so if you're like yes my avatar is 800 slots but it also has like 50 000 logics

539
0:47:36.160 --> 0:47:40.880
nodes on it talking to a web socket server so i can see the uh temperature of your hamster's

540
0:47:40.880 --> 0:47:46.560
rear end that's probably what's causing lag and not the slots uh so that says what's the best and

541
0:47:46.560 --> 0:47:51.520
most optimized way to do quaternion look rotations uh check the components we have uh transform

542
0:47:51.520 --> 0:47:55.600
drivers look at look at user and auto look at user i don't know the difference between all those

543
0:47:55.600 --> 0:47:59.520
three i just pick one and mess with it till it works and if it doesn't work i'll load the other

544
0:47:59.520 --> 0:48:03.520
ones and take a look at those those are the best ways to do it because those are the simplest ways

545
0:48:03.520 --> 0:48:06.320
you don't have to do any of the maths yourself you just put in some details and it'll do the

546
0:48:06.320 --> 0:48:11.040
look rotation for you we also have in logics we have math rotation and then there is look

547
0:48:11.040 --> 0:48:16.160
rotation as a node which would work in a similar way to how the unity function would work if you're

548
0:48:16.160 --> 0:48:21.040
familiar with that one i used that one the other day both of those are as optimized as we can get

549
0:48:21.040 --> 0:48:26.320
them uh so use those don't wherever possible see if there's a node that does the mathematical

550
0:48:26.320 --> 0:48:31.520
calculation for you because in those aspects we're able to optimize it for you basement says

551
0:48:31.520 --> 0:48:35.840
what's wrong with the entire helo centric the helo centric is fantastic someone opening their

552
0:48:35.840 --> 0:48:41.280
context menu and then a halo spawning around it the halo from halo and then the the coral

553
0:48:41.280 --> 0:48:46.640
main track going off whilst they fumble around with equipping a tool and then close it again

554
0:48:47.280 --> 0:48:52.880
not cool uh aaron says that that's not an actual question great skipping it uh no more questions

555
0:48:52.880 --> 0:48:58.400
after aaron i gotta run it's it's getting late but i'll get uh olaf's and i'll get nate's uh

556
0:48:58.400 --> 0:49:02.640
olaf says which trial subjects are planned to cover in the near future i don't know i had the

557
0:49:02.640 --> 0:49:08.400
covid booster yesterday and i'm alternating between shivering and boiling everyone's like

558
0:49:08.400 --> 0:49:13.840
you should skip office hours and i'm like no i've been doing office hours like every week for a solid

559
0:49:13.840 --> 0:49:21.200
like year i'm not losing my streak uh so i don't know today maybe some tara who knows i want to do

560
0:49:21.200 --> 0:49:26.720
um like i said i want to do random object spawner and i want to do a few on stuff which i just i

561
0:49:26.720 --> 0:49:33.680
just see questioned and aren't covered that may involve some of the um the walking animation stuff

562
0:49:33.680 --> 0:49:38.880
etc but like it basically is like when i start recording is what i feel like it used to be i

563
0:49:38.880 --> 0:49:42.240
could do like i knew i was planning out because i hadn't done tutorials and everything but now

564
0:49:42.240 --> 0:49:47.760
it's harder and harder to find something that i like go yep i can do that um nate wrench says

565
0:49:47.760 --> 0:49:53.680
can we filter uh worlds that have potato modes uh yes if you would like to contact a user that

566
0:49:53.680 --> 0:49:59.440
has a potato mode in their world and ask them to add the potato tag to their world tags then you'll

567
0:49:59.440 --> 0:50:03.360
be able to search for worlds by the potato tag and then you'll be able to find worlds that have the

568
0:50:03.360 --> 0:50:07.520
potato modes uh worlds can have tags tags are very powerful make sure that your worlds have

569
0:50:07.520 --> 0:50:10.880
appropriate tags if your world is a game make sure it has the game tag give us a piece of art make

570
0:50:10.880 --> 0:50:16.240
sure it's the art tag uh i split shots when is the office house hosted each week um i will post

571
0:50:16.240 --> 0:50:21.200
a wiki link in just a moment and uh my last final message before i go because i really don't have to

572
0:50:21.200 --> 0:50:26.480
run is make tickets if someone is bad to you in a session if they harass you if there's a problem

573
0:50:26.480 --> 0:50:31.920
if you want to get someone banned because you don't like them moderation.neos.com we won't

574
0:50:31.920 --> 0:50:38.000
penalize you for invalid tickets we would rather hear about it moderation.neos.com best way to get

575
0:50:38.000 --> 0:50:52.160
in touch with moderation fastest way to get in touch with moderation thank you and goodbye
