1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.320
All right, welcome to office hours. It is 4 p.m. So we'll go ahead and start if you have

2
0:00:05.040 --> 0:00:08.840
Any questions, please drop them in text a channel and I'll get to them as soon as I can

3
0:00:08.880 --> 0:00:13.360
We are recording but their recording levels are showing is really low for some reason, but I hope it's good

4
0:00:13.360 --> 0:00:17.280
I mean like the the monitor on on audacity says it's good. So that's cool

5
0:00:17.280 --> 0:00:21.680
If not, I'll just boost it there any issues in audio. Let me know. I did tweak things the other day

6
0:00:21.680 --> 0:00:27.840
Oh, thank you. Lex like put some questions into the form. I do sometimes forget to perform this to me. I can lost a cough

7
0:00:27.840 --> 0:00:32.960
Okay, we're done coughing. I can go ahead and look at that form. Oh, there is a lot of questions

8
0:00:32.960 --> 0:00:37.960
That's a question for moderation. So I will go ahead and put that here Sunday. Whatever they do. Anyway, um

9
0:00:38.720 --> 0:00:40.720
Okay, two questions from Lex. Lex says

10
0:00:42.240 --> 0:00:48.360
How should we go about documenting legacy features or features that used to be inside Neos should documentation include when the feature was deprecated?

11
0:00:48.360 --> 0:00:50.360
And what was placed for us all superseded with?

12
0:00:50.880 --> 0:00:54.680
Yes, you should document them if you'd like to if it's removed entirely

13
0:00:54.680 --> 0:00:59.400
There's not really like a need to but if you want to for historical purposes, go ahead and go for it

14
0:00:59.760 --> 0:01:04.360
You can like put a notice on the page that says it's deprecated. Yes, lots of coughing today

15
0:01:06.520 --> 0:01:11.320
But notice on the page that is deprecated usually a wiki would have a template like

16
0:01:11.480 --> 0:01:14.360
Deprecate which would then put like the same consistent banner on them

17
0:01:14.360 --> 0:01:16.520
I don't know if we got one and then check it up there

18
0:01:16.520 --> 0:01:18.240
The only thing that comes to mind that we you know

19
0:01:18.240 --> 0:01:21.680
Might want to document is the legacy of the sphere detector cuz that was such a cool node

20
0:01:21.680 --> 0:01:28.480
Which is entirely not performant not performant like don't use I mean you can't now but even when it was there don't very bad

21
0:01:28.480 --> 0:01:34.100
Um for that question on to the second question, which is would be good idea to document update logs on the wiki

22
0:01:34.100 --> 0:01:36.440
Yes, there was actually a lot of update logs done

23
0:01:36.960 --> 0:01:42.960
on bit man Bob was a hotel room or something and they didn't really have much to do and so they decided to

24
0:01:44.640 --> 0:01:48.140
They decided to just do that for lots of the updates on there

25
0:01:48.140 --> 0:01:51.120
So there is a page somewhere on the wiki that has a lot of the updates

26
0:01:51.120 --> 0:01:54.720
Um bit man didn't keep that up-to-date with the the changing times

27
0:01:54.720 --> 0:01:58.260
But we have an ample opportunity to make that up to coming up me updates for a while

28
0:01:58.260 --> 0:02:03.080
So go for it. If you'd like to just find the old page copy the formatting go for it

29
0:02:03.080 --> 0:02:08.840
So that is the the questions on just got a new tape to the date that I did those at those

30
0:02:08.840 --> 0:02:14.520
It's already uh, it's already July, you know, I remember it being in January and I always have that feeling in January

31
0:02:14.520 --> 0:02:16.820
I'm just like this year's gonna be so long and it's just like ah

32
0:02:17.440 --> 0:02:19.440
Nope, it's it's it's July

33
0:02:19.440 --> 0:02:20.520
Haha

34
0:02:20.520 --> 0:02:23.360
Aaron this what did the sphere detector do and

35
0:02:23.640 --> 0:02:29.520
What should we do in place of the sphere detector was an active sphere collider that existed in the world?

36
0:02:29.520 --> 0:02:32.960
Like it was the only node that did this it had like a visual world

37
0:02:33.240 --> 0:02:36.820
representation at a circle that would be in the world of and anything that was placed

38
0:02:37.200 --> 0:02:41.280
Inside that sphere or touched that sphere would then cause an event coming out of the actor node

39
0:02:42.080 --> 0:02:44.080
it's bad because

40
0:02:44.120 --> 0:02:47.200
It wasn't really clear what happened if you pack it like if you pack it

41
0:02:47.200 --> 0:02:50.760
I didn't think it would work, but it might have left that sphere collider there

42
0:02:51.080 --> 0:02:56.760
What you should use in in place of that is colliders that are set up for your particular kitchen

43
0:02:57.560 --> 0:03:03.540
Active colliders are totally fine. Active mesh colliders are not fine. See my video tutorial series on colliders for more information

44
0:03:03.720 --> 0:03:10.520
I still regularly hear people say that active colliders are bad and should be avoided. No go away

45
0:03:10.840 --> 0:03:16.200
A good example here, which I always give is imagine that you are mining so you're doing you know

46
0:03:16.200 --> 0:03:20.240
Like mining you name it RPG mining you have a pickaxe

47
0:03:20.240 --> 0:03:24.400
There is an ore vein in front of you. You want to whack it with the pickaxe?

48
0:03:24.720 --> 0:03:31.080
some people were like doing crazy stuff like I'm gonna shoot raycasts at the tip of the pickaxe and

49
0:03:31.680 --> 0:03:34.720
Detect if they hit the ore vein and then based on the distance

50
0:03:34.720 --> 0:03:40.140
I know if you're actually hitting it just like what what you're doing there is basically emulating colliders instead

51
0:03:40.140 --> 0:03:43.160
What you should do is place a small sphere collider

52
0:03:43.160 --> 0:03:46.480
Or capsule capsule might be better depending on the gameplay

53
0:03:46.480 --> 0:03:51.560
You're going for on the tip of the pickaxe that is only active when the pickaxe is being held

54
0:03:51.560 --> 0:03:55.100
So let's say it's on your back because it's like back equipped or on the floor

55
0:03:55.200 --> 0:04:02.060
that collider isn't active or maybe you can detect hey there in the mind and when that sphere collider that's active collides with the

56
0:04:03.160 --> 0:04:05.600
Collider of the of the ore you could be like cool

57
0:04:05.600 --> 0:04:09.500
They hit the ore and then you can count the hits or make noises whatever you want to do

58
0:04:09.500 --> 0:04:14.060
Perfectly fine to use an active collider there. In fact, I don't really know how you do it other than you know

59
0:04:14.060 --> 0:04:16.060
I'm gonna shoot raycasts out the

60
0:04:16.860 --> 0:04:23.700
Collider the pickaxe which is essentially what colliders do colliders in a lot of cases are like actually raycast for sphere colliders

61
0:04:23.700 --> 0:04:25.700
Which are the most efficient colliders that are out there?

62
0:04:26.820 --> 0:04:31.020
They do like overlap sphere these which should we just tutorial that pickaxe

63
0:04:31.660 --> 0:04:35.140
Example, I keep giving people can see it. You can see an example of it in

64
0:04:35.140 --> 0:04:39.700
One of the recent creator gems is the one about bread called carb jam or something

65
0:04:40.820 --> 0:04:47.900
Everyone was making this sort of bread stuff. There was a user a Japanese user cannot remember their name fantastic job, whoever you are

66
0:04:47.900 --> 0:04:50.860
I'm sorry name. They made this bread

67
0:04:51.460 --> 0:04:58.420
Kneading thing you go up into an oven and you can like pull out some flour add some water and then you actually need it

68
0:04:58.420 --> 0:05:03.580
It's just like shape keys that like distort this sort of oval of bread when you're like putting your hands on it

69
0:05:03.580 --> 0:05:07.500
It feels kind of good and then you can cook the bread. I'm like, well, where are they getting the flour from?

70
0:05:07.500 --> 0:05:12.540
That's why I made this like farming game a really mean one where you can grow

71
0:05:13.300 --> 0:05:16.500
You can grow wheat. It's all very basic because it's create a gem

72
0:05:16.500 --> 0:05:19.820
So I just used you know free assets that didn't really bother what it looks

73
0:05:19.820 --> 0:05:25.740
But once a single crop of wheat is grown you use a scythe to harvest it and that does the active collider thing

74
0:05:25.740 --> 0:05:31.180
I basically turn on the anti-collider when you're holding the scythe if it hits a fully grown wheat column

75
0:05:31.180 --> 0:05:34.540
It will delete the wheat column replace it with a wheat bale

76
0:05:34.780 --> 0:05:40.020
Grind that now before you say I know that's not how flour is made, but this is a video game

77
0:05:40.020 --> 0:05:45.220
We were making it simple because of course in wheat you want to separate like the top of the plant from the store

78
0:05:45.220 --> 0:05:51.160
That's why windmills exist as they did it more automatically for you. Those are the questions we have right now

79
0:05:51.160 --> 0:05:55.760
I know I was what you're not about wheat and farming for a long time. So if you have any of those you

80
0:05:55.760 --> 0:05:59.540
Oh, I love rumors. So we have a rumor from electronics. Let me go ahead and read this out

81
0:05:59.540 --> 0:06:06.580
So electronic says there is a rumor that you cannot add touch tips or only add partial connection touch tips to your avatar for security reasons

82
0:06:06.580 --> 0:06:09.980
However, in my and some of the users testing they work for all kind of buttons

83
0:06:09.980 --> 0:06:11.820
But it seems you just need hand data component

84
0:06:11.820 --> 0:06:20.140
Um, there is a flow which will disable a touch tip that you add based on a couple of sort of patterns or something like that

85
0:06:20.260 --> 0:06:25.940
This isn't a rumor by the way, like when everyone's like, oh, there's a rumor that like well bad stinky poo-poo thing

86
0:06:25.940 --> 0:06:33.380
I'm like, that's not a rumor like that's documented behavior that exists as a feature. Anyway, what I'm saying is if you add a touch tip to

87
0:06:34.220 --> 0:06:36.500
Another area on rabbit are there is a way to make it work

88
0:06:37.020 --> 0:06:42.340
But touch tips will have basically like a safety switch in them that will be tripped very very quickly

89
0:06:42.860 --> 0:06:44.860
That prevents it from being used

90
0:06:45.500 --> 0:06:47.900
Remember in the exact qualifications there

91
0:06:47.900 --> 0:06:51.220
I don't think I should give those out because then there's easy ways to get around it

92
0:06:51.220 --> 0:06:56.460
But the security preventative measure on those touch tips and the way that that works you can thank me for that

93
0:06:56.540 --> 0:07:01.140
Like I am the one who found that bug a long time ago, and that's how mr

94
0:07:01.140 --> 0:07:05.700
fruit I was looking to try and export a text file from a

95
0:07:05.900 --> 0:07:11.780
scientific experiment and I figured out that if you added a touch tip and a button you could kind of fake it and then you

96
0:07:11.780 --> 0:07:17.020
Could arbitrarily write files to someone's computer and I giggled for a bit and then immediately reported it. I think my

97
0:07:17.860 --> 0:07:19.380
directions for

98
0:07:19.380 --> 0:07:24.020
Making touch tips work like I know some people want them on their feet or their nose, etc

99
0:07:25.460 --> 0:07:26.620
but

100
0:07:26.620 --> 0:07:30.980
you need to add the hand component the touch tip component and then

101
0:07:32.260 --> 0:07:35.300
Save and re-equip the avatar and that should but it should hook it together

102
0:07:35.820 --> 0:07:41.640
If it basically like if that component if a hand component or the the touch it component see something fishy

103
0:07:41.640 --> 0:07:47.820
Then they'll just like disable themselves and then she'd like re-load the object cetera. Yeah, I'm getting kind of like sick of like

104
0:07:47.820 --> 0:07:54.060
Oh, there's a rumor like our space. We're here. That's what here for there's a rumor that Neos is doing Bitcoin mining

105
0:07:54.180 --> 0:07:57.900
We're not like you can actually check. Yeah, it's good. It's not your fault that Tron is

106
0:07:57.900 --> 0:07:59.500
It's just like the way society works

107
0:07:59.500 --> 0:08:03.380
Especially the way a community works in a game like this which are that many updates recently

108
0:08:03.380 --> 0:08:07.940
I heard this Bob heard this Janice at the circle circle circle a little bit of telephone

109
0:08:08.700 --> 0:08:12.700
And you end up with stuff like that back in my day would call that game Chinese whispers

110
0:08:12.700 --> 0:08:17.540
That's where my children would sit in a circle and then some person would come up with something and then they'd whisper it around

111
0:08:17.540 --> 0:08:20.820
In a circle and come back and it would usually get distorted

112
0:08:20.820 --> 0:08:24.980
I feel like that drawing game where you handed like a drawing around and say redraw it

113
0:08:24.980 --> 0:08:27.380
So, you know, I would get a card that said

114
0:08:28.020 --> 0:08:33.540
Monkey with a banana I would draw it and someone else might see that as like monkey of a microphone and it goes round

115
0:08:33.540 --> 0:08:33.940
Yeah

116
0:08:33.940 --> 0:08:38.620
We you I say we used to call it Chinese whispers because I was informed a few years back that we don't call it that

117
0:08:38.620 --> 0:08:43.860
Any children call that a game of telephone and use that as a corporate phrase now as well when when there's a misunderstanding

118
0:08:43.860 --> 0:08:50.140
As it goes through like multiple layers of like corporate hierarchy, we call that a telephone game, you know

119
0:08:50.140 --> 0:08:52.620
Maybe like my manager's manager would be like hey

120
0:08:52.620 --> 0:08:56.820
We need to get this done and he says are this done and then I'm talking to someone to try and get it done

121
0:08:57.020 --> 0:09:01.700
Yeah, it's crazy. Anyway, so now I've got a game of telephone. Yeah, I've heard both too like this

122
0:09:01.700 --> 0:09:03.700
I'm just I'm just very interested. I

123
0:09:04.500 --> 0:09:07.260
There are a bunch of terms that where I work which are

124
0:09:07.780 --> 0:09:11.140
You know on a list and those lists are like instead of saying this say this

125
0:09:11.140 --> 0:09:14.540
so you'll have seen that github recently changed the

126
0:09:15.740 --> 0:09:21.900
Main branch that is used that's like the main development drunch. They changed it from being called master to being called main

127
0:09:22.900 --> 0:09:23.900
and

128
0:09:23.900 --> 0:09:29.220
the term like whitelist and blacklist is like avoided usually now we use allow list or

129
0:09:29.860 --> 0:09:31.860
denialist or

130
0:09:31.860 --> 0:09:36.740
As a friend wants to call it the no-no list and the yeah. Yeah list, which I think is amazing

131
0:09:36.820 --> 0:09:38.820
You don't want to be on my no-no list

132
0:09:38.820 --> 0:09:40.820
No-no list

133
0:09:41.140 --> 0:09:45.420
Anyway other questions so Kyra says bring a good question from elsewhere

134
0:09:46.060 --> 0:09:50.940
What's the reason behind me as having multiple cache locations for data for download assets or whatever the terminology is used?

135
0:09:50.940 --> 0:09:52.540
There aren't actually two

136
0:09:52.540 --> 0:09:58.500
Cache location the important thing to note here is and I'm gonna do a preamble here, which is completely off track of your question

137
0:09:58.500 --> 0:10:02.340
I know stop deleting your data location

138
0:10:02.340 --> 0:10:03.460
You can delete your cache

139
0:10:03.460 --> 0:10:08.260
However, you want stop deleting your data location and stop deleting both of those to fix a problem

140
0:10:08.260 --> 0:10:12.860
Like the one reason I allow you to delete your cache is if it's getting too big and you need hard drive space

141
0:10:12.860 --> 0:10:18.580
That's like the one reason you need to people like oh, no, my knee has crashed once today

142
0:10:18.580 --> 0:10:23.660
I will delete everything and reinstall the game. Please don't do that. Doesn't help me out doesn't help anyone out

143
0:10:23.660 --> 0:10:27.860
I have no idea what's going on. Stop doing it. Just follow the troubleshooting steps

144
0:10:27.860 --> 0:10:32.420
We have which mostly is asking questions and help and you'll see no one in there is like believe your gosh

145
0:10:32.740 --> 0:10:37.580
Sometimes you need to and that's why it becomes a sort of like a solution people like maybe that

146
0:10:37.580 --> 0:10:42.060
But that's usually once we've done a bunch of other steps to see if we can get away without doing it

147
0:10:42.060 --> 0:10:44.060
But on to the actual question, there are two locations

148
0:10:44.060 --> 0:10:49.580
There is the cache the cache will store downloaded files from an assets from assets and stuff like that

149
0:10:49.580 --> 0:10:54.420
So if you go to my world and in my world, there's a model and textures of a cheese sandwich

150
0:10:54.940 --> 0:10:56.340
That's downloaded to your cache

151
0:10:56.340 --> 0:10:59.060
The reason it does that is so that like hey if you go back to that world

152
0:10:59.060 --> 0:11:01.380
Do you see that I am again? You don't need to redownload that

153
0:11:01.380 --> 0:11:06.540
Information from me is cloud you have in your computer. You can just load it. That's the cache

154
0:11:06.540 --> 0:11:09.940
the secondary location is the data folder which has a

155
0:11:11.060 --> 0:11:18.220
Database in it and a bunch of other stuff and also has anything stored locally if you store anything in your local home

156
0:11:18.260 --> 0:11:22.620
Both worlds and items they are stored literally in that folder

157
0:11:22.620 --> 0:11:29.900
And so by deleting that you're deleting basically everything Neos knows about you and any items that you have stored locally

158
0:11:29.900 --> 0:11:35.820
That's why I say don't do it also stored in that location is like the local copy of some of your stuff

159
0:11:35.820 --> 0:11:37.420
That's like to do a syncing etc

160
0:11:37.420 --> 0:11:43.380
So when you delete that you may lose progress, but you sometimes need to delete that when there are syncing issues

161
0:11:43.380 --> 0:11:46.420
But that's after you have tried the sync

162
0:11:47.060 --> 0:11:51.780
Resolution commands which will fix the syncing people are too willy-nilly to delete essentially

163
0:11:51.780 --> 0:11:55.980
That's the to locate you've got cache which is like I'm gonna air quotes this because it's a little wishy-washy

164
0:11:55.980 --> 0:12:02.740
But like other people's stuff is the cache right other people's worlds other people's items other people's crap

165
0:12:02.740 --> 0:12:06.160
And then the data location which is your stuff

166
0:12:06.160 --> 0:12:10.820
I mean it like I said it can go between those is like a Venn diagram, but it's like your stuff

167
0:12:10.820 --> 0:12:15.000
So your items your worlds the stuff stored locally your database

168
0:12:15.000 --> 0:12:19.660
Which is basically like a lookup table for everything is if you know like index cards in a library

169
0:12:19.660 --> 0:12:24.980
That's what they did as well as settings and things like that are also stored. So those are those two locations

170
0:12:24.980 --> 0:12:31.120
they are stored in different places because the Windows file system encourages us to do so everyone is aware of the

171
0:12:31.580 --> 0:12:34.500
temporary folders those are known and

172
0:12:34.980 --> 0:12:40.060
Windows and other tools know that temporary folders exist there and that they can be cleared

173
0:12:40.060 --> 0:12:43.260
That's there is a temp directory on other operating systems

174
0:12:43.260 --> 0:12:47.960
And it's just known that like hey if you need to you can trash the temp folder

175
0:12:47.960 --> 0:12:52.220
That's what that is you so believe that's that question if you have any follow-up questions. Do let me know we'll get to it

176
0:12:52.220 --> 0:12:58.180
Electron says deleting the database makes it harder to help. That's correct the easiest way to help you is to give us log files

177
0:12:58.180 --> 0:13:03.500
Give us log files sometimes the log files don't actually say anything and if the log files don't say anything actionable

178
0:13:03.500 --> 0:13:05.500
That's where it might become

179
0:13:05.660 --> 0:13:09.420
Suitable to delete your cash and stuff like that usually I remember a friend of mine

180
0:13:09.900 --> 0:13:15.340
they bought an oculus headset like the CD one long long time ago 2019 or whatever and

181
0:13:16.500 --> 0:13:20.560
Saying 2019 was a long time ago. It makes me feel strange anyway

182
0:13:20.560 --> 0:13:25.560
And they just couldn't get it working and they were talking to support and support were doing everything

183
0:13:25.840 --> 0:13:31.520
In a diagnostic cetera and it turned up to like they were then like after like a couple of like back and forth

184
0:13:31.520 --> 0:13:35.160
It was okay now try reinstalling which he did it didn't and then they were like hey

185
0:13:35.520 --> 0:13:38.340
Try reinstalling windows that might fix it

186
0:13:38.340 --> 0:13:44.700
And he actually did and I told him no like if a support person tells you to reinstall windows because their software is wrong

187
0:13:45.000 --> 0:13:47.000
Nope, nope

188
0:13:47.000 --> 0:13:50.700
Mm-hmm windows should be nothing to do that there are things that can happen of course

189
0:13:50.700 --> 0:13:52.720
But like they should know about those things anyway

190
0:13:52.720 --> 0:13:58.800
So we did reinstall windows and it didn't work and the support our person was then like could you reinstall windows again?

191
0:13:58.800 --> 0:14:01.640
And at that point he returned the oculus headset and went for a vive

192
0:14:01.640 --> 0:14:04.160
Oh, I have another question here from electronic who asks

193
0:14:04.160 --> 0:14:09.360
Oh, I have seen a couple of log files talking about not being able to find local files to sync

194
0:14:09.360 --> 0:14:14.040
I assume those messing with the fault yes, so when you mess with the folder particularly if you do it in a certain way

195
0:14:14.040 --> 0:14:18.240
Which is something I've always seen people do they like to leak like half their local folders or whatever

196
0:14:18.760 --> 0:14:22.480
We end up with is sort of like a referential thing so again if we think about light

197
0:14:22.640 --> 0:14:27.900
Indexed cars at a library you go to the indexer to look at specially index cars are because or computers

198
0:14:28.560 --> 0:14:33.840
Before there are computers which told you where a library book was or you know before computers where you you needed a books

199
0:14:34.500 --> 0:14:37.340
You would go to the library and you'd go to like an indexer

200
0:14:37.340 --> 0:14:41.880
Which is like a big collection of cards and you would stop like sift through those cards and pick one up

201
0:14:41.880 --> 0:14:46.920
And it'd be like ah yes primes cheese recipes and it's in aisle four row two

202
0:14:46.920 --> 0:14:49.000
And then you know exactly where it is to go fine

203
0:14:49.400 --> 0:14:52.800
So now imagine that you went to the indexer you look for the card

204
0:14:52.800 --> 0:14:59.200
Then you went to grow whatever I said, and it wasn't there the books not there that means that there is a

205
0:15:00.120 --> 0:15:05.760
Can't find that file, and that's what the library in ages like I don't I don't think I'll need another reference

206
0:15:05.760 --> 0:15:09.600
But like you know at school you always had reference books sometimes you had to buy them sometimes school

207
0:15:09.600 --> 0:15:13.440
Would just like you know have a collection of them which they passed out and most of those had graffiti in them

208
0:15:13.440 --> 0:15:18.400
But you know like I think I need one back in the day. I bought actually still have them

209
0:15:18.400 --> 0:15:20.800
I've got like four books on pearl because pearl is the language I

210
0:15:21.000 --> 0:15:27.200
Learned to get start in this like industry and so I have like all the pearl books you can have and I haven't touched them

211
0:15:27.200 --> 0:15:31.000
Ever I wanted to learn like a new language now. Let's say like rust or stuff

212
0:15:31.000 --> 0:15:34.800
I wouldn't need a book like I don't think I'm gonna buy another like reference the only books

213
0:15:34.800 --> 0:15:38.440
I think I'll be buying is like none. Those are all the questions on the list so

214
0:15:38.440 --> 0:15:43.600
If you have more questions do let us know otherwise. I will be sat here in other exciting news

215
0:15:43.600 --> 0:15:47.120
I have a laser level arriving. I bought a

216
0:15:47.800 --> 0:15:50.840
What's a picture to go above my couch?

217
0:15:50.840 --> 0:15:56.480
I always hang paint like how can it because I'm in a rental I use the command strip which don't damage the arm

218
0:15:56.480 --> 0:15:59.120
But for those to work and for you to hang a picture straight

219
0:15:59.120 --> 0:16:03.760
You need the command strips to be straight the command strips on the back of the actual painting be straight

220
0:16:03.760 --> 0:16:08.880
I hand them to be put on the wall straight. I'm done so I get to play of that if there any other questions

221
0:16:08.880 --> 0:16:13.320
Please drop them through you got about eight minutes before I vanish and turn into a pumpkin. I do have a random

222
0:16:14.000 --> 0:16:19.360
Good life pro tip or message check your subscriptions if there is money coming out of your bank account

223
0:16:19.640 --> 0:16:23.880
Monthly add it up and figure out if you use like I found I thought I'd cancelled it

224
0:16:23.880 --> 0:16:28.280
But I found that I was accidentally still still subscribed to uber one

225
0:16:28.280 --> 0:16:32.480
I was using uber one to get better deals on uber eats, but now I'm trying to

226
0:16:32.480 --> 0:16:39.720
Avoid uber eats, so I'm like okay. Let's cancel uber one then that was ten dollars coming out of my month bank account every month

227
0:16:39.720 --> 0:16:44.320
I could put back into so so check that account check your statement. I had one the other day

228
0:16:44.320 --> 0:16:47.440
I didn't recognize I googled it, and I'm like oh, that's my home insurance

229
0:16:47.440 --> 0:16:52.240
Okay, my home insurance company changed name, and I so electronus has provided a picture of the log file

230
0:16:52.840 --> 0:16:55.120
Yeah, that's exactly what you're talking about

231
0:16:55.120 --> 0:16:59.660
Yeah, that is basically like cannot locate that well so here if you're poking around in your local files

232
0:16:59.660 --> 0:17:03.360
And you know trying to sort of see how they work. It's a true keep in mind that they are

233
0:17:03.840 --> 0:17:08.700
Like not encrypted because it's like really weak you can like figure it out, but like they're a little bit like

234
0:17:09.320 --> 0:17:10.640
Obstificated I guess

235
0:17:10.640 --> 0:17:14.280
Some of that is optimization some of that is less curious like I say it's not like strong

236
0:17:14.280 --> 0:17:18.260
It's just like it's like we're dumping files on your computer in a different way that isn't illogical

237
0:17:18.760 --> 0:17:23.200
And so if you see anything weird that's for example if you see in in

238
0:17:23.920 --> 0:17:25.440
electronus is

239
0:17:25.440 --> 0:17:32.200
Screenshot there, it'll be like local colon forward slash and then like a bunch of crap that like random string is like a

240
0:17:32.760 --> 0:17:38.480
Lookup in the database. I was talking about and that database then knows exactly where that is

241
0:17:38.480 --> 0:17:41.760
It maps it to an actual fault of the future and a father for anyone in news

242
0:17:42.640 --> 0:17:46.920
Actually, I forgot. I built it yesterday because I was a bit. I don't know I was bored, and I did it

243
0:17:46.920 --> 0:17:51.040
It was pretty quick. I put a new meme in my memes for this to go to public purple prime

244
0:17:51.040 --> 0:17:53.760
And then go to memes there is a new meme peace weapon

245
0:17:53.760 --> 0:17:58.120
The typing I have lots of time I love it when I mention people that are typing and then they stop

246
0:17:58.120 --> 0:18:02.960
So we have a question here, which I will read and give my interpretation to but it is a moderation question

247
0:18:02.960 --> 0:18:05.720
So I will refer it to the Sunday moderation office hours

248
0:18:06.000 --> 0:18:12.440
So it's within us when it comes to figuring out guidelines and such could having a poll over different future rules guidelines be helpful

249
0:18:12.440 --> 0:18:14.440
tool no um

250
0:18:14.520 --> 0:18:20.100
Polls are great because they give you like a quantity of data, but they don't give you what's called qualitative data

251
0:18:20.100 --> 0:18:23.880
I always get this confused. I probably did it wrong. I did it wrong. Don't yell at me

252
0:18:23.880 --> 0:18:30.160
The point being is like I can see cool 50 people think that this is cool and 50 people think that this is not cool

253
0:18:30.160 --> 0:18:34.540
Great. What does that give me? I don't understand we need more like opinions and stuff like that

254
0:18:34.540 --> 0:18:40.400
Do you remember that the anonymous feedback forum is there also remember the regardless of what you say? This is gonna sound rude

255
0:18:40.400 --> 0:18:44.960
I apologize regardless of what you say as an opinion regardless of the poll result

256
0:18:44.960 --> 0:18:52.280
Moderation have to make the best possible choice factoring everything a good example here being in the clothing area. We are

257
0:18:52.800 --> 0:18:57.280
Fortunate enough to be our own platform and so we can decide what we would like to do there

258
0:18:57.800 --> 0:19:00.080
If you think back to the days of mixer

259
0:19:00.960 --> 0:19:02.760
Which I used to work for

260
0:19:02.760 --> 0:19:04.960
Mixer was under the umbrella of Microsoft

261
0:19:04.960 --> 0:19:12.500
And so even though mixer itself had a view on clothing we had to conform to the big corporate agenda on clothing

262
0:19:12.500 --> 0:19:17.780
Which meant it twice as complicated but also meant we couldn't like people like it should be like this and we're like, yeah

263
0:19:17.780 --> 0:19:20.860
We know but like we can't but we couldn't even say yeah

264
0:19:20.860 --> 0:19:26.620
We know because that adds doubt to like your customers like brain space of that brand. So we're just like no, sorry

265
0:19:26.620 --> 0:19:30.940
This is this this is it. We don't want to do that. And I know that moderation don't want to do that

266
0:19:30.940 --> 0:19:37.180
That's why the conversations are open and feedback is being held but polls are just like not the way should be doing it

267
0:19:37.180 --> 0:19:41.580
I know that's the way it's done in like a democracy, right? But like no no

268
0:19:41.580 --> 0:19:44.460
Yeah, nice isn't a democracy. We try and be as

269
0:19:45.060 --> 0:19:47.060
Good the community as possible

270
0:19:47.340 --> 0:19:53.780
But in some cases, you know can't now I know that nears his stance has always been that we wouldn't take outside venture capital

271
0:19:53.780 --> 0:19:59.380
But I'm providing this as an example if nears if don't quote me on Twitter later

272
0:19:59.380 --> 0:20:02.740
I'm saying the word if a few times if nears took

273
0:20:03.260 --> 0:20:08.700
Venture capital of a substantial amount from another company. They may be able to say hey

274
0:20:08.700 --> 0:20:15.260
We need you to change your clothing policy again, and it needs to conform to you know business needs

275
0:20:15.660 --> 0:20:18.860
business business business business and so

276
0:20:19.380 --> 0:20:25.820
Just like think about that the next time you are the next time you're mad at a company for changing their policies

277
0:20:25.900 --> 0:20:28.460
Just just think about all the things in play there

278
0:20:29.140 --> 0:20:34.980
Another good example here being what happened to OnlyFans. So OnlyFans had like advertisers

279
0:20:34.980 --> 0:20:40.140
Sponsorship venture capital etc. That was just not okay with them having

280
0:20:40.660 --> 0:20:45.820
pornography on OnlyFans and so they tried to remove pornography from OnlyFans and of course the community were like

281
0:20:45.980 --> 0:20:53.100
Screw that and then OnlyFans had to then probably change up a bunch of their ad deals such that there could be same thing happens

282
0:20:53.100 --> 0:20:53.940
with

283
0:20:53.940 --> 0:20:56.340
YouTube people like why is my YouTube video being

284
0:20:56.540 --> 0:21:03.740
Demonetized YouTube hates this the reason is because monetization through YouTube comes through adverts and if no one wants to put adverts on a particular

285
0:21:03.740 --> 0:21:09.700
Type of content let's say you know none of the advertisers that are registered with the other side of monetization as in they are paying

286
0:21:09.780 --> 0:21:11.260
YouTube to put ads on videos

287
0:21:11.260 --> 0:21:16.500
They don't want to appear in any cheese related videos then the fact that you mentioned cheese in your video would cause it to be

288
0:21:16.580 --> 0:21:18.460
Demonetized isn't YouTube's fault

289
0:21:18.460 --> 0:21:24.780
It's the advertisers that they're working if they could find a cheese advertiser that wants to be monetized on cheese videos

290
0:21:25.420 --> 0:21:27.660
Beautiful and they probably have cheese adverts somewhere

291
0:21:28.340 --> 0:21:31.980
But when it comes to sort of real edgy topics some advertising people

292
0:21:31.980 --> 0:21:36.540
Just don't want adverts on there and so that video gets demonetized. It's nothing to do with YouTube though

293
0:21:36.580 --> 0:21:38.780
There are no ad money. We cannot pay you

294
0:21:40.420 --> 0:21:46.260
Moving onwards to another question we have here from SLS doesn't Rothenberg Ventures own 10 to 15 percent of strikes

295
0:21:47.220 --> 0:21:49.220
Rothenberg Ventures doesn't exist any so

296
0:21:50.020 --> 0:21:51.700
Rampa if you're typing question go for it

297
0:21:51.700 --> 0:21:57.020
Otherwise we'll cut off at the point as we just run over by two minutes with me ranting about demonetization on YouTube

298
0:21:57.580 --> 0:22:00.740
Like I've been on the other side of it like I've been on the other side of advertisers

299
0:22:00.740 --> 0:22:03.660
I've been on the other side of monetization. I've been in the side of that so it makes a lot more

300
0:22:03.660 --> 0:22:08.540
Okay, that was a question so go ahead and end up here, and then we will carry on on anyway

301
0:22:08.540 --> 0:22:12.180
And as I said check that new meme and my memes for if any of the questions

302
0:22:12.180 --> 0:22:17.260
Please feel to demand me or follow the contacting the Neos team guidelines. I'll get this posted soon and

303
0:22:17.260 --> 0:22:33.300
Tag the office hours notification do that when it's ready speech you next time. Bye
