1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
 Alright, so welcome to office hours. It's been a little bit of a gap before the last one we had

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,620
 That's because I was away for the holiday period but I'm back and we're back to regular scheduled broadcasting with the office hours

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,340
 Tuesday at 4 p.m. My time zone which is a Pacific. You can check the office hours wiki page for it in other time zones

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,340
 So this is the AMA

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,940
 Office hours where you can ask questions about Nius and we go through them in the order that is shown in the thread

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,840
 Which I just created. I see some questions in there. So we'll get started on those questions

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,320
 So we have a question here from a rigorous who says how does Nios handle my composition?

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,480
 Actually, I can't answer. I think I know what's going on, but I don't want to be unauthoritative

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,920
 the netcode

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,580
 Code being the sort of stuff that glues together the synchronization and the way that Nia speaks to other people in the session

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,880
 Isn't something I've taken a good look at I'm aware of sort of parts of how it works

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,100
 I'm not aware of

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,820
 How all of that works if you expand your question with additional sort of like elaboration or areas you're looking at

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,680
 I'm about to help further. Otherwise, I'm sorry. I can't answer that one move forward to unnamed cyborg cat who asked

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,180
 What's Nios achieved in 2022?

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,960
 You can check the newest updates channel or the answers channel for stuff that we have done in 22 that is published again

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,480
 If you expand or elaborate a question into additional areas or avenues, it might be easier to answer

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,080
 But that's a really broad question moving forwards to

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,140
 This is second question, which says is there any updates for Nios planned for this year or next year?

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,960
 And there are always updates planned. We just can't do them currently see announcements, etc, etc

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,640
 And with that unfortunately, we're out of questions. So keep them coming. Otherwise, we'll be set here and unimaginable unending

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,560
 tormenting silence

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,200
 Waiting for questions. I do think I could probably take the gap in questions

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,040
 There's an opportunity to wish you the very best for the new year. I had many difficulties typing the word 2023 today

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,880
 I had to put it into the thread. I had to put it into the

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,500
 Various other things as well. So we have another question here from Jack who says how was New Year's?

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,660
 I spent it at Geens's house Geens throws a sort of almost annual tradition now, which is a party his house for New Year's

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,940
 It was great. Saw a lot of Nios people there

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,820
 Met some new faces saw some old faces

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,380
 Lots of fun was had

31
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,260
 Chikal girl says how is your own personal work on medical insulation thing? It's it's going well

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,740
 There's not really much to say

33
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,260
 On top of the videos I produce sort of in November December last year

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,840
 That's sort of where we're at right now are doing some additional exploration into sort of what's going on there

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,360
 But to share right now

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,700
 Okay

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,500
 So check a girl says if you're very old you might refer to January's check your area the month we accidentally write the previous year

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 on your checks

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,100
 Checks I am aware that like some

40
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
 businesses and

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:45,280
 Landlords and my rental places still don't understand direct deposit but like you don't need checks anymore. You just use what's called direct deposit

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,220
 So your money can go straight in your bank and the rent can come straight back out again

43
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,280
 I've heard many a story about landlords who don't understand direct deposit and they want their like rent in cash

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,080
 No, just like are they filing taxes on your rental? Is it a legal rental?

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,020
 Paying cash. It's a bit weird

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,580
 You should at least get paperwork if you're paying a rent in cash

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,040
 Make sure you get paperwork invoice for rent the fact that it's been received and signed and stuff like that like crazy

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,200
 Sometimes they want checks that's like okay ish

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
 But you should encourage them to use direct deposit

50
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,060
 The way does I have is like if they don't need cash or if they won't accept cash or sorry

51
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,120
 They won't accept direct deposit which means cash or check then they have to come visit you and you have to talk to them

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,900
 I don't want to talk to my landlord

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,220
 It's not a desire I have if I talk to them it means something is wrong

54
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,380
 So direct deposit the rent just goes straight to them

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,260
 I don't know when it just does when I see it, you know

56
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,020
 It's not something I do manually moving forwards to a reverse this question

57
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,700
 Who says it's possible make a web server in logics in Neos with logics? No

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,500
 logics is a language ish the

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,340
 interacts with the Neos world and the Neos

60
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,860
 data model and the Neos engine

61
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,100
 So it's limited in what it can do

62
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,100
 There are some things it can do the sort of exceed the bounds of Neos for example the HTTP or web socket nodes

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:12,040
 But remember that it is running within a another engine. So you can't do it to you. You can't use it to solve generic tasks

64
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,180
 It's sort of the equivalent of saying can you make a web server in redstone in Minecraft?

65
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,460
 Like I hope that helps you sort of picture in your head moving forward to another question abysmal says is there currently a maximum?

66
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,980
 Maximum of users that can join a session

67
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,080
 Do you know how many avatars Neos is aiming to support once can expect Neos to be usable for MMO player counts?

68
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,580
 Um, there isn't a maximum which is enforced by anything that is decision-based

69
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,460
 so the only maximum would be like technical and so it's probably something close to one of the

70
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,620
 binary numbers

71
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,500
 But I wouldn't know which one it was without looking a nose in high as 50

72
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,240
 I'm pretty sure I can go higher than that. Like there's no there's no real like limit that we have made a decision about

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,000
 As for what we're aiming for we are aiming to make that better to get that number up

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,740
 Particularly to get that number up to sort of you know, be more of sort of VR chat style levels

75
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,100
 I don't know if we're aiming or able to get it to the MMO player count would need much more culling there pretty

76
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,980
 Automatic culling I know that the community are great and putting all the culling systems into their world

77
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,120
 But you shouldn't have to we should have a native solution

78
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,100
 So once we have that it should make every world able to be called as well as the the cold sessions that you see from

79
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,420
 The systems that people are making and installing in them and then a reverse also asks is it possible to make auto load?

80
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,860
 Sort of the problem level of detail is it depends on what you mean? So in games

81
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,760
 Level of detail is you just sort of like stuff will look less detailed the further away you are from you can sometimes see that

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,520
 Pop in which is where they've done lots slightly incorrectly

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,100
 where you know

84
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,780
 You'll sort of like go over the threshold of a doorway or something and the contents of the room inside will turn from sort of shit

85
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,660
 Tier to like amazing tier graphics. That's an example of log being done incorrectly to do it in a way where it's not noticeable

86
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,420
 You can absolutely do some mod systems there, but the limitation is

87
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,180
 that the LODs are

88
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:08,140
 Always loaded in so for example if you're a high poly one or a low poly one, that's still loaded into the world

89
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,020
 You're just swapping between them for rendering. So while you do maybe get a little hit for rendering which is better

90
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,440
 You'll lose that on the sort of model being in memory in the games thing

91
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,160
 They you know, they try and load only the details that you need

92
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,380
 So if you never visit an area, they don't load the high poly version of that area for example

93
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,560
 There is a gap issue for more LOD related stuff. Yeah, the inbuilt LOD one is like a little you have a lot component

94
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,540
 I just it's weird. So we have another question here from Marubus who says

95
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,760
 How do I measure distance from a player to an object in logics?

96
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,180
 so the easiest way to do that would be to

97
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,040
 Grab a slot reference to both the player and a slot reference to the object

98
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,120
 Make sure they're both in global by using the global transform node

99
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,840
 That's just easier and then plug both of their positions the global position of the player and the level position of the object

100
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,080
 Into the distance node which exists in an operators or math at large that will calculate you the distance

101
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
 We're gonna do it automatically. There are various things

102
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,600
 Use a distance value driver

103
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,680
 And stuff like that. They'll handle the whole like global cool mess for you, but that's how you do it

104
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,860
 It's just a mathematical thing the distance between two objects is just the difference in their position and then you

105
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,200
 normalize everything and the distance node also

106
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,420
 Magnitude because it's a three-dimensional thingy. Jbot says question similar to the surgical visual planning

107
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,720
 Where are there other projects for Neos focused on building digital workspaces be it for dialing manufacturing?

108
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,280
 Not that I'm aware of but probably I mean there's like God knows what going on. Not that I'm aware of

109
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,880
 Moving on to Rigibus who says can Neos interface with a drawing tablet?

110
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,440
 Depends on what you mean

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,300
 You can put the Neos screen on a drawing tablet and then the pen will work with it

112
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,720
 As in when you push if it's like, you know, if operates as a mouse like where you put the pen will push

113
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,680
 We do not interface with the drawing tablet sort of pressure sensors

114
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,360
 Smoothness angle sensors or anything like that. It would literally just be a click touch screen like one of those really bad touch screens

115
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,400
 You know like an airport touch screen. Yeah, one of those I was on a lot of planes over the holidays and

116
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,640
 In-flight entertainment systems god damn their touch screens are bad. Specs are answering their question though. I think

117
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:21,200
 Wraith, what ID do you use these days? I am on a mixture of Visual Studio code for anything that is not like

118
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:29,800
 Compiling if it needs compiling I should try to go to Visual Studio hate to be boring, but I need stuff to just work and

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,740
 Once it works, I don't really have like much inkling to change it

120
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,980
 So getting Neos compiling in Visual Studio was like a two-week effort and now it works. I'm like cool

121
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,260
 Let's not break. Rigibus says how smooth does

122
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,780
 Neos run on the Raspberry Pi 3? I don't know. I don't own a Raspberry Pi 3

123
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,960
 I own a Raspberry Pi 4, a Raspberry Pi 0 and a Raspberry Pi 2 so I don't know. I skipped the 3

124
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,500
 You're more than welcome to try that is what's called an empirical question

125
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,100
 Rampa says that it's not boring with the community vs license being pretty good. It does it is good

126
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:08,200
 What I meant by that is like some people expect on a cool tools or better workflows, etc

127
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,540
 I'm like so ask would you know what causes the loading indicator for a world to stay open and never finish?

128
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,920
 I don't know. There's a bug open for it though. Alright, so we have

129
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
 another question here from Rigibus who says

130
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,760
 How does Neos multiplayer architecture work? Is the Neos backend just a big database with reference to IP addresses that contain the public instances?

131
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,340
 Again, your question is it's more focused. Got that. It's more focused, but it's still unfocused

132
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,180
 So there are two parts of the multiplayer architecture

133
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,720
 So there's the stuff where we communicate to the cloud and then there's the stuff where we communicate to the session host

134
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,440
 And those two different things they do overlap in some cases, but those are two different

135
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,900
 So again, it depends what you mean based on the second part of your question, though

136
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,480
 I'll assume we're talking about session listing in that case

137
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,760
 Session listing is just a big database with a reference of where to connect there might not be an IP address

138
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,160
 It might be like some other route or some other thing

139
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,840
 Sometimes it's a bit more complicated than that. But yeah, that's the session list. It's big database keep the questions coming

140
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,380
 Yeah, the river says how do I switch between sessions and desktop?

141
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,840
 I know the session list facet thing that requires it in the dashboard has been put up

142
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
 You can't all tab as far as I'm aware

143
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,060
 Jack said you could troll tab shift look at that on the

144
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,700
 Troll tab and okay guys make sure to read the basic controls wiki page

145
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,240
 Which has a lot of sort of shortcuts which aren't documented anywhere and tell you how to use this

146
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,360
 That's our bad. We'll fix that as soon as we can

147
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,280
 Additionally to that the original way that you are meant to transit between sessions

148
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,820
 without the facet which I made and without the legacy world switcher is if you go to the

149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,000
 Active sessions tab of the world browser you'll see the sessions that you're in there at the top and you can select them there and

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
 Then click focus world on the pop-up that appears

151
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,080
 So those are a variety of ways to do it. I thought that that was

152
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:02,180
 Potentially confusing and not like a short path. That's why I made that facet. There's lots of praise for the world's are invested

153
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,240
 That's the one I made I like I just got annoyed and I solved a problem and everyone else was like I'm annoyed by that

154
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,080
 Too and they just like everyone installed it. It was great. Yeah, we are investigating making it into some default facet

155
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:20,640
 Puddle Nexus world so Lex is talking about a world I made where there's an active sessions ball for each world

156
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,700
 Yeah, I just I hacked the world browser apart to make that work

157
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:31,840
 So that world is technically a world browser where I've convinced it not to make UIX stuff

158
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,360
 I never intended it for it to work or people to enjoy going there

159
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,480
 It's just sort of like this is asking what portals are and how they work since some people mess with them

160
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,800
 I can understand what they did. How do you mean?

161
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:49,740
 Camera portals or well, let's make a second screen arampa. That's why I did camera portals. Okay, so camera portals are

162
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,980
 Somewhat similar to and it's kind of like good to view them like this

163
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,240
 Having another headset in the world that you can sort of look through

164
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,080
 So what it does is it makes a camera like a traditional camera, but it renders it stereoscopically

165
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
 so

166
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,600
 The you know, the left eye is different from the right eye and it does that according to your headset your your rendering, etc

167
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,160
 But only when you're looking at that camera portals like rendering pain

168
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,080
 So it's like having like another headset camera, you know with the two left eye right anything in the world

169
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,040
 That's really all it is. It's just like a rendering trick

170
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,060
 We get sort of a stereoscopic camera another word for it literally would be stereoscopic camera

171
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,000
 the bit that makes it cool and more portal like though is the ability to move the

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,400
 Camera location separately from the rendering location, which of course you can technically do have a camera as well

173
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
 It's just really confusingly named

174
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,760
 But it is like a portal to another part of the world or another

175
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,240
 Area, there's really not much to them though. You just like create a new object portal there

176
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,640
 You're done. You can make them different shapes different sizes. They don't need to be square

177
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,640
 You put them on like rings and stuff. That's always cool. That's how the portal guns usually work. The camera says

178
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
 What kind of optimizations can I do for big worlds?

179
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,120
 For big worlds, you need to make sure that you are culling so grab one of the culling systems already exists or make your own

180
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,160
 Not only culling objects, but also culling players. Make sure that's happening

181
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,620
 You need to balance your sounds so that you don't have more than 32 sounds running or like some of them will like not work

182
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,320
 You can make sure your assets are optimized effectively. For example, I once had to help a

183
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,860
 Game design student who was trying to do a project at university and their unity project wouldn't compile

184
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,360
 And I found out that they had a million trees in their scene because they wanted a forest and so they put a million

185
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,480
 individual trees in their scene and

186
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,600
 No

187
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,720
 That's not how you should do it

188
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,000
 So do keep an eye on that. The way you do it is you should have up close some trees

189
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,000
 As you go further and further away, you should transition to lower and lower poly trees and at a certain point

190
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,980
 Just a picture of trees and that's what you do. Other than that. It's like the contents low

191
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:08,340
 You know, do you need 8k textures on this piece of concrete? Probably not. Everything on the dash can be resized. Everything

192
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,440
 So the world browser itself, so I'm jumping around a little bit. There's comments about the world browser going on

193
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,520
 The world browser is composed of essentially four facets

194
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,400
 There's the filter list on the left which has you like everything, active sessions, features, etc

195
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,160
 There's the the grid in the middle

196
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,800
 which is all the sessions and then there is the search bar at the top middle and the

197
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:34,720
 pagination bar on the top right. Those are all facets. You can move them around exactly like other facets. As for questions

198
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,560
 Specs says are there any plans to update the content hub in the future? I would love

199
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,980
 I kind of love the place and it would be a little sad if it got left in dust in a favour and made it more convenient dashboard UIs

200
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,480
 I do believe that the content team have plans to update it

201
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,740
 For anyone who's not aware of what the content hub is, that is the space station

202
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,560
 satellite space station thingy

203
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,320
 Which was used in a lot of streams

204
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,420
 until the twitch house got created and then we

205
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:06,040
 It's meant to be like a content hub. It's meant to be I guess a little bit like the VRChat home

206
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,760
 You know, there's like you can go discover what's out there. It just has been it was deprioritized for the MTC and you know

207
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,600
 Busy working on other stuff. So I hope it returns. Ray said that be kind of more of a question for the content team

208
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,400
 Yeah, if the content team had an office hours, maybe that would be cool

209
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,700
 I mean you can ask them questions at workshop Wednesday. That's usually where I catch them

210
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,440
 I can catch them whenever I want, but you know, if you're a user you want to ask the content team questions

211
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,800
 Try the workshop Wednesday stream. Yeah, I understand that workshop Wednesday is on hiatus

212
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
 That's usually where I can. Moving on to Rigibus' question when importing assets from blender

213
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,200
 Is there any don't @ team members at me? If you need to @ team member at me, I can take it

214
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,240
 I'm weird like that. I can like just process notifications quite well

215
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,320
 Is there any kind of thing I need to do in a blender project to make it work better?

216
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,960
 I've tried importing some models from blender, but the scale would always be wrong

217
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,540
 Scale is one which is actually kind of easy to do. So if I default blender scale is in meters

218
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,000
 So when you import a model from blender or any other source that you know has been in blender

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Usually what you say and what I say in my tutorials is I go 3d model and then auto size, right?

220
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,960
 I always say select auto size if you know, it came from blender and you know that blender was using meters for it

221
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,700
 It's like scene units like this the units of the file

222
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,560
 Select meters rather than auto scale and then it will come in at the exact scale

223
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,560
 Which it was in in blender. If you export to FBX or other things then you'll have oddities generally

224
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,900
 I'm trying to sort of advise going away from FBX these days head was GLTF if you need to do avatars and animations and stuff

225
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,660
 Blender works well as well. Blender it'll just turn into an FBX and a GL whatever

226
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,380
 Try it though. Um, I will be making a tutorial on at some point

227
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,860
 until then go into blender make a one meter by one meter cube in blender import it into

228
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,540
 Neos until you get a one meter by one meter cube in Neos you can use the meter tip for that

229
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,420
 And that will allow you to sort of see what size it is

230
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,780
 And then you'll know what works and the reason why I'm telling you to do it

231
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,600
 Even though I will make a tutorial at some point is it'll give you a feel for what's going on

232
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,300
 Like if you import a one meter by one meter cube and it comes in a hundred meters, you know

233
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,440
 Oh, I understand what's happening here Neos or blender or something in the middle here for some reason

234
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,460
 It's making everything a hundred times bigger like get a feel for your workflow spend time on your workflow as well

235
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,260
 I know sometimes the temptation is like well if I do three hours work on each model

236
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,900
 Then I don't have to work on the workflow or you can just work on the workflow and then you don't need to spend that

237
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,340
 time every time

238
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,120
 It was it for the blender question. If you have any other blender issues you add more questions

239
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,780
 Arukabha says it's possible to make a mod to lower the resolution of all active mirrors in Neos

240
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,860
 It is please ask the modding community for that on the mod you've scored. Just a quick reminder here

241
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,580
 Because people are talking about map makers not adding, you know, things like mirror options stuff like that

242
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,240
 You go to Neos Essentials Mirrors

243
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,120
 There is a wide array of mirrors the ones to the right usually have those menus and the ones to the left don't

244
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,380
 So you pick one on the right and then you can have automatic

245
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,900
 mirror resolution modifiers

246
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,520
 Additionally, remember that we have the community sort of standards thing that is able to happen

247
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,560
 We were able to do it with the colors for music that was done. Most people use the same

248
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:17,160
 Variables for that these days your avatar just works someone could write up a standard for

249
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,120
 cloud variables and stuff for

250
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,520
 resolution right and then it could be hey, I am telling you the

251
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,880
 cloud variable

252
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,840
 resolution

253
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,160
 Scale on off state of mirrors in the world and then you can say you could do that

254
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,580
 Perfectly, you probably need to do that via group and go to like I don't know G standards or something

255
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:44,660
 I don't know whatever but like you could do it is within your power to do it. Should we Neos maybe have some standard

256
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,160
 Cloud variables that you can hook into probably but we don't currently

257
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:55,200
 Where are we? Fuzzy ask is there a page about the non standard standard stuff? Yeah, I mean

258
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,880
 It's a complete mess but like

259
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,800
 I've been meaning to tidy up if I tidy up it starts looking like official and I don't want to be official because it's not

260
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,160
 official

261
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,560
 There's some stuff there that has just got it's mostly audio and like audio color stuff. So alright got some more questions

262
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,720
 Does these supports playing SVG files?

263
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,400
 Don't remember gonna say no

264
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,480
 Make an issue on the gap if you'd like to see that

265
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,640
 This also asks how variables work in logics again that really does depend on the avenue that you're after so, please

266
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,640
 Try a lab ring on the questions. See if you can make it any sort of more

267
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,120
 Detailed and be able to answer that one. Otherwise, it's a bit sort of too vague

268
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,940
 You know that could be how do variables synchronize which is a 20 minute explanation or how do you write a variable?

269
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,380
 Which is like a 30 second explanation like it you expand your question

270
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,000
 I can I can help you out better how to read and write the variables. Ah, yeah. Okay. There we go

271
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,960
 Um, so there's there's various ways to do that and it depends on the type of variable that you're using the thing

272
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,320
 that you need to remember is

273
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,640
 The most fields like every time for example, every time we see a number that's probably an int or a float field

274
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,460
 Sometimes it's a double and some other weird ones. Don't worry about it

275
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,840
 But it's usually a float or an integer and that is a variable and you can write to it if it's part of a component

276
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 You'll need to use the logic interface card

277
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,760
 If it's in logics, then you can use the nodes for that those are in variable storage value register

278
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,720
 And then into a float whatever type you want there and then you can use the right note to write to those

279
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,080
 But you can also use the right note to write to logic interface cards

280
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,920
 They're all variables and you can all write to them

281
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,340
 If that didn't make sense, then I would suggest taking a look at the introduction to logics. There's a very good video by a business

282
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,340
 Basement nerd. Sorry. There is also one by

283
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,560
 Business law is a little bit older now so you try both of those triple yeah like pretty much every single time you see a text

284
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,480
 Box of some kind where you can type in a number or a letter or a type or anything like that

285
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,020
 It's a variable in those various ways to do. Jackal asks if you import vector files. Does anyone understand what it is?

286
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,860
 No, we don't. With that we are at half past so I'm gonna go ahead and say

287
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,280
 777Faku if you have a question, please continue typing it. Rigibus if you have a question continue typing it

288
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,960
 But the only two additional questions I take for this office

289
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:15,260
 I'll just make noises. Rigibus says how does the newest database I had the database corrupted yesterday and I was wondering how Neos

290
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,320
 Stores something like a SQLite database. It is a SQLite database. I believe it's NoSQLite

291
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,520
 I don't remember. The point being is that there is a local database lightdb. That's the one. It's a NoSQL

292
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,080
 SQLite style thingy

293
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,620
 It's basically a file and the file is a database that can be queried by Neos and it

294
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,960
 And what we do is we say hey database, where is

295
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,720
 Rafe's face text?

296
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,840
 Where is the texture for Rafe's face and the database goes it is here and that here that I'm talking about is usually a file path

297
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,280
 On your computer and then it picks up from the computer and goes here you go

298
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,520
 I'm now rendering Rafe's face and we don't need to redownload it from the internet because we had it stored locally in the cache

299
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,980
 When the database corrupts it means that file that light database has corrupted and we can't read from it

300
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,800
 And therefore we don't know what's going on. You know, we can't figure out where those files are

301
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,320
 And that's what happens when it gets corrupt

302
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:16,340
 That's why we need to repair when we repair it we switch from sort of interrogating as a database. We switch to interrogating it as

303
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:23,260
 A file that has a problem we fix that problem if we can and then we go back to interrogating as a database

304
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,800
 It is time. I will allow a reverse expanded question because it is related to the previous one

305
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,080
 And I said I would allow some of the vacuus stuff. So I'll read that even though I haven't I don't know

306
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,940
 I don't think it's a question. I don't see a question mark at least I'll read in just a second

307
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,480
 Um, so they say how does neo store the local cache? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. I understand. Thank you

308
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,520
 How does neo store the local cache? The local cache is stored as a bunch of you can go just look at them

309
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,940
 There are much of files. They are sort of encrypted, but it's not like encrypting encryption that would be used for anything security related

310
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:01,640
 It's it's more sort of partially organizational partially encryption. The light database itself is also encrypted

311
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,480
 But again, it's not military-grade encryption

312
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,040
 Just a sideline by the way, if you see a VPN advert that's talking about military-grade encryption

313
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:15,760
 Yeah, your browser already uses it don't buy a VPN if you just want military-grade encryption. Your browser already does it. Anyway

314
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,320
 Point being there is a little bit of encryption involved, but it's not strong. It's not designed to be strong. As for how it stores

315
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,080
 It's just files on your computer and then 775 who said they had an idea in the back of mind for AI

316
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,400
 Integrations for example having a fairy guy that can listen in on command and help out with things like logics and other radio functions

317
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,780
 Do it I would love it

318
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,540
 Lots of people talking about getting documentation into games

319
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,500
 And into news being quite interest and stuff like that is one way that it could be done

320
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,180
 We're not quite sure how we're going to do it. But when we do do that, we'll see what's going on

321
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:54,860
 I'd love it if there was a way to click on a logics node and it popped up the information about it, videos, pictures, guides, etc

322
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,300
 You could even directly like spawn examples of how to use it in the world all sorts of cool stuff like that

323
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,820
 I'll come up with some. With that I believe we're at the end of office hours. I'll go ahead and leave off here and

324
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,140
 I will speak to you later. Bye bye
