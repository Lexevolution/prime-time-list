00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay everyone, welcome to prime time. Please drop questions if you have them in the questions for prime time text thread, which is a few channels by this one, and we'll get started with them on the order that they appear.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let me go ahead and get started. We have just two questions currently, so one question and two questions from Ozi. Fantastic. We'll go straight for those. So Ozi asks, what's the most elusive bug you have yet to catch? Understanding this.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's still going to be like a bunch of the what I call like date time jank bugs that exist and are assigned to me. I'm quite an expert in date time stuff, just generically, and so I thought I could take a look at them.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They keep going mad. There's something called round tripping, which is where you want to take a date, do something with it, and get like the same quality of date back.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So an example here in terms of like what I mean by doing something is like parsing or formatting or displaying. In Neos, the most problematic one being saving and loading. So when you create a date inside of Neos, which is, you know, using C sharp under the hood,

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the time zone that that date is created in doesn't really get saved and stuff. It's a long story. And so when you load it, sometimes weird stuff happens because, like, if you load it one way, then C sharp or in some cases Neos or in some cases just like unity or anything in between.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's basically like, oh, this date is UTC. I will touch it and make it local time. And if it keeps doing that because it's not being saved correctly, then you get a date which just sort of slides forwards into infinity.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think that's what's happening with one bug in particular, which is that a date time node of particular futureness crashes some users but not other users.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I believe it's still currently any user which is past the international date line, sorry, the meridian line that's past the GMT meridian line will crash, which is a very interesting bug.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's basically if you're east of London, you crash. That's it. It's, like, crazy. If you're America or, you know, anything to the west, you're totally fine.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm not quite sure it wraps back around the other side, but that's what was happening when I had a chance to look into it. That's just data in is not data out in some cases.

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm trying to sort of make that have tests for it. I haven't looked at that in quite a while, many months at this point.

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Moving forwards, OZ says, any luck with the world partners? No. I did ask for some stuff. They are traveling right now, though, so they've been less responsive than usual.

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But they said if it matches the paths used for some other mechanics we do, then it should be fine, and I checked and it does. So I don't know.

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Also, people who have the ability to decompile, taking a look around for me and they couldn't find anything that made sense. It's interesting because a lot of people are, like, looking into the world loading code, but it's not in there.

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's in the record loading code. Anything which is saved in Neos, just like at all is a record, and a record can be an object or a world.

17
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And so when you load a world, you're actually loading a record and a record's content. It's just a sort of world is an abstraction on top of record.

18
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So when I attempt to expand storage, it doesn't work. You are quite right in receiving advice. But you are going to be today my prime candidate for how to ask better questions.

19
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is probably a video I'll be creating at some point on my channel. But the phrase it doesn't work is the most annoying phrase I've heard in, like, all of existence.

20
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So every time I hear it, I have to be, like, it's okay. You don't need it. But it is the most annoying phrase.

21
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I'm going to, you know, we're going to role play a little bit. We're going to just say that your family member of significant age has rung you on the telephone.

22
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And on the other end of the telephone, they're, like, hi, my computer doesn't work. It doesn't work.

23
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And you ask, could you describe the problem? And they don't. They just say it doesn't work.

24
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And what you actually find out is that they haven't plugged it in.

25
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The asking good questions is, like, stop for a moment and make sure that you've set your question up so that it could be answered, if possible, without any additional questions being asked back to you.

26
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So that relative of significant age could be, like, yeah, I've tried, you know, I've double checked it. It's on. There's no power cut. We're not on an electrical storm.

27
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's no EMPs that have gone off during World War III. We're just, you know, we're fine.

28
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then you're, like, okay, cool. So I know it's not power. I know it's Internet. Great. Okay. You know.

29
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, and they told me what's on the screen. Great. So I know that they can see the Windows logo. You know, like, stuff like that, right?

30
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So what can you add to your question such that we're able to answer immediately?

31
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, for example, in how do I extend my storage, it doesn't work. You could say you get an error. Because if you say you get an error, then that's fantastic. That's the 2FA error, most likely.

32
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The red piece of text, it just says, like, error or it just says, I think it's referred to as TOTP. It just says TOTP in red text. That's 2FA. You need to enable 2FA.

33
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But if it happened to say purchase failed because your username starts with A, then I'm, like, oh, cool, that's a weird error.

34
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can then, like, go into the source code and I can take a look and I can be, like, oh, it seems that we don't allow people that have usernames that start with A to buy storage.

35
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like, because I don't know what message or what state or what part of the process that you occur in that you can't get expanding storage, I'm forced to guess.

36
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And when I'm forced to guess, sometimes I'll give incorrect answers. Now, while Coffee Kite said something which is absolutely correct and probably what's wrong, it also might be incorrect.

37
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Like, by them just saying 2FA, they're trying to be genuinely helpful. But what if you already have 2FA created?

38
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You might assume, oh, you cannot create or buy storage if you have 2FA enabled, so I will disable 2FA.

39
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Or maybe they're like, oh, I don't know what 2FA is, I'll go Google it. And when they go Google 2FA, because they don't understand what 2FA is, they come across a crypto scam and give their secret wallet phrase to some Elon Musk impersonator on the Internet.

40
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's just like a sort of compounded expansion problem that can be solved by just a better question.

41
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There's this film I reference sometimes. It's in some old office hours. It's called The Giver. It's about a dystopian society. It's based on a book. The book's apparently much better.

42
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I haven't had time to read a book in many years, but I'm sure the book's probably better. That's usually the case.

43
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And they have a society where they've kind of sort of removed most emotions, not in the same way as the film.

44
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's really quite equilibrium, but in a similar way. And so there aren't families anymore. There's family units. And extreme words just aren't really allowed.

45
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So things like love aren't used because it's something intangible. So when people use words like that in that society, they don't stop a medication that's making them robotic.

46
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So this is why it's happening. They'll just turn around and deadpan look at them and go, precision of language?

47
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And what they mean by that is use better phrasing. And I've taken to saying that when people use improper precision of language in statements.

48
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But it doesn't make any sense unless you've watched the film and know that I am suggesting that we go to a dystopian society where there exists.

49
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I'm just tired of a lack of precision of language in this particular conversation. It's a good film, anyway.

50
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I will leave you alone at progressions. I didn't mean to single you out there. It's just something I continue to say.

51
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I'm just like, I have an opportunity and a forum and a cert box right now to answer it. And we don't have additional questions.

52
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So I get to a whole amount of silly stuff like that. Please do let us know if getting 2FA sorted out fixes your issue.

53
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If it does not, please provide additional information and I will get it there. Oh, yeah, there were actually questions. Yes.

54
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It certainly did. Fantastic. Absolutely, yes. Great. No worries. Enjoy your storage.

55
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So unnamed cyborg cat says, is there some kind of text programming language in Neos?

56
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There are a couple of attempts to do so. There's a project which looks at doing C sharp into logics. It's quite limited.

57
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There's a project which does React JavaScript into Neos, which I question the sanity of, but, hooray, jazz hands, it exists.

58
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There is a couple of in Neos stuff that can do basic things. I think it places very snug and connects them.

59
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There's also a world where you can enter mathematical equations and get shapes. They use the triangle mesh and they position each triangle's point manually.

60
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's always fun. There's even a plugin made by managed, I guess would be the appropriate word by his linker here.

61
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He's also in chat called Neos Plus, which has dynamic mesh creation, which sort of is texty, but not really because it uses logics.

62
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So sort of. There's nothing native, though.

63
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It looks like the best answer right now is to follow Lex's current process.

64
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm speaking to them trying to find a better platform or some sort of way to do that that doesn't drive me insane or them insane.

65
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I appreciate what they're doing. I just know it's a burden. That's why I started putting them on Sounder so I didn't have to type notes anymore.

66
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Because Sounder looked like it was going to be a good platform that is now completely dying in January.

67
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Shrug, I guess.

68
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you guys want to make a podcasting platform and have a way to make it incredibly cheap and easy, do what Lex is doing, then you can make some money, I guess.

69
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Charge a couple of bucks with some pro features, you've got a business.

70
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Just like make a file store, any file store, wherever the hell you want it.

71
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
AWS, whatever the hell you want it.

72
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Make a web page.

73
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Publish RSS feeds.

74
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Conscribe using Whisper AI.

75
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You'll make a couple bucks.

76
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We'll keep you updated.

77
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
For now, the Neos Wiki is the sort of location.

78
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Beagle says, how's the medical meeting presentation thing?

79
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That was good. For those who don't know what I'm talking about or Beagle and I are talking about, I'll get the link to a video of that presentation.

80
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's a three minute presentation I gave at an event about ear, nose and throat, which is generically all head surgery and surgical conditions and stuff.

81
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
About some tooling that we're making inside of Neos.

82
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That presentation was also given entirely inside of Neos, which some people are quite amazed at.

83
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The amount of people that came to that world whilst I was building the presentation was like, could you publish this world so I could use it for my presentations too?

84
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I'm like, yeah, sure.

85
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The actual system took about 20 minutes.

86
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just a tiny piece of logics and that's it.

87
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But yeah, we'll take a look at it.

88
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
There's also some animations in there that are made entirely in Neos using various things and various tools.

89
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I am planning to do a behind the scenes video where I call out all of the public folder madness that is going on in there.

90
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I use Gehepe's motion and capture tool.

91
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I use Orange and the team that worked on that, the statue generator.

92
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I use value gradient driver a ton, which is great because I don't usually use value gradient driver.

93
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I do think people still use that for far too many things.

94
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Just use logics.

95
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We wrote logics for you, right?

96
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But sometimes it's useful to do various things.

97
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's even an object grid aligner in there for the single purpose of stacking some cards on a calendar on the Z axis.

98
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I used object grid aligner because it's the fastest way I could to stack those.

99
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So I'll go through that.

100
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So Gehepe also uses avatars from a MIT licensed horrific collection of avatars called the RocketBox collection.

101
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They're really good avatars.

102
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And a while ago I recommended that they look into adding face blend shapes.

103
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And rather than just adding the bare minimum or even like the bare minimum plus some niceties like most avatars have such as the Ready Player Me avatars.

104
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The RocketBox team added every single AR kit blend shape without fail.

105
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Every single one.

106
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The blend shape list on all of those avatars is something like 60 plus blend shapes.

107
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There are duplicates that I don't understand.

108
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It supports AR kit.

109
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It supports HTC facial tracker.

110
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It supports, I don't know, stuff I don't even understand.

111
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
On the top of that there are also facial bones.

112
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So if you don't want to use the blend shapes, you can also use facial bones.

113
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:27,000
For those who aren't aware, actually, if you're making an avatar and you want to get all those blend shapes together, creating facial bones, positioning those facial bones in the places that you would like and then deriving shape keys from the facial bones position is a great way to make those blend shapes.

114
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Because you can actually think about the movement of the face a lot better with facial bones.

115
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Most like films, 3D films, 3D games, et cetera, use facial bones rather than facial blend shapes.

116
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's why I usually get the 5,000% animationy things because they basically find the modifier for that and they crank it up.

117
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Things like Beyond Two Souls 500% is good.

118
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And that's got a theme to fill in.

119
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Take a look at the RocketBox.

120
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There's quite a few of the RocketBox avatars inside my public folder now.

121
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't know what to do with their blend shapes.

122
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Blend shapes aren't named in a way that is suitable for the HTC Face Tracker.

123
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You can set them up manually.

124
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Another thing that really drives me mad is people get so obsessed over the names of their blend shapes.

125
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm like, if you name your blend shape cow, potato, cheese, onion, sauce, and cabbage, it will still work with the HTC facial tracker.

126
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You just need to set it up manually.

127
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Which is absolutely fine.

128
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
By the time you've renamed half your blend shapes in Blender just for Neos, you could have set them up manually inside the game.

129
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Beagle says, do you win any awards on that presentation?

130
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Unfortunately, no, we did not.

131
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There were some really good projects, actually more than I had a preview at.

132
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There was a practice run through of the session a couple of days before.

133
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Not everyone attended that.

134
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So it was really cool.

135
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Alex says, on that same day, I thought you might have been in the local news since there's a topic on surgical training in VR.

136
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There's a lot of companies doing that.

137
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Unfortunately, a lot of companies in the area are doing the same thing.

138
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Or in some cases, they're doing what Neos has created to try and solve as well.

139
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
In that they have a code base that is designed to do one thing.

140
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So someone will come to them and say, let's do surgery planning for surgery on the head.

141
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
They will write an entire Unity code base to do that.

142
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And then the next week, someone will say, can we do surgery on the leg?

143
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And they go, oh, no, our current code base doesn't support legs, so we'll have to write an entirely new code base.

144
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Which, of course, makes them money and garners them potential profits, et cetera.

145
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But we turn around as Neo, so we're like, you can do whatever you want.

146
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Literally, whatever you want.

147
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Legs, heads, necks, bodies, whatever you want.

148
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Coffee has had a similar great experience presenting in VR.

149
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's great.

150
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:00,000
For those who aren't aware, new versions of OBS have a virtual webcam feature where you can basically take the output of OBS and turn it into a webcam.

151
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And so we capture Neos, take it as a webcam, and shove it into Zoom meetings.

152
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It works quite well.

153
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We haven't really managed to do the other way around, which is where we take the entire Zoom meeting and put it into a Neos world yet.

154
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And so that causes some issues when we're sort of talking about collaboration.

155
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There's also issues which I frequently tell other people to do this to look out for, which is that by default, the Neos streaming camera will do like an animation and a wobble in the third-person mode, too.

156
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's good.

157
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It gives some sort of natural camera angles to it.

158
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But when the entire rest of the Zoom meeting are static sort of above-the-chest shots of people wearing suits, it can be a little bit better.

159
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It can be a little bit motion sickness doing.

160
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It can also be a little bit sort of showboaty.

161
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So I try and sort of static the webcam as much as possible.

162
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
When I say webcam, I mean webcam in sort of quotes because it's OBS.

163
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And you'll see that in the presentation I give.

164
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I do do a flyover at the start of that video.

165
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That is just because I am obsessed in that presentation with convincing them that it is actually live, even though it's not because that's recording.

166
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But the point is it was live at the recording.

167
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Because a lot of times we get things like, that was fantastic, but that was prerecorded, right?

168
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And it's like, no.

169
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Luckily, after I gave the presentation at the actual event, there was time for questions.

170
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And during those questions, I was much more freeform with my movement and also what I was doing with my hands, et cetera.

171
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So hopefully they didn't think it was prerecorded because it wasn't prerecorded.

172
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Although portions of it were prerecorded because I was using the motion capture tool, which prerecords motion.

173
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But you know what I mean.

174
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
They think that we have played a video instead of rendered inside me.

175
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Rapper says the value gradient driver is great for precise time animation.

176
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You are correct, but I've seen people use value gradient driver for absolutely everything when a couple of logic nodes would do.

177
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I've seen people go like, oh, I can't use logic.

178
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You absolutely, absolutely can and should use logics.

179
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you're avoiding using logics for any reason, other than you want to, then done.

180
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You can use it.

181
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Beagle asks how much more work do you think is left on the medical prep thing you've been working on before it's ready for active use?

182
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Five plus years.

183
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
When you're doing stuff that's meant to be used for actual humans, it gets kind of difficult, which is why I say five years.

184
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Technically it could probably be ready by the end of the year, but it doesn't work like that.

185
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We have to get it ready as much as we understand and then speak to professionals and then they'll come back and they'll say, but you forgot about the neutron flow.

186
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And then that takes like three months for us to fix the neutron flow, whatever the hell they say.

187
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Sometimes I don't even know.

188
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:05,000
For example, we had a problem a few months back because the leg was upside down and it's difficult to explain.

189
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Watch the video.

190
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Basically, if the leg is upside down, then it won't work because the blood flow has been interrupted in such a way and then the leg will die when they put it in someone's face.

191
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And so they came into our world and they flipped the leg upside down and everything broke because we didn't realize that the leg needed to be upside down.

192
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So we had to adjust stuff to allow for legs being upside down, at which point you start questioning your existence because you don't understand.

193
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's also difficult to sort of get that information into a sort of piecemeal thing.

194
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If you work in the software industry and you're like, tell me the requirements of your piece of software, you'll know this problem.

195
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Just double that if it's medical in nature because it's just like, what are the requirements?

196
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
No one knows.

197
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No one knows because like in some cases, they deal with this planning, they figure it all out.

198
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But sometimes when it comes to surgery and it comes to them explaining the requirements, it's like the equivalent of just they make it up.

199
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So at the end of the day, they cut out pieces of your leg and pieces of your jaw and have to just sort of like screw those things back together.

200
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So sometimes it's just like really confusing.

201
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's an interesting question, which I can't really answer, but I can sort of, which is how does logic initialization time compared to component time for an item appearing in the world?

202
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What I mean by that is when it comes to objects being spawned in the world or being duplicated from a template, I've noticed that pure components tend to be faster than if I built the same functionality in logic.

203
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Probably because of slot count, right? And I'm going to say this again because people still don't listen.

204
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The slot count is the last thing you should be looking at when you're optimizing.

205
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Your slot count will be low if you've optimized something.

206
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So if you have a slot counter in your world or you're bullying people because of their slot count, I want you to look at your bench shapes and make sure they're baked because I bet you they're not.

207
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And that's causing more of an impact than whoever's got the large slot count.

208
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Additionally, if you have a high slot count, maybe remove that feature. Do you need the low orbit ion cannon attached to your avatar that you use once in a blue moon?

209
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No. Congratulations. You've just deleted a thousand thoughts and a lower ion cannon.

210
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But that's probably what you're saying there because logic tends to be one slot per operation, whereas components tends to be multiple components on the same slot that do a lot of stuff.

211
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
When it comes to initialization of that stuff, there is a bit of an overhead, of course.

212
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That word beginning of I, the logic's chain, it has to sort of build a map about which node connects to what node and how to shoulder tap that.

213
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But again, that's quite optimized and shouldn't be worried about.

214
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Ultimately, it should be a matter of perspective and preference rather than a matter of one does it better than the other.

215
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So if you do notice particular issues, please do open issues.

216
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:18,000
This made me realize how much unavailability of pro inhibits adoption of Neos.

217
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't know. How long is a piece of string?

218
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So, for those people that have purchased Neos Pro, I don't even have a list of them.

219
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
For those people that have asked questions about purchasing Neos Pro, I don't have a list of them.

220
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:40,000
For those people who have ignored the fact that they should have Neos Pro and have done stuff which requires Neos Pro without Neos Pro, I don't have a list of them.

221
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,760
For those people who have ignored Neos Pro and done stuff that requires Neos Pro without

222
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,120
asking, I have no way to know, and I probably wouldn't go after them anyway, because I don't

223
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,680
know that they're doing it.

224
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,580
We've always had a sort of, um, it's okay, in air quotes, if it's sort of, like, research

225
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:05,440
educational or medical in nature, but it would be great if that sort of stuff was ratified

226
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,840
into a way that could be policed.

227
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,920
We also have the problem where moderation do not police the terms of use.

228
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,800
They police the user guidelines, which are completely different.

229
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,760
For those who don't understand those, it's the difference between interacting with a

230
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,440
company and interacting with a community.

231
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,840
The Neos user guidelines are protecting the community.

232
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,520
The Neos terms of use is protecting business entity.

233
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,360
So they are different.

234
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:38,080
They do sometimes overlap in certain ways, but it's just to protect both the moderation

235
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,320
team and the business entity that they don't deal with enforcing business entity related

236
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
stuff.

237
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,800
They could, but that would be a discussion with leadership to figure out what paperwork

238
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,640
and compensation that they would like to give to the moderation team such that they could

239
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:03,880
sufficiently and adequately legally protect and help a business entity rather than community.

240
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,200
It's a complicated problem.

241
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,400
I am very happy that the moderation team are focused on what they are doing right now,

242
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,120
which is the community.

243
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,720
There's a reason why many, many, many companies, if not have their own legal department, have

244
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,000
a lawyer on retainer.

245
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,800
Sorry, I sighed at this next question.

246
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,080
I have heard multiple times from multiple people that Animex animations aren't very

247
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,000
component to, say, doing a bit of logic to move something around.

248
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,400
I expect the opposite most of the time.

249
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,760
Do you know if there's any truth to this and maybe why?

250
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,340
Don't know for certain.

251
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,320
Those people who are saying things like that need to provide data or I'm going to start

252
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,840
sending them angry cat GIFs because I'm tired of it.

253
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,280
If you think something is unperformant, test it.

254
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:51,360
There's a brilliant tweet from Orange, it is in Japan, it's in Japanese, so of course

255
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,080
you have to translate it, but effectively what they did is they did what we advise as

256
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,080
well is they went to an empty world and they spawned 20 copies of their avatar and looked

257
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
at the FPS.

258
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,800
They then made performance optimizations to their avatar and spawned 20 copies of their

259
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
avatar.

260
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,900
They managed to get, I can't remember, I'm just going to pull a number out of my head,

261
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:13,840
they got a 5 FPS increase by doing various things on their 20 avatar army.

262
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,680
So if you would like to make those claims about Animex being bad or good, provide some

263
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
data.

264
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,800
I know that there was another member of the Japanese community who made a tool which put

265
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,800
profiling data into a way that could be easily visualized and they proved that access aligner

266
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:38,720
was bad and we're like, yep, we totally know that because it updates every frame.

267
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
But that was good, right?

268
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,580
It gave the data in the form of a pie chart, which is super easy to read, but I'm tired

269
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,480
of people looking at stuff and going, I think this is bad, therefore I'm going to tell the

270
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,480
community that it's bad and therefore people are going to, like, not use it.

271
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,600
As far as I'm concerned, Animex animations are there for you to use, as is logic.

272
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,300
So it depends entirely on your preference.

273
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:07,720
What I will say is that I don't think we've seen a lot of people using Animex animations

274
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,360
and I think that they should be using them.

275
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,520
For example, and that is also because we haven't provided the tools to do it.

276
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,920
For example, the motion capture tool currently, it's terrible.

277
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,600
Like in terms of optimization, it's terrible.

278
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,760
But it's fantastic because it's the only thing that allows us to do that.

279
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,960
And so it's fantastic and I love it and I keep using it, hence why it's used in the

280
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
talk above.

281
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,480
But it records the slot positions of the hands and head and in my case the position of the

282
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,120
avatar every frame into dynamic variables.

283
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,320
So if you look through that code of the motion capture tool, you'll find right hand position

284
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:51,920
777, if you record 777 frames, that's how many dynamic variables you'll have.

285
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,560
It's bad, but it's good, right?

286
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
I wish we had better tools.

287
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,560
The better way of doing that would be for us to natively take the information and bake

288
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,400
it into an Animex animation, which I guarantee would be more performant based on the number

289
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,400
of times I accidentally opened the inspector on the slot that contained those dynamic variables

290
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,280
and almost died, both in game and out of game.

291
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,000
The OZ here has some data, which is fantastic.

292
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,520
They should publish a paper in a peer reviewed scientific journal.

293
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,160
They say animations, animators with a decent amount of bones attached to it with a looping

294
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,520
animation can slowly cause increasing costs for some reason.

295
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,960
You see this by duplicating a rig that has an animator a few times and slowly see the

296
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,480
CPU frame time go up.

297
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,240
So that might be an optimization that we need to perform.

298
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah, I know, I understand specs.

299
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,520
So I think you should use Animex, though, if you need to.

300
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
And I think you should use Logix if you need to.

301
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,680
If anyone's telling you that you can't use something, they should go look at Anger Cat

302
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
gifts all day.

303
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,320
For anyone who doubts my knowledge about optimization, I haven't been inside and outside of the engine

304
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,040
on every single question I get asked about optimization.

305
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,720
So in some cases, I literally just don't know, right?

306
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,480
But what I want is the data, right?

307
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,720
If someone makes a claim, I want the data.

308
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,600
I'm like, hey, if you want to say that this is bad, please provide the data.

309
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,540
Because in worlds that I build in, where I don't care, and I use whatever tool I need

310
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,940
to get the job done.

311
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:22,340
So for example, inside the surgical planning world, there is horrible Logix, which has

312
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,360
like duplicated nodes and all sorts of stuff.

313
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,460
We use the world dynamic variable space all the time.

314
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,420
We run at a solid 90 FPS with about five or six people in there, and that's all we need.

315
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,280
Because there's going to be like the surgical team in there, and that's it.

316
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
And that's fine.

317
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
And I'm like, cool.

318
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,800
What optimization have I done in this world?

319
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
None.

320
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,400
I do occasionally do some on there, but that's mostly because I'm being sort of paranoid

321
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
about it.

322
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:53,180
But like I'm not continually paranoid about optimization, except in cases where I need

323
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,180
to be.

324
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,120
And the cases where you need to be are your avatar, the cases where you don't need to

325
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,240
be are effectively worlds that you make.

326
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,040
If it's a world that you make, take a look at the FPS, if it's good, it's good, right?

327
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,800
If someone comes into your world that doesn't have baked blend shapes and et cetera, and

328
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,040
they say it's a laggy world, ask them to revisit that world in a default Head and Hands avatar,

329
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,000
and they'll figure it out.

330
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,400
The goal with Neos is that you don't have to be paranoid about that.

331
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,400
The goal with any sort of API is that you should not have to be paranoid about that,

332
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,860
and that the API should provide tools, techniques, documentation that guide you into the best

333
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,600
way to do something.

334
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,800
So are there bad things that you can do?

335
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Yes.

336
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,640
But there's also documentation in terms of videos and Wiki pages that guide you away

337
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
from doing that.

338
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,280
Biggest example being Fire on True, please put a user in the second input of Fire on

339
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,840
True or I will send you angry cat gifts.

340
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,800
Ramper asks another question, moving on from I get kind of grumpy when it comes to optimization.

341
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,240
I get it, guys, you're just trying to make your stuff better, but when I get people DMing

342
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,960
me and say, is there a performance improvement between a value field and a value register?

343
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,560
They were manually adding the value register node to slots rather than the value field

344
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:13,160
component slots, because they thought it was more performant, and I'm like, same thing.

345
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,120
Anyway, please continue asking performance questions, but understand that you'll probably

346
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,940
get the same response.

347
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,220
So Ramper's question.

348
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:27,000
One question that is not that much, there is a serious security, but anyway, I'll continue

349
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
reading.

350
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
Have you seen the discussion on rumors being spread about Neos?

351
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,080
Apparently someone was telling others that we are so insecure that people can key log

352
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,000
your PC by joining your session with a key log or a cooked avatar, what do you think

353
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
about this madness?

354
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,920
I think that that person should read our security policy before I send them angry cat gifts

355
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,780
and then report them to moderation if I see it.

356
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,480
There is a security policy for a reason.

357
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,920
If you make a security ticket, we will respond to it with the severity that is needed.

358
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,800
In a lot of cases right now, that is, we put it on the back burner, I suppose because of

359
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
the current issues.

360
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,540
If it's a major security issue, we do actually put out security patches, which we have done

361
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,880
a couple of times during this madness.

362
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,400
I understand that you might not wish to give that person's name, but if that person is

363
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,560
listening or that person receives this office hours recording later, even if you just spawn

364
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,480
it in a world in front of them, hi person who's reporting a security issue incorrectly,

365
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
please follow the security reporting.

366
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,320
I will not be mad at you if you make a security report about this particular issue.

367
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,400
Until you make a report about this issue, you are doing a disservice to Neos by not

368
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
reporting it.

369
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,320
Yeah, I saw a rumor on that one.

370
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
It's annoying.

371
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,920
There is, like, technically, and you can view it as a sort of keylog-ish thingy that exists,

372
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:52,480
which is the type delta node, but it's not going to get passed, I think.

373
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,280
They claim Logix, yeah, I've heard that Logix can also do remote access to people's computers.

374
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,600
I've also heard that Logix is a Bitcoin miner.

375
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
It's annoying.

376
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,720
They need to back up their claims of substantial evidence or reports to our team, otherwise

377
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,600
we can't really do anything about it.

378
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,360
I can add it to the Neos Wiki myth list, though, after this.

379
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,280
If this is like a magical Twitter hashtag I'm not reading, do let me know as well.

380
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,320
I have so many TweetDeck columns where I see VR chat players confused about Neos, and I'll

381
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,960
correct them.

382
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,600
I think the exploit of the day back when I last looked at the VR chat community talking

383
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,980
about it was that any user that joins you has access to your hard drive, and that's

384
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,520
because they didn't understand private UI versus public UI.

385
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,800
Strangely, and I'm going to say if you quote this without context, I will send an angry

386
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,120
cat, technically it was possible to access other people's hard drives inside of Neos

387
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,680
before I reported the issue in 2019-ish.

388
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:01,980
The old file browser existed in the uncategorized component list and it spawned into world space

389
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,360
by default and allowed people to interact with your hard drive.

390
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,200
Frux removed that quite quickly.

391
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,360
Additionally, there was also an exploit where you could write files to other people's hard

392
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
drives.

393
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,840
That got fixed and I reported it again quite quickly because it was reported correctly.

394
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,040
No, the write text to file node is the safe way to do it.

395
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,000
We had to ask for write text to file because Frux purged the easier way of doing it.

396
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,440
Write text to file is an amazing node which I need all the time and I actually use all

397
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,560
the time.

398
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,400
I run it only when I need to.

399
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:45,440
We run it in scientific applications all the time, but we have a mod for Neos which removes

400
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,680
the unsafe mode requirement for that node.

401
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:55,800
But by default, it can only run in unsafe sessions.

402
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,160
And for those who are unaware of the write text to file node, you need to go ahead and

403
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,400
inspect your logics tip and check the experimental check box which will show you experimental

404
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,960
nodes.

405
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:17,400
And for those who don't know what unsafe means, it is basically just land sessions.

406
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,760
For those who don't know what land sessions is, if I take a network cable and I plug it

407
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,440
into the router and I do take a network cable and plug it into the router and then you unplug

408
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,440
the internet from the router and you set up a session, then they can write files.

409
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,120
That's a land session.

410
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,280
It doesn't prevent you because you could be in a land session and in a non-land session.

411
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,240
It's just like the land session is over there.

412
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,640
No, it's the logics tip.

413
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
It's the logics tip.

414
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Look right here.

415
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
See?

416
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
It's the logics tip.

417
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
It's right there at the bottom.

418
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,720
Anyway, that's all the questions we have, so I'm going to go ahead and close it off

419
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
for today.

420
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,000
If you have any additional questions, concerns, comments, pictures of cheese, please feel

421
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,020
free to direct message me on posting the questions and help channel.

422
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,840
I see that we lost a bunch of people during that, so thank you all for listening.

423
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,200
Thank you to where are we?

424
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,520
Thank you to Apero Creations for being the guinea pig for the ask better questions rent.

425
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,720
I do believe there's actually a web page about asking better questions, so I will go ahead

426
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,960
and link that in.

427
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,280
There's a link on it, there it is, asking smart questions, that's what I was looking

428
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
for.

429
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,560
Unfortunately, it's huge, so like no one will read it because they just kept adding details

430
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
to it.

431
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,240
It's like it's a big thing.

432
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,360
Anyway, I will go see you guys later.

433
00:36:44,360 --> 00:37:13,320
Bye-bye.
