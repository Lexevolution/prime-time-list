0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.380
Okay, so welcome to office hours, it is the top of the hour, it is 4pm, if you have questions

2
0:00:04.380 --> 0:00:08.460
please feel free to drop them into the office hours chat, otherwise we're going to sit here

3
0:00:08.460 --> 0:00:10.060
and wait for questions.

4
0:00:10.060 --> 0:00:11.460
So let's get going.

5
0:00:11.460 --> 0:00:16.580
I see people type, excellent, I eat questions for breakfast, well it's actually 4pm so I

6
0:00:16.580 --> 0:00:22.220
eat questions for early dinner I guess, I did just eat, I have a cup of tea here, so

7
0:00:22.220 --> 0:00:26.460
I'm going to mute whilst I wait for questions and slurp on some tea.

8
0:00:26.460 --> 0:00:31.620
Speaking of slurping, are people aware of that meme with the guy that tastes ice cream?

9
0:00:31.620 --> 0:00:32.620
That's a good meme.

10
0:00:32.620 --> 0:00:36.520
I found the source of it, it's interesting, sometimes you just accidentally find the sources

11
0:00:36.520 --> 0:00:39.860
of memes and it's cool.

12
0:00:39.860 --> 0:00:50.100
So it's the chief ice cream tester at a creamery and his tongue is insured for a million dollars

13
0:00:50.100 --> 0:00:55.280
and he tests all the new flavours and I watched a documentary on ice cream making on the history

14
0:00:55.280 --> 0:00:57.820
channel that was uploaded to YouTube.

15
0:00:57.820 --> 0:01:03.740
And yeah, it's a meme, I found the origination accidentally and suddenly I was just faced

16
0:01:03.740 --> 0:01:12.860
with like, wait a minute, that's the ice cream guy, I'll get the video for you, here it is.

17
0:01:12.860 --> 0:01:18.740
This person uses a gold spoon because it leads to less aftertaste.

18
0:01:18.740 --> 0:01:25.060
I don't know what he means, if I eat at someone else's house or sometimes when I'm on vacation

19
0:01:25.060 --> 0:01:29.380
and I use other cutlery that's not mine, food will taste slightly different if I've been

20
0:01:29.380 --> 0:01:36.820
eating it with my cutlery, I realised I'd eaten more cutlery and so I ordered more but

21
0:01:36.820 --> 0:01:40.580
I ordered more of a different type and so now my cutlery drawer is mixed with cutlery.

22
0:01:40.580 --> 0:01:43.900
Why are we talking about food spoons, let's move on.

23
0:01:43.900 --> 0:01:48.100
So a question from Holy which is which tea flavour, currently El Grey, it's probably

24
0:01:48.100 --> 0:01:52.880
a little bit late for caffeine but you can't stop me, I forgot to filter the water though

25
0:01:52.880 --> 0:01:54.380
so it's a bit there.

26
0:01:54.380 --> 0:01:59.380
Okay now an actual legitimate question, isn't it about ice cream cutlery or tea, come Griffin

27
0:01:59.380 --> 0:02:00.380
thank you.

28
0:02:00.380 --> 0:02:04.320
I've noticed that sometimes my avatar import will not add an eye manager when selected,

29
0:02:04.320 --> 0:02:09.620
what might cause this if it's put here, it's put it on before but lately I've also been

30
0:02:09.620 --> 0:02:12.340
checking the box for face tracking setup.

31
0:02:12.340 --> 0:02:17.900
It might occur that it doesn't get put on if it can't find your eyes, so similar to

32
0:02:17.900 --> 0:02:23.580
like the other bone related structures, if it can't find them then it doesn't do that,

33
0:02:23.580 --> 0:02:28.340
like for example if you rig a model that doesn't have hands that conform to our requirements

34
0:02:28.340 --> 0:02:32.460
then it won't add the hand stuff, like it'll still allow you to move your arms and your

35
0:02:32.460 --> 0:02:37.500
hands but it won't then do finger tracking, who was it that had that issue?

36
0:02:37.500 --> 0:02:41.900
I think it was someone that was importing one of the Risk of Rain characters, the Lemurians,

37
0:02:41.900 --> 0:02:46.980
like just the standard sort of like stand up sort of animalistic looking characters,

38
0:02:46.980 --> 0:02:51.700
they don't really have fingers or correct fingers so they just, it just doesn't get

39
0:02:51.700 --> 0:02:54.480
set up so do check to keep an eye on that.

40
0:02:54.480 --> 0:02:58.420
So Bean, thank you for typing your question, I guess my one question is when you're planning

41
0:02:58.420 --> 0:03:02.140
implementing an option to disable post-processing, some of my friends have epilepsy, can't join

42
0:03:02.140 --> 0:03:08.580
because the post-processing is hurting their eyes, will there be a better GUI, hi, struggling

43
0:03:08.580 --> 0:03:13.060
with my words today, will there be a better GUI for desktop users so drawing shapes is

44
0:03:13.060 --> 0:03:17.380
easy, building is fun but it's difficult and I've tried the real, okay, lots of questions

45
0:03:17.380 --> 0:03:21.260
there, so if it says disabling post-processing, that's actually blocked on like two separate

46
0:03:21.260 --> 0:03:22.260
things.

47
0:03:22.260 --> 0:03:25.340
So number one is like we are trying to change up our graphical engine to make it easier

48
0:03:25.340 --> 0:03:30.260
to do stuff like that for you, until we do that, we don't really want to invest a time

49
0:03:30.260 --> 0:03:31.260
in that.

50
0:03:31.260 --> 0:03:36.060
I'm aware that it's bad, I would love to provide the ability to disable it but we've just made

51
0:03:36.060 --> 0:03:41.340
the sort of stance that we need to focus our efforts elsewhere right now and then the second

52
0:03:41.340 --> 0:03:44.700
one there is our settings UI, if you go to our settings tab, it's just a mess, like it's

53
0:03:44.700 --> 0:03:50.980
a mess, like it's one of the worst parts of our UI, we can't go on with that settings

54
0:03:50.980 --> 0:03:55.460
UI so we want to update that such that there is more room for settings and when I say settings

55
0:03:55.460 --> 0:03:58.740
or the settings, at which point it'll be like hey you want settings, we've got settings,

56
0:03:58.740 --> 0:04:01.740
I hope we have a way to like hide and show certain settings, otherwise like we're just

57
0:04:01.740 --> 0:04:08.060
going to end up with like setting soup again but that'll then also allow those features.

58
0:04:08.060 --> 0:04:13.020
That's all I've already got for you, I'm interesting to hear like which particular part of post-processing

59
0:04:13.020 --> 0:04:18.740
is the problem, is it the bloom, I wouldn't imagine it would be the AO but I could understand

60
0:04:18.740 --> 0:04:21.420
if the bloom is doing it.

61
0:04:21.420 --> 0:04:27.060
As for your second question about drawing, have you tried, oh no you're talking about

62
0:04:27.060 --> 0:04:31.280
desktop drawing, yeah for desktop drawing I'm not sure, desktop mode is of course supported

63
0:04:31.280 --> 0:04:36.980
right now but like it's unclear what like the next priority in improving that will be,

64
0:04:36.980 --> 0:04:43.220
I know that we need to get better sort of naturalistification, that's not a word but

65
0:04:43.220 --> 0:04:48.700
like you know what I mean, going for desktop users so they don't just look flat, for example

66
0:04:48.700 --> 0:04:52.600
I see a lot of avatars where they're in desktop and their hands are at their sides but they're

67
0:04:52.600 --> 0:04:58.940
at their sides without any sort of consideration about how wide the character is and so they're

68
0:04:58.940 --> 0:05:03.620
like their hands are just sort of like in their belly or in their thighs just like hanging

69
0:05:03.620 --> 0:05:07.620
there like straight, if we could get like some sort of natural animations going there

70
0:05:07.620 --> 0:05:13.820
I think that would be a lot more appreciated than them staying like that, so there's lots

71
0:05:13.820 --> 0:05:17.660
of like desktop things that we need to look at, same with like walking, posing, stuff

72
0:05:17.660 --> 0:05:23.220
like that, like VRChat does it where there are different, like there are different animations

73
0:05:23.220 --> 0:05:28.660
by default but you can also kind of customize those, now we won't have animation support

74
0:05:28.660 --> 0:05:36.540
in the same way that VRChat does because we know we're not unity but like they do have

75
0:05:36.540 --> 0:05:40.940
better default animations for desktop based avatars where their hands are out to the side,

76
0:05:40.940 --> 0:05:44.260
it's almost like a like a sneaky look from a video game like you're sneaking but like

77
0:05:44.260 --> 0:05:49.540
you know it does like make it look a bit better, like I always say like it's obvious if someone

78
0:05:49.540 --> 0:05:54.280
is in desktop because of those like animations but yeah the reason why I mention hand posing

79
0:05:54.280 --> 0:05:59.700
is because that's usually the problem right, so you just like the tool comes out of your

80
0:05:59.700 --> 0:06:03.860
hand and then your hand goes wonky, to me it like might be better if like we had an

81
0:06:03.860 --> 0:06:08.780
option for like the tool to just be attached to your face, you have like because of your

82
0:06:08.780 --> 0:06:11.980
mouse you've got ultimate control over your face like if you could just draw over your

83
0:06:11.980 --> 0:06:17.860
face you'd basically be back to like a regular drawing experience, I remember those days

84
0:06:17.860 --> 0:06:21.580
where I can't figure out if I'm warm or cold so I put on a sweater now I'm gonna mute and

85
0:06:21.580 --> 0:06:24.940
take off a sweater whilst the next questions are typed, keep those questions coming on

86
0:06:24.940 --> 0:06:28.240
just imagine primary moving a sweater that's all that's happening right now, and I'm back

87
0:06:28.240 --> 0:06:32.480
because there's another question, so NFT Hater says try to import an avatar in Eos but the

88
0:06:32.480 --> 0:06:37.120
arms feel way too short, how to fix it, so if you inspect the root of the avatar, I can

89
0:06:37.120 --> 0:06:40.780
never remember these, they're luckily they're on the same slot so you can just scroll through

90
0:06:40.780 --> 0:06:46.700
them, it's either VRIK or VRIK avatar I can never remember which they're named terribly

91
0:06:46.700 --> 0:06:52.980
I hate them, on one of those components you'll find properties about the arms and on those

92
0:06:52.980 --> 0:06:59.860
arms will be arm length multiplier, arm length multiplier allows you to if you overdrive

93
0:06:59.860 --> 0:07:04.340
it have like spaghetti arms but I don't advise that because it kind of like pushes your chest

94
0:07:04.340 --> 0:07:08.380
back at those levels but you can tweak it a little bit and it will give you longer arms

95
0:07:08.380 --> 0:07:14.700
I do that frequently as I am ginormous and you know my arms are really long so I need

96
0:07:14.700 --> 0:07:21.480
to sort of do that for my use, good way to test if you need to do that is to in VR extend

97
0:07:21.480 --> 0:07:27.660
your arm until your actual avatar arm stops moving and then stretch and see what happens

98
0:07:27.660 --> 0:07:32.940
right you can almost see especially if you've got the SteamVR overlay open you can see that

99
0:07:32.940 --> 0:07:37.100
the controller goes further but your arm stops if you see that then you should tweak the

100
0:07:37.100 --> 0:07:42.500
arm length multiplier so that those line up I always like do I touch the top of my head

101
0:07:42.500 --> 0:07:46.240
then I touch my elbow or my shoulder now it's not gonna be good in terms of angle but it

102
0:07:46.240 --> 0:07:49.620
should be good in terms of position because we don't have like elbow tracking unless you

103
0:07:49.620 --> 0:07:53.980
got the trackers for it we don't have elbow tracking so there's no way to like you know

104
0:07:53.980 --> 0:08:00.140
do that moving onwards Gran Griffin asks is making a model double-sided causing meaningful

105
0:08:00.140 --> 0:08:06.780
performance difference I believe that it actually doubles the vertices if it doubles the vertices

106
0:08:06.780 --> 0:08:11.100
and of course it doubles the the you know the diversity count of the model if it doesn't

107
0:08:11.100 --> 0:08:19.780
divert doesn't double them then no performance impact therefore wherever possible I would

108
0:08:19.780 --> 0:08:27.060
recommend instead using the PBS dual sided or turning off the culling option on the 62

109
0:08:27.060 --> 0:08:31.660
when you do that make sure you give the model a good look around there are some times where

110
0:08:31.660 --> 0:08:36.940
like having no culling just makes everything look really really weird and that's because

111
0:08:36.940 --> 0:08:41.260
like if you've got faces that are like really intersecting and then having them doubled

112
0:08:41.260 --> 0:08:45.980
up could just do to like just sort of impossible geometry and stuff it's in that a couple of

113
0:08:45.980 --> 0:08:50.300
times of like hair or fur on some avatars where you double-side it and everything just

114
0:08:50.300 --> 0:08:55.820
looks weird I like the like new way that a lot of like new avatars with fur doing it

115
0:08:55.820 --> 0:09:03.180
where they kind of like they sculpt sort of triangle cones into the actual mesh rather

116
0:09:03.180 --> 0:09:10.300
than doing the old approach which is like opacity like single-sided opacity excluded

117
0:09:10.300 --> 0:09:15.460
like triangles and stuff because that way you don't have those issues gun Griffin second

118
0:09:15.460 --> 0:09:18.580
question says what other settings are relevant for calibrating an avatar where do you find

119
0:09:18.580 --> 0:09:23.140
them in hierarchy all right so there is a lot in the root of the avatar vrk vrk avatar

120
0:09:23.140 --> 0:09:27.700
I have a lot there in particular look at the gate system if someone like figures out the

121
0:09:27.700 --> 0:09:33.820
gate system and comes up with a good standard for the gate system like you'll get so much

122
0:09:33.820 --> 0:09:39.140
cake because like I know people like lots of people don't like the standard gates but

123
0:09:39.140 --> 0:09:42.220
they didn't realize they can edit them everyone's like oh I wish you know you could just add

124
0:09:42.220 --> 0:09:47.860
an animation for walking you can edit the gate system in my editing of the gate system

125
0:09:47.860 --> 0:09:53.180
I made myself leapfrog and regardless of like both feet were like stuck together and I would

126
0:09:53.180 --> 0:09:57.660
just like hop forwards and then I increased the speed of that and I turned my feet into

127
0:09:57.660 --> 0:10:03.740
like a jackhammer and it just was like you know boom boom boom boom boom because like

128
0:10:03.740 --> 0:10:09.020
I increased the amount of steps per like meter and that was a really cool thing I then made

129
0:10:09.020 --> 0:10:15.140
my like strides really big and we went from goose stepping which is like an historical

130
0:10:15.140 --> 0:10:19.940
march that German soldiers used to do I believe I'm not a historian but I remember goose stepping

131
0:10:19.940 --> 0:10:25.100
being a sort of like meme about Germany or something in history lesson I don't remember

132
0:10:25.100 --> 0:10:30.680
all the way to what I'm just gonna call sort of ballet leaping you know when a ballet dancer

133
0:10:30.680 --> 0:10:35.100
leaps forward with their leg outstretched that was again gate settings that I did so

134
0:10:35.100 --> 0:10:41.820
if you want different walking animations gates there's a lots of stuff there I don't know

135
0:10:41.820 --> 0:10:47.940
what half of them do my best bet is to like mess with them I remember like a notable example

136
0:10:47.940 --> 0:10:53.780
that comes to mind is when I imported one particular avatar its butt would stick out

137
0:10:53.780 --> 0:10:57.860
right it was like almost having a hunch back but it was because the butt was just stuck

138
0:10:57.860 --> 0:11:02.360
out too much and I went to Delirious Jacks community member here and I just said like

139
0:11:02.360 --> 0:11:08.100
I think you fixed the butt sticking for someone else do you mind having a look and they said

140
0:11:08.100 --> 0:11:11.740
I don't know how to fix it but I'll work on it with you and we just played with a bunch

141
0:11:11.740 --> 0:11:19.420
of settings and then my butt was unstuck out there's also a github issue by what's that

142
0:11:19.420 --> 0:11:24.820
like bright color Diwali that has eye tracking I can't remember their name anyway they made

143
0:11:24.820 --> 0:11:32.460
a github issue which had some recommended default value changes so they were like proposing

144
0:11:32.460 --> 0:11:39.500
that Neos make changes to the default values for your IK to fix some issues that they noticed

145
0:11:39.500 --> 0:11:47.380
I point people towards those because we can't implement those by ourselves right now because

146
0:11:47.380 --> 0:11:51.940
we're not sure on the implications for all avatars but if you make those changes and

147
0:11:51.940 --> 0:11:58.220
you have good use with them then fantastic and make sure to thank them yeah properties

148
0:11:58.220 --> 0:12:02.220
linked it thank you so much it's it's Grox yeah I was right the colorful of Ali without

149
0:12:02.220 --> 0:12:07.700
with eye tracking they're all they're all named sort of like approximately okay you

150
0:12:07.700 --> 0:12:12.620
know I'm just looking at the issue now like body rot stiffness basically means like the

151
0:12:12.620 --> 0:12:18.500
rotation stiffness but it isn't clear to me like what I should edit that to like compare

152
0:12:18.500 --> 0:12:23.460
that to say like temperature right and you can turn the degrees up on your thermostat

153
0:12:23.460 --> 0:12:30.140
to be hot or cold that's really obvious what you want to do the same with maybe you know

154
0:12:30.140 --> 0:12:34.580
like a faucet you know you want to turn it like I want more water or less water but like

155
0:12:34.580 --> 0:12:40.580
with this when you change these numbers it's like I don't know 0.1 is better I care yay

156
0:12:40.580 --> 0:12:48.700
and 0.15 is Cthulhu basically so you just don't know you just gotta play with them it

157
0:12:48.700 --> 0:12:55.700
depends on your on your exact avatar so we'll move on I would love to get all of those documented

158
0:12:55.700 --> 0:12:59.900
I would love for like I love like a video of them actually I you know if someone was

159
0:12:59.900 --> 0:13:05.780
basically just like went through them all in turn and was like here is body rotate stiffness

160
0:13:05.780 --> 0:13:09.620
if you said it low you'll look like this if you said it high you look like this we recommend

161
0:13:09.620 --> 0:13:13.140
it looking like this I'd love that kind of video of course that would probably need to

162
0:13:13.140 --> 0:13:18.140
be done for like most avatar types and what I mean by that is like of course most of us

163
0:13:18.140 --> 0:13:22.240
are humanoids still but like there's different sort of ways of doing humanoid hence the sort

164
0:13:22.240 --> 0:13:28.340
of butt sticking out problem also stuff like that so it might be good to sort of have recommendations

165
0:13:28.340 --> 0:13:33.580
based on certain avatars based on that so my advice there is basically play with it

166
0:13:33.580 --> 0:13:37.980
just have fun there's so much there though if you if you're frustrated with the IK like

167
0:13:37.980 --> 0:13:41.620
unless you've played with all of those settings be a little bit less frustrated I mean still

168
0:13:41.620 --> 0:13:45.220
be frustrated because the settings already up juice but what I mean by that is I can't

169
0:13:45.220 --> 0:13:50.340
change this maybe you can please try I have no idea how half the work Bean has another

170
0:13:50.340 --> 0:13:54.580
idea thank you I got idea for some things they say for the building and drawing in desktop

171
0:13:54.580 --> 0:13:58.860
mode it would act like a puppet from a little big planet you can control the cursor directly

172
0:13:58.860 --> 0:14:02.780
with a line corresponding connecting occurs to the avatar you can choose to draw with

173
0:14:02.780 --> 0:14:06.620
the mouse or with the movement keys or to follow a layer based system unless you present

174
0:14:06.620 --> 0:14:10.500
key to set it freeform so the avatar system and the clipping issues have a tool they would

175
0:14:10.500 --> 0:14:15.620
posture editor yeah postured it's a really good thing I think we need more sort of in-built

176
0:14:15.620 --> 0:14:23.940
avatar tools so like for a bunch of like users they they set up systems by themselves I'm

177
0:14:23.940 --> 0:14:28.300
trying to think of example so gestures is a good example like Neos could have an in-built

178
0:14:28.300 --> 0:14:34.220
gesture editor the sort of like head pat logics with activities blend shapes we could have

179
0:14:34.220 --> 0:14:40.420
that built-in poses animations and gates we could have like a really smooth UI for that

180
0:14:40.420 --> 0:14:44.740
we could also have presets for the gate system you know when you set up your avatar there's

181
0:14:44.740 --> 0:14:48.260
like a question I don't know about the UI but like maybe there's like a sort of questionnaire

182
0:14:48.260 --> 0:14:54.180
and it's like do you want your avatar to move heavy plodding like they're a large you know

183
0:14:54.180 --> 0:14:58.860
just thinking of like a large boss from Dark Souls you want to move like a large box from

184
0:14:58.860 --> 0:15:02.940
Dark Souls or do you want them to move like a ballerina right and go between those two

185
0:15:02.940 --> 0:15:09.020
options and see how they move we could even do an animation of your avatar similar to

186
0:15:09.020 --> 0:15:12.840
how the full body tracker does where it's in front of you and just walking on a treadmill

187
0:15:12.840 --> 0:15:16.740
and say like ah do you want to tweak it walk it on a treadmill walk on a treadmill I actually

188
0:15:16.740 --> 0:15:20.700
have a world where you hit a button it duplicates your avatar and walks you on a treadmill I

189
0:15:20.700 --> 0:15:25.420
just haven't like released that that was called my gate editor world I just haven't finished

190
0:15:25.420 --> 0:15:32.580
it um uh then going for the the drawing have you tried the free camera mode it sounds similar

191
0:15:32.580 --> 0:15:35.400
like I haven't played a little bit planet I did want to play a little bit planet but

192
0:15:35.400 --> 0:15:40.700
like I couldn't afford a ps3 so I skipped ps3 I could afford a ps4 sat next to me I

193
0:15:40.700 --> 0:15:45.100
haven't used it in like three years but it sat next to me um it sounds a little bit like

194
0:15:45.100 --> 0:15:49.460
the free camera mode the layering system for drawing is is interesting there are tools

195
0:15:49.460 --> 0:15:52.820
that can kind of help you with that but a lot of those tools don't work too well in

196
0:15:52.820 --> 0:15:58.620
desktop I'll certainly take a look at that feedback um scrolling down past the uh gligrocks

197
0:15:58.620 --> 0:16:03.020
issue uh I'd like to pose a sort of benchmark when they're in those changes new performance

198
0:16:03.020 --> 0:16:08.620
wise I don't think we need like performance testing with those VR um ik changes none of

199
0:16:08.620 --> 0:16:13.660
those should have performance uh benefits or improvements or anything like that um basically

200
0:16:13.660 --> 0:16:17.940
all those values that you're editing are already being calculated every step and every movement

201
0:16:17.940 --> 0:16:21.380
um so changing them doesn't really change how fast the calculation takes it just changes

202
0:16:21.380 --> 0:16:26.140
what the the animation looks like um I know if it wants to do a bunch of um updates to

203
0:16:26.140 --> 0:16:31.300
the ik system anyway that is where the performance lies um that's also a lot of cases that happens

204
0:16:31.300 --> 0:16:35.340
with a lot of other things as well people worry too much about stuff which we can fix

205
0:16:35.340 --> 0:16:41.900
for them they're like this node is is kind of bad like well we can fix it like maybe

206
0:16:41.900 --> 0:16:45.860
don't avoid it we can fix it please open an issue let us know that there's a problem with

207
0:16:45.860 --> 0:16:53.340
that node uh unnamed cyborg cat says um can one import dot blend files into neos yes um

208
0:16:53.340 --> 0:16:59.620
uh usually what will happen there is uh when you do that neos will try to find your blender

209
0:16:59.620 --> 0:17:03.140
installation so make sure you have blender installed if you can't find your blender installation

210
0:17:03.140 --> 0:17:08.000
I don't think it works so maybe it'll do a full back um and then it will basically like

211
0:17:08.000 --> 0:17:13.820
run a command line program with a version of blender to export that as an fpx file but

212
0:17:13.820 --> 0:17:18.140
you can do it um you might have mixed results doing it I know some people like doing it

213
0:17:18.140 --> 0:17:20.820
because it works for them I don't know some people don't like it because it doesn't work

214
0:17:20.820 --> 0:17:25.060
for them just just try it out uh Tony says is there a way to disable ik when in full

215
0:17:25.060 --> 0:17:30.660
body not sure um you do still need some of it and the reason why you still need some

216
0:17:30.660 --> 0:17:36.580
of it is because with ik um we can say hey your foot is here because we have your foot

217
0:17:36.580 --> 0:17:43.060
tracker but that doesn't mean we know where your knee is so we need to inverse kinematics

218
0:17:43.060 --> 0:17:47.380
where your knee is or where your hip joint is and yeah you might have trackers for all

219
0:17:47.380 --> 0:17:53.820
those places but like there's still calculations that need to be done moving forwards elm elm

220
0:17:53.820 --> 0:17:58.000
now says no says uh is it possible to kick something if you're tracking over foot yes

221
0:17:58.000 --> 0:18:04.500
uh you could set that up um there are like there are colliders on your feet but they're

222
0:18:04.500 --> 0:18:10.940
not like defaultly set up to interact like that you would need to um add some custom

223
0:18:10.940 --> 0:18:15.420
stuff to that um you would probably need to put an active collider on your foot I'm gonna

224
0:18:15.420 --> 0:18:19.260
say this now I'm gonna say this forever because people keep mistaking this active colliders

225
0:18:19.260 --> 0:18:24.900
are fine provided you follow like a couple of uh assurances you'll be absolutely fine

226
0:18:24.900 --> 0:18:29.660
don't worry about them too much um but yeah it's possible to set up but not like easy

227
0:18:29.660 --> 0:18:33.860
to explain how to set up uh particularly when we don't have physics like once we have physics

228
0:18:33.860 --> 0:18:36.780
I believe we'll see much more of that stuff because we'll have people playing football

229
0:18:36.780 --> 0:18:45.740
and stuff like that uh moving onwards ah yes so froppy says uh f6 is free cam um neota

230
0:18:45.740 --> 0:18:50.140
shop is uh also an option I'm sure if you know about that bean um so go to essential

231
0:18:50.140 --> 0:18:53.780
tools polylogics tools and then go through the options there one's called poly uh called

232
0:18:53.780 --> 0:18:58.500
for uh neota shop and there's a picture from froppy probably so helpful everyone everyone

233
0:18:58.500 --> 0:19:02.980
like everyone given a round of what's the froppy gunn griffin asks what's the best way

234
0:19:02.980 --> 0:19:07.920
to invert a boolean using components I'm not sure I wouldn't use components oh you can

235
0:19:07.920 --> 0:19:13.580
use a boolean value driver um boolean value driver bool and that way you can do it sometimes

236
0:19:13.580 --> 0:19:20.300
I do do that but I don't usually try to do it because it's a bit like finicky um so boolean

237
0:19:20.300 --> 0:19:26.860
value driver bool has the state variable and then a true value and a false value so for

238
0:19:26.860 --> 0:19:31.500
the true value you do off for the false value you do on and then you effectively invert

239
0:19:31.500 --> 0:19:37.320
it froppy again who needs a another round of applause uh and then we have another question

240
0:19:37.320 --> 0:19:42.500
from renamed from an fd hater to unnamed cyborg cat does need to have a traditional programming

241
0:19:42.500 --> 0:19:46.940
which just logics just logics right now we might have a text-based language at some point

242
0:19:46.940 --> 0:19:50.940
um you can look at our plugin system if you wish to write actual code but right now it's

243
0:19:50.940 --> 0:19:55.060
just logics I didn't mention this clearly before but I do need to leave directly at

244
0:19:55.060 --> 0:19:59.300
half past so uh make sure you keep your eye on the time we've got two more minutes for

245
0:19:59.300 --> 0:20:04.380
questions I want to say like quinn it's like what's a quinnit uh bean says I should probably

246
0:20:04.380 --> 0:20:07.520
do a stream one day showing how a little bit planet does level building I could emulate

247
0:20:07.520 --> 0:20:11.720
it uh yeah if you send me a video like drop it into my dms I'll take a look and then maybe

248
0:20:11.720 --> 0:20:15.340
we can uh figure out a solution for you the reason for the tight schedule I'm apartment

249
0:20:15.340 --> 0:20:19.900
hunting right now and I need to get back to it otherwise I'll be homeless I mean I won't

250
0:20:19.900 --> 0:20:23.520
be like I can afford home apartments and everything like that it's just my lease is running out

251
0:20:23.520 --> 0:20:27.220
and I don't have a new lease that's all folks if you have questions please feel free to

252
0:20:27.220 --> 0:20:31.780
drop them in my dms and I'll get back to you as soon as I can see you again next week and

253
0:20:31.780 --> 0:20:57.980
I'll post this on sound later bye-bye
