0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.600
Okay, welcome to Prime Time, which is the office hours, or AMA with Prime.

2
0:00:05.600 --> 0:00:08.760
For questions about Neos, please drop your questions in the office hours chat if you

3
0:00:08.760 --> 0:00:09.760
have any questions.

4
0:00:09.760 --> 0:00:15.200
Otherwise we're going to sit here in unimaginably uncomfortable silence until there are questions.

5
0:00:15.200 --> 0:00:19.400
Okay, our first question is from Storm, and unfortunately not something I can answer.

6
0:00:19.400 --> 0:00:25.000
So Storm asks, how does Neos generate light colour and brightness using a skybox?

7
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:27.840
I have no idea, that's a question for games.

8
0:00:27.840 --> 0:00:32.840
I can guess, and I know technically what I would do to set up a world to look like how

9
0:00:32.840 --> 0:00:38.880
I would want it to look, but I don't know with enough technical detail to answer that

10
0:00:38.880 --> 0:00:40.080
correctly.

11
0:00:40.080 --> 0:00:41.080
So I won't.

12
0:00:41.080 --> 0:00:45.720
Alright, we have another question from Mystic, as noted, we can have awkward silence when

13
0:00:45.720 --> 0:00:50.640
there are no questions, that's just how office hours go!

14
0:00:50.640 --> 0:00:56.640
So the question is from Mystic, how is documentation going as of recent, and as far as Patreon

15
0:00:56.640 --> 0:01:03.040
section goes, there's a few ways it's phrased, patron benefits to patron tiers.

16
0:01:03.040 --> 0:01:12.040
If you see something that is not unified, then you're free to unify it.

17
0:01:12.040 --> 0:01:19.440
It's a wiki, like so many people are like, I can't edit the wiki, I'm a lowly person

18
0:01:19.440 --> 0:01:23.140
in the metaverse, so anyone can edit the wiki, if you want to go for it, there's no planned

19
0:01:23.140 --> 0:01:29.520
updates to the Patreon, there probably will be a big update eventually, but like, you

20
0:01:29.520 --> 0:01:34.200
know, that will be once we get more things cleared up.

21
0:01:34.200 --> 0:01:38.800
As for like generically documentation, honestly, lots of stuff is on pause, we're still working

22
0:01:38.800 --> 0:01:43.560
on the stuff that we can work on, other stuff we can't work on, see announcements.

23
0:01:43.560 --> 0:01:47.520
Yeah, we're not working on big update marketplace, for example.

24
0:01:47.520 --> 0:01:48.520
So that's that question.

25
0:01:48.520 --> 0:01:56.040
Moving onwards, NFThater has a question here, which is, oh, I should just, the answer to

26
0:01:56.040 --> 0:02:00.040
the question about graphics and rendering, yeah, it's asking, I have no idea.

27
0:02:00.040 --> 0:02:05.240
I know what I would do if I was building a particular world for a particular scene, but

28
0:02:05.240 --> 0:02:07.160
I don't know technically how it's done.

29
0:02:07.160 --> 0:02:10.420
There is a lot of stuff like that in Neos, where I'm like, I don't know technically how

30
0:02:10.420 --> 0:02:14.960
this works, but if you just like, tinker with it, then you'll figure it out.

31
0:02:14.960 --> 0:02:18.840
Like for example here, like particle systems, people ask, like, have you done a tutorial

32
0:02:18.840 --> 0:02:20.180
on particle systems yet?

33
0:02:20.180 --> 0:02:23.840
And I always say like, no, and the reason is honestly, because I just tinker with all

34
0:02:23.840 --> 0:02:25.520
the values until it looks right.

35
0:02:25.520 --> 0:02:31.680
So moving back to NFThater's question now, I know I'm circling around a little bit.

36
0:02:31.680 --> 0:02:34.920
Is it possible to browse the web in Neos?

37
0:02:34.920 --> 0:02:43.440
There is a roadmap item for that, it includes in-game documentation that won't require browsing

38
0:02:43.440 --> 0:02:48.680
the web, that's something I'm super excited about, but there will also be a way to sort

39
0:02:48.680 --> 0:02:54.640
of like view web pages and share them with other users in Neos eventually, so two things

40
0:02:54.640 --> 0:02:55.640
there.

41
0:02:55.640 --> 0:02:58.000
First one is to go look at the documentation roadmap on our GitHub that has a lot of sort

42
0:02:58.000 --> 0:03:02.240
of things that we want to do there, and then secondarily go ahead and look at screen sharing

43
0:03:02.240 --> 0:03:05.200
which will allow you to sort of drop screens in the world.

44
0:03:05.200 --> 0:03:09.480
Honestly though, I would rather right now, you just use the desktop tab of your dash,

45
0:03:09.480 --> 0:03:16.760
access overlay, desktop plus, OVR toolkit, so many different tools that can just drop

46
0:03:16.760 --> 0:03:18.880
documentation into the world.

47
0:03:18.880 --> 0:03:22.880
They are a bit clunky, like they're all a bit clunky, honestly the best way would be,

48
0:03:22.880 --> 0:03:27.240
I don't know what this is going to look like, but like you know, you click on a logics node

49
0:03:27.240 --> 0:03:33.000
and somehow, some way it's just like, yo dude, this is how this logics node works, like you

50
0:03:33.000 --> 0:03:39.200
wouldn't need to go to the wiki or anything like that, we know what node you're selecting,

51
0:03:39.200 --> 0:03:43.640
what node your laser is on, we can just display the documentation for that particular node.

52
0:03:43.640 --> 0:03:45.760
So that solves that problem better.

53
0:03:45.760 --> 0:03:47.760
So there you go.

54
0:03:47.760 --> 0:03:50.880
Mystic asks, there's been an update in regards to your favorite cheese, I don't answer cheese

55
0:03:50.880 --> 0:03:53.080
questions at these office hours, these are about Neos.

56
0:03:53.080 --> 0:03:57.000
There is an AMA, but to be honest I get the cheese question every office hours and I'm

57
0:03:57.000 --> 0:04:00.840
kind of tired of answering it, so I don't answer cheese questions, like go read the

58
0:04:00.840 --> 0:04:01.840
previous notes.

59
0:04:01.840 --> 0:04:05.880
So we have another cheese related question, I don't answer cheese related questions.

60
0:04:05.880 --> 0:04:15.080
The mood of silence shouldn't be bad, it's always important to remember that office hours

61
0:04:15.080 --> 0:04:20.760
in academia, which is what these are loosely based on, are literally the professor saying

62
0:04:20.760 --> 0:04:23.000
my door is open, come visit me.

63
0:04:23.000 --> 0:04:27.560
And if no one visits them, they just drink a cup of tea, put their feet up on the couch

64
0:04:27.560 --> 0:04:33.280
and relax, eat some cheese maybe, so that's the way it is, right?

65
0:04:33.280 --> 0:04:37.000
An AMA is only an AMA when there are questions, if there are no questions, they don't happen,

66
0:04:37.000 --> 0:04:40.640
they just happen to be voice related.

67
0:04:40.640 --> 0:04:44.440
We have another question from Crusher here, which says is the performance impact of updating

68
0:04:44.440 --> 0:04:46.280
relays significant?

69
0:04:46.280 --> 0:04:47.860
Less than you would think.

70
0:04:47.860 --> 0:04:52.160
The advice I have for updating relays is use them if you think you need to use them, but

71
0:04:52.160 --> 0:04:54.960
once your logic is complete, try to remove them.

72
0:04:54.960 --> 0:04:59.040
A lot of problems I see with users and updating relays is when they use them with the transform

73
0:04:59.040 --> 0:05:01.000
nodes, and then they have an impulse chain.

74
0:05:01.000 --> 0:05:04.560
If you have an impulse chain that reads from the transform nodes, you often don't need

75
0:05:04.560 --> 0:05:05.960
the updating relay.

76
0:05:05.960 --> 0:05:09.960
It's difficult to explain about pictures and stuff like that, but there are lots of cases

77
0:05:09.960 --> 0:05:16.160
where people use an updating relay just so that the display node that they're using updates.

78
0:05:16.160 --> 0:05:20.880
In impulse flows, you don't need the display node, and so therefore you don't need it to

79
0:05:20.880 --> 0:05:25.760
update all the time, and you know that on an actual impulse, it will have the appropriate

80
0:05:25.760 --> 0:05:26.920
update.

81
0:05:26.920 --> 0:05:32.680
So hence my feedback of build the logics using the updating relay, and then consider removing

82
0:05:32.680 --> 0:05:37.360
it and seeing if the logic still works, and then you've evaluated if they're needed or

83
0:05:37.360 --> 0:05:38.360
not.

84
0:05:38.360 --> 0:05:41.820
That also leads to the second thing about that, which is if you need them, you need

85
0:05:41.820 --> 0:05:42.820
them.

86
0:05:42.820 --> 0:05:46.900
There is no way around it, so just add them, but make sure you do need them by building

87
0:05:46.900 --> 0:05:48.720
your logics and then removing them.

88
0:05:48.720 --> 0:05:53.360
Mattie asks, updating relay refers to the specific node type and not the little logics

89
0:05:53.360 --> 0:05:55.840
needing block you get by grabbing a wire.

90
0:05:55.840 --> 0:05:57.360
Those don't have an impact.

91
0:05:57.360 --> 0:06:01.960
They do have an impact to slot count, but I'm going to say this incredibly loudly.

92
0:06:01.960 --> 0:06:04.600
Slots do not matter.

93
0:06:04.600 --> 0:06:09.280
The reason I say that is because high slot avatars, it's often not the problem that they

94
0:06:09.280 --> 0:06:10.280
have lots of slots.

95
0:06:10.280 --> 0:06:13.520
The reason that they have lots of slots is because they've put lots of functionality

96
0:06:13.520 --> 0:06:14.840
in the avatar.

97
0:06:14.840 --> 0:06:19.720
If you put less functionality in your avatar, then there will be less slots.

98
0:06:19.720 --> 0:06:22.360
So think about functionality before slots, basically.

99
0:06:22.360 --> 0:06:27.480
I've seen people that are like, you know, here's like a nuclear power plant of data

100
0:06:27.480 --> 0:06:31.080
above my head in my name badge, none of which is useful to me.

101
0:06:31.080 --> 0:06:36.000
Like, here's the time in my time zone, somewhat useful, here's the FPS, here's my heart rate,

102
0:06:36.000 --> 0:06:39.280
here's my heart rate availability, here's my favorite type of cheese, here's the temperature

103
0:06:39.280 --> 0:06:44.240
that exists in my time zone, here's my CPU rendering time, my battery percentage, none

104
0:06:44.240 --> 0:06:46.520
of which of course they can see because it's above in their name badge.

105
0:06:46.520 --> 0:06:52.160
I don't care what your batteries are, if they run out, you can, cool, go charge them.

106
0:06:52.160 --> 0:06:55.240
So just consider what features you're putting into an object and then your slot count will

107
0:06:55.240 --> 0:06:57.320
naturally go down and then they won't matter.

108
0:06:57.320 --> 0:07:02.680
So relays, no problem, updating relays, test if you need them at the end of your logics.

109
0:07:02.680 --> 0:07:06.600
So next we have a question from Revy who says, how do Patreon rewards get handled when you

110
0:07:06.600 --> 0:07:07.600
cancel Patreon?

111
0:07:07.600 --> 0:07:10.720
Heard from some that you get to keep your storage tier, I want to know if it's true.

112
0:07:10.720 --> 0:07:14.480
Asking since as far as I know, all the Patreon money still goes to Carol, which not something

113
0:07:14.480 --> 0:07:16.720
I want to support for a while now.

114
0:07:16.720 --> 0:07:20.800
I've been meaning to, I keep forgetting to due to current circumstances and volunteers,

115
0:07:20.800 --> 0:07:26.800
et cetera, update the Patreon page to just clarify that statement, you know, what happens

116
0:07:26.800 --> 0:07:30.320
when you stop doing Patreon.

117
0:07:30.320 --> 0:07:37.520
What I will know and will can tell you is that we never delete data.

118
0:07:37.520 --> 0:07:39.440
So we're never going to delete stuff.

119
0:07:39.440 --> 0:07:43.120
If you, for example, have a storage tier that gives you 40 gigabytes and you use all 40

120
0:07:43.120 --> 0:07:46.200
gigabytes, we're never going to delete that data, we're going to let you keep it.

121
0:07:46.200 --> 0:07:49.960
You won't be able to write, but you will be able to read.

122
0:07:49.960 --> 0:07:52.260
You don't use the appropriate technology there.

123
0:07:52.260 --> 0:07:56.360
The next billing cycle, you'll lose the storage.

124
0:07:56.360 --> 0:07:59.360
Certain things like groups will not be removed.

125
0:07:59.360 --> 0:08:03.180
The Patreon badge will also not be removed, neither will the wizard badge.

126
0:08:03.180 --> 0:08:07.480
You keep a lot of stuff, but like other stuff that we actually have to pay money for, i.e.

127
0:08:07.480 --> 0:08:10.640
the storage, doesn't go away.

128
0:08:10.640 --> 0:08:12.840
So if we have to pay for it, it probably goes away.

129
0:08:12.840 --> 0:08:15.840
If we don't have to pay for it, it doesn't.

130
0:08:15.840 --> 0:08:20.600
Moving onwards to the next question, is there like a tutorial series for new users?

131
0:08:20.600 --> 0:08:21.760
Basically no clue to use it.

132
0:08:21.760 --> 0:08:23.400
There are multiple tutorial series.

133
0:08:23.400 --> 0:08:24.960
It depends on which one you want to see.

134
0:08:24.960 --> 0:08:30.520
I have 300 tutorials, but something which I don't do, almost sort of as a principle

135
0:08:30.520 --> 0:08:35.040
of my channel, is I don't do introduction series.

136
0:08:35.040 --> 0:08:39.840
The reason I haven't done introduction yet is because I want to wait until things like

137
0:08:39.840 --> 0:08:43.240
the UI update, the logics update are all done.

138
0:08:43.240 --> 0:08:45.880
Because otherwise my introduction series is going to be out of date.

139
0:08:45.880 --> 0:08:49.400
And if my introduction series is going to be out of date, it's going to be monumentally

140
0:08:49.400 --> 0:08:53.880
more frustrating than other tutorials that could be out of date.

141
0:08:53.880 --> 0:08:58.960
For example, if my how to make a gun in Neos tutorial is out of date, you would need to

142
0:08:58.960 --> 0:09:03.160
know how to use Neos from an introductory basic point of view before you even start

143
0:09:03.160 --> 0:09:08.560
making a gun, so you're more malleable and able to deal with stuff being out of date.

144
0:09:08.560 --> 0:09:12.480
I have quite a few videos on my channel, for example, that use the old dash, and people

145
0:09:12.480 --> 0:09:18.600
can kind of still figure out what's going on and map it to the new UI because they're

146
0:09:18.600 --> 0:09:21.080
familiar and because it's not a new introductory series.

147
0:09:21.080 --> 0:09:26.000
They're less prone to being affected by changes or being out of date.

148
0:09:26.000 --> 0:09:29.480
Whereas an introductory series will be out of date very quickly, because it needs to

149
0:09:29.480 --> 0:09:35.880
be day one, week one, moment one, and it needs to be as clear as possible in that regard.

150
0:09:35.880 --> 0:09:39.620
And I can't give that clarity right now, so it hasn't been done.

151
0:09:39.620 --> 0:09:41.840
Other users have done introductory tutorials.

152
0:09:41.840 --> 0:09:42.840
You can look them up.

153
0:09:42.840 --> 0:09:49.920
I actually have a link in the guideline, the info and welcome and links channel of this

154
0:09:49.920 --> 0:09:53.920
Discord, which links to a variety of channels which have tutorials.

155
0:09:53.920 --> 0:09:58.640
There's also a lot of tutorials in game made by various people.

156
0:09:58.640 --> 0:10:01.280
Some of those were MMC entries that talk you through it.

157
0:10:01.280 --> 0:10:06.880
Really though, if we don't have an official introductory series, my question usually there

158
0:10:06.880 --> 0:10:10.480
is what would you like to know, and then I can sort of narrow it down a little bit.

159
0:10:10.480 --> 0:10:12.920
There is no possible way for you to know everything.

160
0:10:12.920 --> 0:10:16.320
I promise you, you'll never know everything.

161
0:10:16.320 --> 0:10:17.320
It's not possible.

162
0:10:17.320 --> 0:10:19.240
I guess that helps.

163
0:10:19.240 --> 0:10:20.640
If you have any particular areas, let me know.

164
0:10:20.640 --> 0:10:23.000
I can follow up with some links from them.

165
0:10:23.000 --> 0:10:26.300
Specs asks, to follow up on the Patreon question, are you intended to keep the herdless server

166
0:10:26.300 --> 0:10:29.560
binary access of Patreon membership is canceled?

167
0:10:29.560 --> 0:10:31.940
I don't know either way, yes or no.

168
0:10:31.940 --> 0:10:35.300
I don't know why we still have that lock behind Patreon.

169
0:10:35.300 --> 0:10:37.080
I'd like to review that.

170
0:10:37.080 --> 0:10:41.640
I don't know why many of our test features are locked behind Patreon.

171
0:10:41.640 --> 0:10:43.240
Testing things should be free.

172
0:10:43.240 --> 0:10:45.040
I don't understand.

173
0:10:45.040 --> 0:10:49.360
Neos won't prevent you from using files you've already acquired.

174
0:10:49.360 --> 0:10:52.040
So you don't need to delete it or anything.

175
0:10:52.040 --> 0:10:56.160
I also think it's problematic for like headless server operators, that they're like, well,

176
0:10:56.160 --> 0:11:02.600
I need to have a Patreon access to run servers for Neos, even though I'm not playing Neos,

177
0:11:02.600 --> 0:11:04.160
I'm just running servers for it.

178
0:11:04.160 --> 0:11:06.380
So I don't know.

179
0:11:06.380 --> 0:11:07.380
We need to review that.

180
0:11:07.380 --> 0:11:09.620
We just can't right now, given the circumstances.

181
0:11:09.620 --> 0:11:12.180
I would love that for like we just had it open.

182
0:11:12.180 --> 0:11:16.380
It would put more interest and more attention on that, but that's fine.

183
0:11:16.380 --> 0:11:17.680
That's what testing is for.

184
0:11:17.680 --> 0:11:18.680
Like remember danger testers?

185
0:11:18.680 --> 0:11:22.480
It was like, hey, guys, we need testers to test this broken build.

186
0:11:22.480 --> 0:11:26.480
People are like, cool, here's a broken build.

187
0:11:26.480 --> 0:11:27.960
Let's test it and let's give feedback.

188
0:11:27.960 --> 0:11:28.960
It's good.

189
0:11:28.960 --> 0:11:29.960
I don't understand.

190
0:11:29.960 --> 0:11:35.040
Anyway, let's not encourage that, because you should, you know, maybe at least once

191
0:11:35.040 --> 0:11:36.440
get that code.

192
0:11:36.440 --> 0:11:41.040
Do remember that the Patreon money is actually going towards server costs, and we do need

193
0:11:41.040 --> 0:11:43.080
those server costs to keep your storage.

194
0:11:43.080 --> 0:11:47.240
So yes, while you're uncertain about where your Patreon money is going right now, some

195
0:11:47.240 --> 0:11:53.700
of it at least does go for paying for the literal file storage that keeps your stuff

196
0:11:53.700 --> 0:11:55.120
on our systems.

197
0:11:55.120 --> 0:11:58.760
And so if everyone cancelled their Patreon, we might get to the point where we would actually

198
0:11:58.760 --> 0:12:00.160
start losing access to data.

199
0:12:00.160 --> 0:12:01.160
I don't mean losing data.

200
0:12:01.160 --> 0:12:02.880
I just mean losing access to data.

201
0:12:02.880 --> 0:12:08.920
What I mean by that is if you don't pay for the storage, the storage providers will usually

202
0:12:08.920 --> 0:12:15.800
do things like read only, a bit like we do, or here, download it, but you can't access

203
0:12:15.800 --> 0:12:19.120
it dynamically through APIs, which we do on the cloud systems.

204
0:12:19.120 --> 0:12:20.680
They're not going to delete it either.

205
0:12:20.680 --> 0:12:22.480
At least not initially.

206
0:12:22.480 --> 0:12:23.840
Just keep that in mind.

207
0:12:23.840 --> 0:12:32.960
Like, hey, you've got thousands of gigabytes of fursonas or avatars on your cloud storage,

208
0:12:32.960 --> 0:12:36.880
and you don't pay for Patreon, then who's paying for that storage?

209
0:12:36.880 --> 0:12:37.880
Just think about that.

210
0:12:37.880 --> 0:12:42.520
Moving onwards for more questions, then FTI to ask if they're fursonic-cute, yeah, that's

211
0:12:42.520 --> 0:12:43.520
a good one.

212
0:12:43.520 --> 0:12:50.000
Next question from Fuzzy Foot asks, Fox, sorry, not Foot, Fuzzy Fox, I'm so sorry.

213
0:12:50.000 --> 0:12:56.080
Fuzzy Fox asks, what is the laggiest component or node you know of?

214
0:12:56.080 --> 0:13:00.320
Go to my public folder, go inside art.

215
0:13:00.320 --> 0:13:04.300
Inside there you'll see a sort of RGB sphere.

216
0:13:04.300 --> 0:13:07.320
That is a piece of artwork I made, hence why it's in the art folder.

217
0:13:07.320 --> 0:13:15.160
It uses an ancient component, a component which I do not recommend using.

218
0:13:15.160 --> 0:13:17.120
It is probably the laggiest one I know of.

219
0:13:17.120 --> 0:13:21.480
You won't notice it if you spawn the artwork in private, like by yourself.

220
0:13:21.480 --> 0:13:26.480
Hence why it's there, but in sessions you'll quickly notice it's causing queued packets.

221
0:13:26.480 --> 0:13:36.060
We have another new question from Scant, who says, can a slot transform be forcefully updated

222
0:13:36.060 --> 0:13:40.360
before the end of a frame, such as raycast, rather?

223
0:13:40.360 --> 0:13:45.200
This is another thing where like Neos wizards and I will disagree.

224
0:13:45.200 --> 0:13:47.320
You shouldn't worry about frames.

225
0:13:47.320 --> 0:13:51.920
If you're worrying about like update cycles, positioning, timing, that's something for

226
0:13:51.920 --> 0:13:54.080
us to fix.

227
0:13:54.080 --> 0:13:55.120
I don't know.

228
0:13:55.120 --> 0:13:59.560
That's again a sort of like rendering thingy or just sort of like an update cycle thing.

229
0:13:59.560 --> 0:14:03.880
If you could maybe ask about your problem or seeing that prompted that question, I might

230
0:14:03.880 --> 0:14:04.880
be able to help.

231
0:14:04.880 --> 0:14:09.440
But like I see people worrying about like, you know, frames, data, things like that.

232
0:14:09.440 --> 0:14:13.200
You shouldn't be too worried about stuff like that.

233
0:14:13.200 --> 0:14:17.440
So scan has updated their question, which says I have switched from using raycast one

234
0:14:17.440 --> 0:14:21.640
to raycast drivers as they have better filtering, however I notice the result is behind by one

235
0:14:21.640 --> 0:14:24.840
frame since it is driving on slot transformations.

236
0:14:24.840 --> 0:14:30.600
I would encourage you to always use the tools which make the like thing you're trying to

237
0:14:30.600 --> 0:14:32.680
build as effective as possible.

238
0:14:32.680 --> 0:14:36.960
Like don't, for example, if someone was reading this and they're seeing what they're reading

239
0:14:36.960 --> 0:14:42.240
from scan and they're like, hey, I want to swap to raycast driver now as well, don't.

240
0:14:42.240 --> 0:14:45.000
If raycast one is helping you, do it.

241
0:14:45.000 --> 0:14:47.740
If raycaster is helping you, do it.

242
0:14:47.740 --> 0:14:52.360
If raycast driver is helping you, do it, and then we'll figure out what's going on there.

243
0:14:52.360 --> 0:14:58.040
As for the actual question, which deals with the result being behind by one frame, I don't

244
0:14:58.040 --> 0:14:59.040
know.

245
0:14:59.040 --> 0:15:01.840
I would have to come into Neos and take a look at your actual problem.

246
0:15:01.840 --> 0:15:03.980
Moving onwards, unfortunately, I wish I could help more.

247
0:15:03.980 --> 0:15:06.940
Maybe I can hop into Neos at some point.

248
0:15:06.940 --> 0:15:10.980
Moving onwards, Fuzzy asks, I always worry about things like loops.

249
0:15:10.980 --> 0:15:14.400
I've had experience where such things lag my computer to death.

250
0:15:14.400 --> 0:15:16.160
Is there any way to do loops?

251
0:15:16.160 --> 0:15:17.160
Yes.

252
0:15:17.160 --> 0:15:18.160
Have bounded loops.

253
0:15:18.160 --> 0:15:22.840
90% of problems people have with loops are where they are unbounded.

254
0:15:22.840 --> 0:15:27.880
Things like the for loop node, people avoid because they don't understand why it causes

255
0:15:27.880 --> 0:15:30.800
problems or why it's causing lag.

256
0:15:30.800 --> 0:15:31.800
For loop's fine.

257
0:15:31.800 --> 0:15:33.840
You just need to use it correctly.

258
0:15:33.840 --> 0:15:37.560
People avoid the while node because they're like, oh, it just lags.

259
0:15:37.560 --> 0:15:39.200
You need a bounded loop.

260
0:15:39.200 --> 0:15:41.480
While is perfectly usable.

261
0:15:41.480 --> 0:15:48.000
Oftentimes loops are being used sort of inefficiently as well or incorrectly.

262
0:15:48.000 --> 0:15:51.880
You need to figure out the solution that you're trying to solve and if it needs a loop.

263
0:15:51.880 --> 0:15:55.080
There are some times where I see people solving problems in Neos and I look at it and I'm

264
0:15:55.080 --> 0:16:00.220
like, do you realize you could do that in half the effort with this node, this component,

265
0:16:00.220 --> 0:16:05.120
or just by changing the not what you're doing, but the outlook of the way that you're doing

266
0:16:05.120 --> 0:16:06.120
it?

267
0:16:06.120 --> 0:16:07.280
I wish I could condense it into words.

268
0:16:07.280 --> 0:16:08.840
It happens all the time.

269
0:16:08.840 --> 0:16:11.440
I know what I mean.

270
0:16:11.440 --> 0:16:14.040
I know how to build things with that mentality.

271
0:16:14.040 --> 0:16:16.040
I just don't know how to explain that mentality.

272
0:16:16.040 --> 0:16:20.120
Again, if you have a specific loop-related problem, I can take a look at it and tell

273
0:16:20.120 --> 0:16:23.200
you how I would do it.

274
0:16:23.200 --> 0:16:27.920
Maybe one day there will be a manifesto from Prime about how to build things.

275
0:16:27.920 --> 0:16:34.960
I have been thinking about doing more videos on just building stuff.

276
0:16:34.960 --> 0:16:38.880
You name it, build a gun, build a door.

277
0:16:38.880 --> 0:16:43.280
I was actually quite interested earlier this week in questions and help.

278
0:16:43.280 --> 0:16:48.760
Someone was asking about a door with a pin code or a type pad and then it would open.

279
0:16:48.760 --> 0:16:49.760
That would be cool.

280
0:16:49.760 --> 0:16:53.720
Again, that would teach you how I think about building things in Neos.

281
0:16:53.720 --> 0:16:56.520
If you have a specific problem, let me know.

282
0:16:56.520 --> 0:17:01.200
So Tony asks, is there anything that can be done to videos on Neos cutting out about half

283
0:17:01.200 --> 0:17:05.740
a second before the actual video is over or is that just a case when VLC gets updated?

284
0:17:05.740 --> 0:17:07.600
Probably when VLC gets updated.

285
0:17:07.600 --> 0:17:09.960
It might also be the video player that you're using.

286
0:17:09.960 --> 0:17:12.140
It also might be a synchronization issue.

287
0:17:12.140 --> 0:17:17.920
So try it in various sizes of sessions, numbers of people, types of video, et cetera.

288
0:17:17.920 --> 0:17:21.920
But the VLC update will be amazing in its ability to stabilize videos.

289
0:17:21.920 --> 0:17:22.920
Tony updates their question.

290
0:17:22.920 --> 0:17:25.680
It seems to happen on any video locally or in a session.

291
0:17:25.680 --> 0:17:27.320
Yeah, VLC update then.

292
0:17:27.320 --> 0:17:28.880
Moving onwards to more questions that have just appeared.

293
0:17:28.880 --> 0:17:31.320
I was blinking and didn't see any and then suddenly two appeared.

294
0:17:31.320 --> 0:17:32.320
Maybe that was my bad.

295
0:17:32.320 --> 0:17:35.360
I might have zoned out for a second, but anyway.

296
0:17:35.360 --> 0:17:38.560
Scan asks, what is the best option for synced timing, the T node?

297
0:17:38.560 --> 0:17:41.520
No, the T node is implicitly not synced.

298
0:17:41.520 --> 0:17:46.160
If you're talking about animation and you want the animation to be 100% synced with

299
0:17:46.160 --> 0:17:50.200
other users, you need to use the tween node or the tween component.

300
0:17:50.200 --> 0:17:52.980
The tween node component is the same thing.

301
0:17:52.980 --> 0:17:54.980
It's a long story.

302
0:17:54.980 --> 0:18:01.320
It operates in a series of writes, which means it's less likely to be unsynced.

303
0:18:01.320 --> 0:18:04.180
It just depends what you need to do.

304
0:18:04.180 --> 0:18:06.180
Synchronization is a problem.

305
0:18:06.180 --> 0:18:12.720
Again, it depends on the problem or the solution.

306
0:18:12.720 --> 0:18:19.420
For example, there was a problem in my run through of abandonware, which is MMC 2021,

307
0:18:19.420 --> 0:18:23.720
where you're in the sewers and you have to rotate like a sewer platform around and we

308
0:18:23.720 --> 0:18:24.720
got out of sync.

309
0:18:24.720 --> 0:18:33.200
So they saw the sewer rotation being one rotation and I saw the other one and we couldn't progress

310
0:18:33.200 --> 0:18:36.760
without one of us dying to like falling in the sewers.

311
0:18:36.760 --> 0:18:41.100
And on reviewing the way that they had built that sewer platform and rotated it, they'd

312
0:18:41.100 --> 0:18:42.560
done it purely with components.

313
0:18:42.560 --> 0:18:46.300
I had a long story conversation with Comdog about this.

314
0:18:46.300 --> 0:18:49.060
If it is critical to your game, don't use components.

315
0:18:49.060 --> 0:18:53.680
Use logics and use writes because it's going to be problems.

316
0:18:53.680 --> 0:18:56.440
Impulses are like an authority check for your game.

317
0:18:56.440 --> 0:18:59.080
They had the same issue with the clock that they had.

318
0:18:59.080 --> 0:19:02.520
You had to reposition the clock hands to a particular time.

319
0:19:02.520 --> 0:19:06.520
They again used components since they had synchronization issues and also floating point

320
0:19:06.520 --> 0:19:08.100
precision issues.

321
0:19:08.100 --> 0:19:13.420
So again, if they had used logics, they would be able to have a point in time sort of clapper

322
0:19:13.420 --> 0:19:17.560
board, if you remember old school film clapper boards, like clap, okay, what's the state

323
0:19:17.560 --> 0:19:18.560
of the clock?

324
0:19:18.560 --> 0:19:19.560
Is it correct?

325
0:19:19.560 --> 0:19:21.080
And that would have resolved that issue.

326
0:19:21.080 --> 0:19:26.360
Use impulses wherever you can to synchronize things up, but it does depend on what you're

327
0:19:26.360 --> 0:19:27.360
doing.

328
0:19:27.360 --> 0:19:29.800
Certainly for things like visual effects or stuff you don't have to interact with, you

329
0:19:29.800 --> 0:19:33.080
should be using T, and it doesn't actually matter if it's slightly out of sync.

330
0:19:33.080 --> 0:19:42.080
A good example here might be wind, stuff floating in the air, particles, rotating clocks, rotating

331
0:19:42.080 --> 0:19:46.160
things like that, all sorts of stuff like that.

332
0:19:46.160 --> 0:19:49.640
For karaoke, I'd recommend you go to, I think it's a Japanese entry, there's an MMC entry

333
0:19:49.640 --> 0:19:55.560
called perfectly synced karaoke that uses the clock error property of the video player

334
0:19:55.560 --> 0:19:57.640
to kind of sync it up between people.

335
0:19:57.640 --> 0:20:03.400
I know in VRChat they do that by exposing sort of like a sync track and then buttons

336
0:20:03.400 --> 0:20:07.720
to each user and asking them to sort of push left or right to sort of try and sync it up

337
0:20:07.720 --> 0:20:08.720
based on the delay.

338
0:20:08.720 --> 0:20:13.800
I don't know how it works, I know it does work, though.

339
0:20:13.800 --> 0:20:14.800
So cool.

340
0:20:14.800 --> 0:20:19.400
I'd have to look, karaoke isn't something I've looked into.

341
0:20:19.400 --> 0:20:25.640
Moving forwards to the next question, Fuzzy asks, why is using write nodes usually considered

342
0:20:25.640 --> 0:20:26.640
a bad idea?

343
0:20:26.640 --> 0:20:27.640
It isn't.

344
0:20:27.640 --> 0:20:29.880
If anyone's telling you write nodes are bad, they need to go away.

345
0:20:29.880 --> 0:20:35.480
Again, you need to use the appropriate mechanism for whatever you're trying to do.

346
0:20:35.480 --> 0:20:39.800
Write nodes are fantastic if you need to synchronize a value across the network.

347
0:20:39.800 --> 0:20:42.400
That's what write nodes are for.

348
0:20:42.400 --> 0:20:47.800
When you are moving your hands around, you are not technically, but essentially you're

349
0:20:47.800 --> 0:20:52.280
performing a write every millisecond updating, oh, my left hand is over here in relation

350
0:20:52.280 --> 0:20:55.940
to my fingers and my right hand is over here and my head is positioned this way and my

351
0:20:55.940 --> 0:20:58.480
voice is at this level.

352
0:20:58.480 --> 0:21:03.600
Those use streams, which aren't really writes, but they are still writes in that they are

353
0:21:03.600 --> 0:21:07.480
causing network traffic, and that's what a write does, it causes network traffic.

354
0:21:07.480 --> 0:21:11.720
So if you need that value to be synchronized across the network, use writes.

355
0:21:11.720 --> 0:21:16.280
One of the areas where I would consider them a bad idea is actually the opposite answer

356
0:21:16.280 --> 0:21:19.480
to the question that Scan had about synchronization.

357
0:21:19.480 --> 0:21:22.040
If you don't need something to synchronize, don't use writes.

358
0:21:22.040 --> 0:21:27.720
A good example here, it comes up just because my brain's in this area right now, is imagine

359
0:21:27.720 --> 0:21:29.880
you have a model solar system.

360
0:21:29.880 --> 0:21:33.720
So it's sitting on someone's desk in a wizard tower and it's a model solar system.

361
0:21:33.720 --> 0:21:37.800
So it's got, you know, the little metal things, auroraries, I really think they're called,

362
0:21:37.800 --> 0:21:45.960
like I don't know how to spell it, that aurorary, and it's got the planets rotating around it.

363
0:21:45.960 --> 0:21:50.000
You could write sync that, at which point all of those planets in that model would be

364
0:21:50.000 --> 0:21:55.720
in the same position, but they don't need to be, so just use T or use the spinner component.

365
0:21:55.720 --> 0:22:00.140
It doesn't matter that they're out of sync, it's a visual element in the wizard's tower.

366
0:22:00.140 --> 0:22:04.840
You might want to synchronize instead the animation of the wizard attacking you or the

367
0:22:04.840 --> 0:22:08.620
animation of a particular puzzle-related element interacting with it.

368
0:22:08.620 --> 0:22:13.400
But if it's just background noise, background objects, T. Another example there would be

369
0:22:13.400 --> 0:22:16.360
flickering lights at a tutorial on that one recently.

370
0:22:16.360 --> 0:22:21.820
It doesn't matter if the lights are flickering out of order, if you need it synchronized

371
0:22:21.820 --> 0:22:26.800
use writes, if you don't, use T. Another question from Scant who says, is there a write that

372
0:22:26.800 --> 0:22:30.920
isn't network synced, like needing to do many dynamic operations and only one of the last

373
0:22:30.920 --> 0:22:33.200
writes are important?

374
0:22:33.200 --> 0:22:36.800
That's complicated because that depends on the setup again.

375
0:22:36.800 --> 0:22:41.140
What you need to remember is that when an impulse, any time you see a white ribbon,

376
0:22:41.140 --> 0:22:44.080
that is locally calculated and then the results are propagated.

377
0:22:44.080 --> 0:22:48.720
As an example there, let's say you had a button and then when you pushed it, it set your position

378
0:22:48.720 --> 0:22:53.880
to be 10 units above where you are, so it's basically like a short range teleport upwards.

379
0:22:53.880 --> 0:22:57.680
It could do maths in the middle there, but then at the end, it will do a set position

380
0:22:57.680 --> 0:22:58.940
or use that set position node.

381
0:22:58.940 --> 0:23:02.920
That set position node is effectively a write, and what that's doing is it's populating new

382
0:23:02.920 --> 0:23:04.560
data to the data model.

383
0:23:04.560 --> 0:23:09.600
It's saying, hey, prime, scan, fuzzy, you are now 10 units above where you are, that's

384
0:23:09.600 --> 0:23:10.600
a write.

385
0:23:10.600 --> 0:23:14.240
So there is network synced, but the stuff in the middle, let's say it does a calculation

386
0:23:14.240 --> 0:23:21.520
like, I don't know, the stars and their position in the world causes how far you get sent up.

387
0:23:21.520 --> 0:23:24.520
That calculation doesn't need to be network synchronized.

388
0:23:24.520 --> 0:23:27.200
Again, it really does depend on the setup.

389
0:23:27.200 --> 0:23:29.440
That also goes back to the updating relays, right?

390
0:23:29.440 --> 0:23:33.280
The updating relays aren't needed when you're in the middle of like an impulse-based operation,

391
0:23:33.280 --> 0:23:37.640
but it's really difficult to understand when they are and aren't needed, so just like try

392
0:23:37.640 --> 0:23:40.760
it with and then remove it and see if it breaks.

393
0:23:40.760 --> 0:23:46.800
Moving forwards, I guess, like ask more questions if you need more support there.

394
0:23:46.800 --> 0:23:50.120
Fuzzy says, so that's why some people complain about writes because it causes updates.

395
0:23:50.120 --> 0:23:52.200
Yeah, they should stop complaining.

396
0:23:52.200 --> 0:23:56.120
If they've got dynamic bones, dynamic bones cause updates, right?

397
0:23:56.120 --> 0:24:00.120
You know, like dynamic bones, moving your hand, grabbing something causes updates, complain

398
0:24:00.120 --> 0:24:01.120
about that more.

399
0:24:01.120 --> 0:24:04.300
If you need to use writes, go for it.

400
0:24:04.300 --> 0:24:05.300
Sometimes you don't know.

401
0:24:05.300 --> 0:24:07.640
I do see people using like update a lot.

402
0:24:07.640 --> 0:24:11.640
That's again usually occurring on animations that are sorry, I don't know how to pronounce

403
0:24:11.640 --> 0:24:13.160
that word, or the flickering light.

404
0:24:13.160 --> 0:24:14.160
That's the usual case.

405
0:24:14.160 --> 0:24:17.800
They're like writing the flickering light on and off, which is like a network update

406
0:24:17.800 --> 0:24:19.740
every single like frame.

407
0:24:19.740 --> 0:24:20.740
Don't do that.

408
0:24:20.740 --> 0:24:23.640
Use T. At that point, yeah, you can be mad about the writes, but again, it's really kind

409
0:24:23.640 --> 0:24:24.640
of like subtle.

410
0:24:24.640 --> 0:24:30.040
Moving onwards to bad halo ninja, it's best to hear from you, bad halo ninja, I used to

411
0:24:30.040 --> 0:24:31.040
see all the time.

412
0:24:31.040 --> 0:24:33.760
I'm sure you're working on some cool stuff.

413
0:24:33.760 --> 0:24:35.600
This is a bit of a back end question.

414
0:24:35.600 --> 0:24:37.600
Is last modifying user for sync values broken?

415
0:24:37.600 --> 0:24:40.720
I've noticed that in the logs it tries to log it sometimes, but it never has a value.

416
0:24:40.720 --> 0:24:43.160
I've also tried using it sometimes in my mods and it's always null.

417
0:24:43.160 --> 0:24:44.160
I wouldn't know.

418
0:24:44.160 --> 0:24:46.160
I'd have to look into the actual code for that.

419
0:24:46.160 --> 0:24:50.600
As it's a mod, it's implicitly not supported, so I can't answer that open code base basically.

420
0:24:50.600 --> 0:24:54.960
I know that's like a frustrating answer, but that's unfortunately all I have for you on

421
0:24:54.960 --> 0:24:55.960
that one.

422
0:24:55.960 --> 0:24:56.960
I believe that's all the time we have for questions.

423
0:24:56.960 --> 0:24:59.520
Farsi, if you have a question, go for it and type it, because you were typing it whilst

424
0:24:59.520 --> 0:25:00.520
I was closing off.

425
0:25:00.520 --> 0:25:01.520
So if you still have a question, go for it.

426
0:25:01.520 --> 0:25:02.520
Otherwise, we'll be closing off.

427
0:25:02.520 --> 0:25:06.480
This will be posted on Samba shortly with the silence removed.

428
0:25:06.480 --> 0:25:09.920
And if you have any questions or you want any follow-ups on any questions you've asked,

429
0:25:09.920 --> 0:25:14.720
please go ahead and direct message me anytime and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

430
0:25:14.720 --> 0:25:16.680
Let's just wait for Farsi to stop typing.

431
0:25:16.680 --> 0:25:17.680
No pressure, Farsi.

432
0:25:17.680 --> 0:25:22.520
Okay, so Farsi's last question is, can mods do things for other users without them?

433
0:25:22.520 --> 0:25:27.040
Do you mean moderators or Neos mods?

434
0:25:27.040 --> 0:25:28.040
Modding.

435
0:25:28.040 --> 0:25:29.040
Yes.

436
0:25:29.040 --> 0:25:33.440
In fact, lots of the mods that we see are stuff that we want to add to Neos.

437
0:25:33.440 --> 0:25:39.020
I understand why they're added as mods, but a lot of them are basically just like, yo,

438
0:25:39.020 --> 0:25:41.800
it's a feature that we want to add, but we just haven't had time to.

439
0:25:41.800 --> 0:25:46.200
And a lot of that then falls into the sort of umbrella term of shortcuts.

440
0:25:46.200 --> 0:25:50.760
I noticed yesterday actually there was a mod which added a button to the static audio clip

441
0:25:50.760 --> 0:25:51.760
which reverses it.

442
0:25:51.760 --> 0:25:54.420
So you can do reversing audio very easily.

443
0:25:54.420 --> 0:25:55.960
Great mod that adds that button.

444
0:25:55.960 --> 0:25:58.800
I love that someone did that and found it useful.

445
0:25:58.800 --> 0:26:03.000
I could probably add that quite quickly to Neos's actual source code if we weren't in

446
0:26:03.000 --> 0:26:04.740
our current set of circumstances.

447
0:26:04.740 --> 0:26:08.120
So I might add that eventually.

448
0:26:08.120 --> 0:26:09.560
So it's a good example.

449
0:26:09.560 --> 0:26:10.560
Keep doing it.

450
0:26:10.560 --> 0:26:11.560
Don't feel bad about it.

451
0:26:11.560 --> 0:26:13.440
Do you read the modding policy?

452
0:26:13.440 --> 0:26:15.900
Do you read the security reporting policy as well?

453
0:26:15.900 --> 0:26:20.000
But yes, most mods are shortcuts, really.

454
0:26:20.000 --> 0:26:21.000
I believe we're done.

455
0:26:21.000 --> 0:26:23.920
If there are any further questions, feel free to direct message me.

456
0:26:23.920 --> 0:26:25.800
Otherwise I'm going to leave off here.

457
0:26:25.800 --> 0:26:28.800
And I'll speak to you again soon.
