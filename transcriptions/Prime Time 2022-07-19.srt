1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.280
the weekly AMA for questions about Neos with me, Frank.

2
0:00:04.280 --> 0:00:07.160
If you have any questions, please drop them into the officer's texture.

3
0:00:07.160 --> 0:00:08.680
That's two above the one that we're currently on,

4
0:00:08.680 --> 0:00:10.800
and we'll get started in the order that they appear.

5
0:00:10.800 --> 0:00:13.040
Looking at the current question list,

6
0:00:13.040 --> 0:00:14.960
we only have one which is unfortunately about cheese.

7
0:00:14.960 --> 0:00:18.240
I don't answer cheese questions, I'm sorry.

8
0:00:18.240 --> 0:00:22.960
So we now have an actual Neos question from Zagre who says,

9
0:00:22.960 --> 0:00:25.800
do you know a way to dynamically flip checkboxes in the dash?

10
0:00:25.800 --> 0:00:28.760
I wanted to make it so I automatically flip the head movement,

11
0:00:28.760 --> 0:00:33.320
stroke controller movement in the dash when I switch from fly to walk.

12
0:00:33.320 --> 0:00:36.640
Yeah, so you will need to inspect the dash.

13
0:00:36.640 --> 0:00:37.880
There's various ways to do that,

14
0:00:37.880 --> 0:00:40.680
like just inspect user space, you'll find the dash.

15
0:00:40.680 --> 0:00:43.280
Inside there, you'll find that there are

16
0:00:43.280 --> 0:00:46.920
a bunch of components near those checkboxes called setting sync.

17
0:00:46.920 --> 0:00:51.200
Now, you can use setting sync in user space and in user space only

18
0:00:51.200 --> 0:00:57.240
to synchronize and update various settings.

19
0:00:57.240 --> 0:00:59.280
So the way you'd have to link that into

20
0:00:59.280 --> 0:01:02.480
world space is some form of like cloud variable probably,

21
0:01:02.480 --> 0:01:05.440
which would detect which one that you're in.

22
0:01:05.440 --> 0:01:07.840
As cloud variables are sometimes slow,

23
0:01:07.840 --> 0:01:10.320
I'm not really sure it's ideal.

24
0:01:10.320 --> 0:01:12.280
It might be good though to make

25
0:01:12.280 --> 0:01:16.400
like a shortcut option that can just be on the dash.

26
0:01:16.400 --> 0:01:17.720
I'm not sure I released it.

27
0:01:17.720 --> 0:01:21.400
If I did, it's inside my public folder under facets.

28
0:01:21.400 --> 0:01:24.480
I have a quick shortcut checkbox that can go

29
0:01:24.480 --> 0:01:29.080
between Neos's wobbly lasers and my preferred lasers,

30
0:01:29.080 --> 0:01:32.080
which are 100 percent straight with no wobbling.

31
0:01:32.080 --> 0:01:34.080
That was a lot of detail,

32
0:01:34.080 --> 0:01:36.480
like I kept forgetting the numbers and having to write them

33
0:01:36.480 --> 0:01:39.640
down or look up a pin message or whatever.

34
0:01:39.640 --> 0:01:43.760
So I made that facet and that just uses setting sync and

35
0:01:43.760 --> 0:01:48.360
data presets to update some setting sync components to

36
0:01:48.360 --> 0:01:52.600
the non-wobbly or wobbly things when I push that checkbox.

37
0:01:52.600 --> 0:01:56.000
Really helpful. I don't really turn that checkbox off.

38
0:01:56.000 --> 0:01:58.600
I mean, I made it and it's now on my dash forever.

39
0:01:58.600 --> 0:01:59.960
So it's cool.

40
0:01:59.960 --> 0:02:01.400
I made it, take a look at it.

41
0:02:01.400 --> 0:02:05.960
Ozi asks, what's a technical Neosmith you see commonly around?

42
0:02:05.960 --> 0:02:08.040
So I actually made something for

43
0:02:08.040 --> 0:02:11.000
Giberl yesterday and I'm going to share it in this chat.

44
0:02:11.000 --> 0:02:12.760
I'm just going to go find it.

45
0:02:12.760 --> 0:02:15.720
You can actually, so just jumping around whilst I go find

46
0:02:15.720 --> 0:02:18.360
this particular thing I made on my Giberl.

47
0:02:18.360 --> 0:02:23.040
Zag says that they wish they had logics in user space.

48
0:02:23.040 --> 0:02:27.320
You can. You just need to create the logic inside

49
0:02:27.320 --> 0:02:29.520
world space on the facet and then install

50
0:02:29.520 --> 0:02:32.280
that facet onto your user space.

51
0:02:32.280 --> 0:02:33.760
I do it frequently.

52
0:02:33.760 --> 0:02:36.600
When you're writing facets in that manner,

53
0:02:36.600 --> 0:02:40.480
you just need to imagine that it's going to work and then test it,

54
0:02:40.480 --> 0:02:41.600
because of course you can't test it.

55
0:02:41.600 --> 0:02:44.520
Lots of user space stuff just won't work outside of user space.

56
0:02:44.520 --> 0:02:47.600
So here's the note which I gave to Giberl,

57
0:02:47.600 --> 0:02:52.320
because Giberl's having trouble basically making an avatar that did something.

58
0:02:52.320 --> 0:02:54.160
And I'm like, why?

59
0:02:54.160 --> 0:02:56.120
And they were trying to avoid like logics,

60
0:02:56.120 --> 0:02:59.480
colliders, slots, and everything to try and make this system.

61
0:02:59.480 --> 0:03:01.080
And I'm like, this is ridiculous.

62
0:03:01.080 --> 0:03:03.680
You should use whatever the hell you want to use.

63
0:03:03.680 --> 0:03:05.120
Slots are a problem,

64
0:03:05.120 --> 0:03:11.040
but it's not one that you should make humongous efforts to try and stop.

65
0:03:11.040 --> 0:03:12.560
You shouldn't be going like, oh,

66
0:03:12.560 --> 0:03:15.280
I'm going to collapse all nodes into the same slot,

67
0:03:15.280 --> 0:03:17.720
or I'm going to avoid using relays because they have a slot.

68
0:03:17.720 --> 0:03:20.040
It's something that you should think about from a different attitude,

69
0:03:20.040 --> 0:03:23.520
which is, do I need this functionality on my avatar?

70
0:03:23.520 --> 0:03:26.000
If the answer is yes, then sure, add the slots for it.

71
0:03:26.000 --> 0:03:28.160
If the answer is no, then don't add slots for it.

72
0:03:28.160 --> 0:03:30.600
For example, I don't care what weather it is where you exist.

73
0:03:30.600 --> 0:03:32.840
I don't care what your FPS is.

74
0:03:32.840 --> 0:03:34.680
I don't care what your queue packets is.

75
0:03:34.680 --> 0:03:38.360
I don't care what your last ate for dinner.

76
0:03:38.360 --> 0:03:39.960
Like don't put that stuff on your name badge.

77
0:03:39.960 --> 0:03:42.360
That is not needed functionality.

78
0:03:42.360 --> 0:03:45.080
Do you need a gun which has a hundred slots on it on your avatar?

79
0:03:45.080 --> 0:03:46.600
How many times do you shoot that?

80
0:03:46.600 --> 0:03:48.040
Do you need your multi-tool on your avatar?

81
0:03:48.040 --> 0:03:51.240
How many times do you use that when you first launch into a session, et cetera?

82
0:03:51.240 --> 0:03:55.040
Things like that. Think about functionality over form.

83
0:03:55.040 --> 0:03:57.880
It's like a video game character that says that function of form.

84
0:03:57.880 --> 0:04:00.440
I can't remember what the hell video game character is.

85
0:04:00.440 --> 0:04:03.080
It's probably a champion from League of Legends, though.

86
0:04:03.080 --> 0:04:06.520
Anyway, and then they were like, oh, yeah, we had colliders or birds.

87
0:04:06.520 --> 0:04:08.680
We didn't know the colliders are not bad.

88
0:04:08.680 --> 0:04:10.760
You just need to know how to use them correctly.

89
0:04:10.760 --> 0:04:14.240
And then they heard, you know, logic is bad because everyone talking about logics is

90
0:04:14.240 --> 0:04:16.160
like 100 percent fine to use.

91
0:04:16.160 --> 0:04:18.640
And if anyone is telling you any of these things,

92
0:04:18.640 --> 0:04:21.120
then you need to redirect them over to the Wikismith page

93
0:04:21.920 --> 0:04:25.360
or to the things to avoid page, because like it's getting ridiculous, right?

94
0:04:25.680 --> 0:04:29.520
Use the tools that are available to you and they'll work.

95
0:04:29.520 --> 0:04:32.480
And then keep in mind function over form.

96
0:04:32.480 --> 0:04:35.280
And, you know, you'll you'll get stuff done.

97
0:04:35.280 --> 0:04:36.880
You'll get stuff working.

98
0:04:36.880 --> 0:04:41.240
The problems I see with most avatars can be sort of broken down into too much on them.

99
0:04:41.600 --> 0:04:42.760
You don't need all the systems.

100
0:04:42.760 --> 0:04:44.320
If you don't use them, don't install them.

101
0:04:46.000 --> 0:04:47.120
Non-baked blend shapes.

102
0:04:47.120 --> 0:04:48.720
Please bake blend shapes.

103
0:04:48.720 --> 0:04:51.520
If you don't want to bake blend shapes, then sorry.

104
0:04:51.520 --> 0:04:53.000
You kind of need to these days.

105
0:04:53.000 --> 0:04:56.240
So take a look and that as well.

106
0:04:57.160 --> 0:04:59.800
Moving forwards to the next question.

107
0:04:59.800 --> 0:05:03.920
Duff asks, do you think the recent rule changes in regards to body mesh exposure

108
0:05:03.920 --> 0:05:06.640
adhering to European standards is going to be beneficial for platform long term?

109
0:05:07.160 --> 0:05:09.760
Yes. So let me let me tell you how it works.

110
0:05:09.760 --> 0:05:13.120
So the the opinion on on

111
0:05:14.160 --> 0:05:17.320
what we're essentially going over here is I heard a time a while ago

112
0:05:17.320 --> 0:05:21.160
and it sounds strange, but like it is the easy way to talk about it.

113
0:05:21.400 --> 0:05:26.720
The term being topless equality is what basically that rule changes about.

114
0:05:26.720 --> 0:05:30.000
And the reason topless quality has not been a thing

115
0:05:31.240 --> 0:05:32.920
was largely because of society.

116
0:05:32.920 --> 0:05:36.800
And now in content creation, as in sort of Twitch, YouTube,

117
0:05:36.800 --> 0:05:40.160
TikTok, whatever you want to like, whichever site you're talking about is

118
0:05:40.160 --> 0:05:42.840
largely a problem to do with advertisers.

119
0:05:42.840 --> 0:05:45.480
So most platforms are in charge of what they do,

120
0:05:45.840 --> 0:05:49.240
but they're not really in charge of like how they make money.

121
0:05:49.240 --> 0:05:51.240
Most of them make money via ads.

122
0:05:51.240 --> 0:05:54.960
And so the way the ads work is an ad provider company

123
0:05:54.960 --> 0:05:57.640
that usually sort of farms ads out to other people.

124
0:05:58.600 --> 0:06:02.240
You can think of it like a sort of record label or, you know, a publisher

125
0:06:02.240 --> 0:06:04.920
or something like that for ads

126
0:06:04.920 --> 0:06:08.120
will sort of say to a site, hey, we want to, you know,

127
0:06:08.120 --> 0:06:11.320
ship this car insurance ad on this type of channel

128
0:06:12.080 --> 0:06:16.680
targeting this demographic, you know, this gender, this age range, et cetera.

129
0:06:17.000 --> 0:06:21.600
And we don't want to target this advert on anything controversial.

130
0:06:21.880 --> 0:06:26.240
So it would remove adverts and monetization from conversations

131
0:06:26.240 --> 0:06:30.520
about sexuality, identity, conversations about politics, religion, et cetera.

132
0:06:30.520 --> 0:06:33.240
Often don't get as many ad placements as other things.

133
0:06:33.240 --> 0:06:36.240
And so then adding to that, you end up with a sort of perception thing

134
0:06:36.240 --> 0:06:38.960
where these ad providers are like, hey, we don't want our content

135
0:06:38.960 --> 0:06:42.240
appearing on anything even remotely adult because we don't want our brand

136
0:06:42.240 --> 0:06:43.960
lined up with that.

137
0:06:43.960 --> 0:06:46.360
And so then that leads to, well, hey,

138
0:06:47.280 --> 0:06:50.200
if we're going to lose money by having this content on our platform,

139
0:06:50.200 --> 0:06:53.720
then then maybe we should, you know, just ban toplessness.

140
0:06:54.600 --> 0:06:58.000
And then that leads into a big thing where it's like, OK, well,

141
0:06:58.000 --> 0:07:01.320
is it cultural or is it purely ad related?

142
0:07:01.320 --> 0:07:03.000
A lot of the times it's purely ad related.

143
0:07:03.000 --> 0:07:04.120
Sometimes it's not.

144
0:07:04.120 --> 0:07:05.960
Depends on the platform.

145
0:07:05.960 --> 0:07:08.040
And then that leads into sort of other things.

146
0:07:08.760 --> 0:07:11.320
Moderation being the other one is like, how do you moderate this content?

147
0:07:12.520 --> 0:07:14.960
Quite easy to do, I think.

148
0:07:14.960 --> 0:07:18.320
If it's sexual in nature, then clearly it breaks guidelines.

149
0:07:18.320 --> 0:07:22.120
If it's non-sexual in nature, then maybe what's the problem?

150
0:07:22.120 --> 0:07:23.480
Like, I don't understand.

151
0:07:23.480 --> 0:07:27.800
There are interesting sort of things I see where we're moving towards a way

152
0:07:27.800 --> 0:07:30.840
where, hey, maybe this can start being resolved.

153
0:07:30.840 --> 0:07:33.880
And I'm not saying you're going to see topless equality on all platforms.

154
0:07:33.880 --> 0:07:37.640
I'm saying it's like there are steps I see which are taking towards

155
0:07:37.640 --> 0:07:40.800
sort of the platform being more responsible for that.

156
0:07:40.800 --> 0:07:43.280
I see better tooling, better reporting coming out.

157
0:07:43.280 --> 0:07:45.440
I mean, every platform, you know, always has the problem.

158
0:07:45.440 --> 0:07:46.800
It's like we have too much bad content.

159
0:07:46.800 --> 0:07:48.840
We don't know what to do with it, et cetera, stuff like that.

160
0:07:49.560 --> 0:07:51.680
Advancements like COPPA, that

161
0:07:52.600 --> 0:07:54.480
annoying thing you have to do every time you upload a video

162
0:07:54.480 --> 0:07:56.080
and then she said it as an automatic.

163
0:07:56.080 --> 0:07:58.040
That is the lawmakers trying to fix it.

164
0:07:58.240 --> 0:08:00.320
YouTube Kids is YouTube trying to fix it.

165
0:08:00.320 --> 0:08:01.720
But YouTube Kids is a weird space.

166
0:08:01.720 --> 0:08:04.680
So like we've got people trying to fix it.

167
0:08:04.840 --> 0:08:05.960
I don't know.

168
0:08:06.360 --> 0:08:10.800
I see it as like another weird holdover from sort of archaic practices.

169
0:08:10.800 --> 0:08:13.000
It's like it's strange.

170
0:08:13.520 --> 0:08:16.120
Having said that, though, there is like a

171
0:08:16.120 --> 0:08:18.880
difficult like way to talk about it.

172
0:08:18.880 --> 0:08:21.080
It's like, when is the borderline?

173
0:08:21.080 --> 0:08:23.640
When is the line? When is over the line? Right.

174
0:08:24.320 --> 0:08:28.120
If you are like concerned about it or upset or,

175
0:08:28.120 --> 0:08:31.880
you know, thinking about it, a good way to look at it

176
0:08:31.880 --> 0:08:36.680
is to compare it to breastfeeding in public places, which is another huge issue.

177
0:08:36.680 --> 0:08:39.080
It's like, what's going on here?

178
0:08:39.440 --> 0:08:42.480
Now, like I've seen it multiple times and I think it's cool.

179
0:08:42.480 --> 0:08:47.080
But like, you know, the mother always looks ashamed or scared

180
0:08:47.080 --> 0:08:50.360
or, you know, anxious when I see it.

181
0:08:50.680 --> 0:08:54.200
You know, it once was like sort of in a park and I'm like,

182
0:08:54.320 --> 0:08:55.360
oh, I know what's going on there.

183
0:08:55.360 --> 0:08:57.360
And I'm just like, cool. And I moved on with my dad.

184
0:08:57.360 --> 0:08:59.120
I didn't need to be like, oh, that's disgusting.

185
0:08:59.120 --> 0:09:01.280
This baby's sucking a nipple like it.

186
0:09:01.280 --> 0:09:03.440
It's it's not a problem.

187
0:09:03.440 --> 0:09:05.200
And thinking about that

188
0:09:05.200 --> 0:09:08.320
when compared to everything else might sort of help you out there.

189
0:09:09.640 --> 0:09:12.520
Having said that, though, I do work for a lot of platforms

190
0:09:12.520 --> 0:09:16.960
where those platforms have rules and guidelines that are beyond my control.

191
0:09:16.960 --> 0:09:20.160
So the moderation team largely run the policies of moderation.

192
0:09:20.640 --> 0:09:22.880
And I largely don't have a say in what they do.

193
0:09:22.880 --> 0:09:25.200
And the reason behind that is like I'm not in that area.

194
0:09:25.200 --> 0:09:27.600
Now, some people will say like, hey, Neos is small.

195
0:09:27.600 --> 0:09:28.640
Why can't you be in the area?

196
0:09:28.640 --> 0:09:30.600
And the answer is, I totally could.

197
0:09:30.600 --> 0:09:33.760
But the moderation team are quite full and I trust them.

198
0:09:33.760 --> 0:09:35.760
And so I defer to their policies.

199
0:09:35.760 --> 0:09:37.880
When I work for larger companies, I'm like,

200
0:09:38.280 --> 0:09:42.400
these people have teams of people that are designed to make these policies.

201
0:09:42.400 --> 0:09:44.880
Teams of lawyers are designed to make these policies.

202
0:09:45.160 --> 0:09:49.080
Teams of the other side of ads, which is the sort of company side of ads

203
0:09:49.080 --> 0:09:52.800
that will talk to the ad brokers that are trying to make these policies.

204
0:09:52.800 --> 0:09:56.200
I don't have the time, energy or attention

205
0:09:56.200 --> 0:09:58.280
to do it correctly or to challenge that.

206
0:09:58.600 --> 0:10:00.360
And so I kind of defer to them.

207
0:10:00.360 --> 0:10:02.320
Of course, I always give them feedback.

208
0:10:02.320 --> 0:10:04.800
But as an employee of those companies,

209
0:10:04.800 --> 0:10:07.560
I need to align with whatever those their policies are.

210
0:10:07.560 --> 0:10:10.320
Otherwise, I'm breaking their policies, which is incorrect.

211
0:10:10.520 --> 0:10:13.040
Another good way to think about that is how your relationship

212
0:10:13.040 --> 0:10:15.680
with a security team, if you work any sort of technical place,

213
0:10:16.200 --> 0:10:18.400
if the security team says like, hey,

214
0:10:19.080 --> 0:10:21.960
there's a security issue in your product, your service,

215
0:10:21.960 --> 0:10:25.680
your building, your environment, you listen to them and you fix it

216
0:10:26.040 --> 0:10:28.120
because it's security's job to do that.

217
0:10:28.120 --> 0:10:30.400
And you kind of just have to trust that they are better.

218
0:10:30.720 --> 0:10:32.920
If you didn't like any of that,

219
0:10:32.920 --> 0:10:35.600
then I'm going to highlight one sentence from that.

220
0:10:35.920 --> 0:10:39.560
I think there should be equality here, full stop, because like,

221
0:10:39.880 --> 0:10:40.680
that's all that there.

222
0:10:40.680 --> 0:10:42.760
If you don't think that there should be equality here,

223
0:10:42.760 --> 0:10:45.880
then consider what you wear in public the next time you're out

224
0:10:45.880 --> 0:10:49.040
swimming or at the beach if you are male presenting.

225
0:10:49.040 --> 0:10:51.920
Moving onwards, Duff is asking follow up questions.

226
0:10:51.920 --> 0:10:54.440
This is going to be a fun office hours.

227
0:10:54.440 --> 0:10:56.280
Duff asks, do you think that the recent

228
0:10:56.280 --> 0:10:57.760
I don't know that that's the previous one.

229
0:10:57.760 --> 0:10:59.960
It was the next question scanning around.

230
0:10:59.960 --> 0:11:01.000
Duff says, in your opinion,

231
0:11:01.000 --> 0:11:03.000
what is the fine line between certain personal roles in worlds

232
0:11:03.000 --> 0:11:06.320
that one user controls that make conflict with guides and guidelines?

233
0:11:06.320 --> 0:11:08.280
However, it's in their own private world.

234
0:11:08.280 --> 0:11:11.960
If it's in private world, like most of the Neos guidelines,

235
0:11:11.960 --> 0:11:13.200
not all of the Neos guidelines,

236
0:11:13.200 --> 0:11:16.400
read the Neos guidelines from information get stripped back a little bit.

237
0:11:16.400 --> 0:11:20.560
So like you, you can do adult content provided you have consent

238
0:11:20.560 --> 0:11:21.880
with everyone in the room.

239
0:11:21.880 --> 0:11:24.600
I am tired of being

240
0:11:24.600 --> 0:11:29.640
teleported into a damp, dark place from across the map.

241
0:11:29.640 --> 0:11:31.400
Please stop doing that.

242
0:11:31.400 --> 0:11:35.200
I will fix your logic if you want me to, but like, stop it.

243
0:11:36.200 --> 0:11:40.640
Stop teleporting me to dark places from across the map, please.

244
0:11:40.640 --> 0:11:42.520
It happens too much.

245
0:11:42.520 --> 0:11:43.800
You know what I'm talking about?

246
0:11:43.800 --> 0:11:44.240
Great.

247
0:11:44.240 --> 0:11:48.280
If you don't want to, if you don't know what I'm talking about, also great.

248
0:11:49.920 --> 0:11:54.120
So, yeah, most of the Neos guidelines get sort of stripped back a little bit or adjusted.

249
0:11:54.640 --> 0:11:58.920
And so that allows you to be different to the guidelines

250
0:11:58.920 --> 0:12:03.640
in those areas that kind of like change and get like altered.

251
0:12:04.520 --> 0:12:07.160
There is a line still there, though, where it's like, hey,

252
0:12:07.160 --> 0:12:10.520
these things are still against the guidelines, at which point it's like, hey,

253
0:12:10.840 --> 0:12:12.720
it's still against the guidelines.

254
0:12:12.720 --> 0:12:15.960
So I do understand that there is like a line that that might be up against,

255
0:12:16.400 --> 0:12:19.720
particularly in private sessions, but provided it meets those guidelines

256
0:12:19.720 --> 0:12:24.480
with the private world stipulations sort of thrown in, then great.

257
0:12:25.040 --> 0:12:29.280
Yeah, Zach, the guideline changes is in devlog.

258
0:12:29.560 --> 0:12:33.160
So I have a request for anyone who has missed the policy.

259
0:12:33.160 --> 0:12:34.720
I know there's a lot of people who missed that.

260
0:12:34.720 --> 0:12:38.320
Please ensure that you have Discord notifications turned on for devlog,

261
0:12:38.640 --> 0:12:40.840
Neos updates and announcements.

262
0:12:40.840 --> 0:12:42.240
You don't have to read everything in there,

263
0:12:42.240 --> 0:12:43.960
but those are the most important channels.

264
0:12:43.960 --> 0:12:46.280
We promise we won't spam those that much.

265
0:12:46.280 --> 0:12:48.840
They're just stuff that might be important to know.

266
0:12:49.440 --> 0:12:53.640
If you miss them and you have notifications turned off on those channels,

267
0:12:54.640 --> 0:12:59.000
then partially, and I don't mean fully because we can always do more to notify

268
0:12:59.000 --> 0:13:02.840
you, partially could be seen as your fault for missing them.

269
0:13:03.160 --> 0:13:06.080
In the future, I hope that we have big updates.

270
0:13:06.080 --> 0:13:10.480
We can like put something in the dash that sort of says, yo, hello.

271
0:13:10.480 --> 0:13:13.720
You know, when you like load certain products,

272
0:13:13.720 --> 0:13:15.960
there's always like the message of the day.

273
0:13:15.960 --> 0:13:18.160
So the reason why you're seeing like a rise of launchers,

274
0:13:18.160 --> 0:13:20.000
it's so like they can upsell other services.

275
0:13:20.000 --> 0:13:21.600
You know, there's like the Minecraft launcher.

276
0:13:21.600 --> 0:13:23.080
Like, why do I need to launch Minecraft?

277
0:13:23.080 --> 0:13:25.720
I used to just run Minecraft.exe or whatever it was,

278
0:13:25.720 --> 0:13:27.040
and then like Minecraft loaded up.

279
0:13:27.040 --> 0:13:28.520
And now there's a Minecraft launcher.

280
0:13:28.520 --> 0:13:29.800
It's so they can say like,

281
0:13:29.800 --> 0:13:31.520
Yo guys, here comes the next update.

282
0:13:31.520 --> 0:13:33.760
There's a change to our rules, stuff like that.

283
0:13:34.000 --> 0:13:37.920
We can cram a lot of that into the dash and provide sort of messages to you.

284
0:13:37.920 --> 0:13:40.560
The usual way of doing it is providing basically like,

285
0:13:40.560 --> 0:13:42.640
has the user send this message? No.

286
0:13:42.640 --> 0:13:43.920
OK, display it to them.

287
0:13:43.920 --> 0:13:46.200
Has the user send this message and push the OK button?

288
0:13:46.200 --> 0:13:48.480
OK, never display it to them again.

289
0:13:48.480 --> 0:13:50.240
And then when they're like, I missed the message, it's like,

290
0:13:50.240 --> 0:13:53.120
hey, we showed the message to people.

291
0:13:54.080 --> 0:13:55.880
I'd love to get more open data about that as well.

292
0:13:55.880 --> 0:13:57.520
Like, for example, if we kept getting feedback

293
0:13:57.520 --> 0:14:00.160
that lots of people missed the

294
0:14:01.200 --> 0:14:03.760
missed the announcement, then we can look at the data.

295
0:14:03.760 --> 0:14:08.360
And we wouldn't zone anyone out or specifically target anyone.

296
0:14:08.360 --> 0:14:10.080
But we might be able to say like,

297
0:14:10.080 --> 0:14:13.400
we're looking at the records based on who pushed the OK button.

298
0:14:13.760 --> 0:14:16.600
90% of players pushed the OK button that said that they'd read it.

299
0:14:16.880 --> 0:14:19.400
You know, we can get that kind of data and that becomes better.

300
0:14:19.760 --> 0:14:21.800
You know, if there's 90% of people pushed that button

301
0:14:21.800 --> 0:14:24.040
and there's still lots of complaints about people not reading it,

302
0:14:24.040 --> 0:14:25.960
maybe our message was worded wrongly.

303
0:14:25.960 --> 0:14:29.560
But it gives us a way to basically be a bit more data driven about the stuff.

304
0:14:29.560 --> 0:14:32.640
There's a lot of myths, which Ozzy is talking about, where I'm like,

305
0:14:32.640 --> 0:14:34.760
let's let's get data on it.

306
0:14:34.760 --> 0:14:36.200
Hey, I think that counts bad.

307
0:14:36.200 --> 0:14:37.720
Let's get data on it.

308
0:14:37.720 --> 0:14:41.480
Shifty has a great way of wording the personal rules.

309
0:14:41.760 --> 0:14:44.000
More restrictive, not less restrictive.

310
0:14:44.000 --> 0:14:47.600
But do keep in mind the stipulations in those guidelines

311
0:14:47.600 --> 0:14:50.160
that sort of get pulled away when you're in private laws.

312
0:14:50.760 --> 0:14:54.280
Duff says, why do I need to use the internet in order to use Minecraft?

313
0:14:54.280 --> 0:14:56.520
I don't know what's going on down there.

314
0:14:56.520 --> 0:15:00.480
I did notice that they're now breaking out of the sort of usual skin route.

315
0:15:00.480 --> 0:15:04.240
You can now have like hats, backpacks, wings and stuff like that,

316
0:15:04.440 --> 0:15:08.680
which break out of the sort of size of the regular Minecraft avatar.

317
0:15:09.000 --> 0:15:11.160
Of course, that is for money.

318
0:15:11.160 --> 0:15:12.360
But it was it was kind of cool.

319
0:15:12.360 --> 0:15:15.720
I also know a couple of people personally as friends who

320
0:15:16.520 --> 0:15:19.120
were making money off that Minecraft store

321
0:15:19.120 --> 0:15:21.400
even before they did that breaking out I'm talking about.

322
0:15:21.440 --> 0:15:22.400
They made skin packs.

323
0:15:22.400 --> 0:15:26.160
They sold them for mine coins, whatever it is, the like M gold.

324
0:15:26.440 --> 0:15:28.120
Like they were making money with it.

325
0:15:28.120 --> 0:15:30.360
And I actually don't think there's anything wrong with that.

326
0:15:30.360 --> 0:15:32.800
If it's cosmetic, great.

327
0:15:32.800 --> 0:15:35.800
It's like usually how the cosmetics are shown to the user.

328
0:15:36.080 --> 0:15:38.960
The fact that there can be user made, you know, creators

329
0:15:38.960 --> 0:15:41.120
are making these cosmetics in the Minecraft platform.

330
0:15:41.120 --> 0:15:42.440
That's even better, right?

331
0:15:42.440 --> 0:15:44.680
Sharing the love with the actual people that are making them.

332
0:15:45.760 --> 0:15:49.320
Other platforms are just like, hey, we make like we have a team.

333
0:15:49.640 --> 0:15:53.040
They crank out 50 shiny, sparkly,

334
0:15:53.360 --> 0:15:57.280
fantastic outfits a month and they all cost ten dollars.

335
0:15:57.760 --> 0:15:58.600
That's different.

336
0:15:58.600 --> 0:16:03.160
But no, these are these are friends and they make money off creating stuff

337
0:16:03.160 --> 0:16:05.560
that people can buy on that Minecraft store and wear in game.

338
0:16:06.560 --> 0:16:09.520
Moving onwards, Ozi says,

339
0:16:09.880 --> 0:16:13.360
do you have a tutorial on using the raw data tooltip hit for Raycast?

340
0:16:13.360 --> 0:16:14.360
It seems very on its usage.

341
0:16:14.360 --> 0:16:16.080
Yes. Only use that for tooltips.

342
0:16:16.080 --> 0:16:18.720
It like, you know how the lasers curve.

343
0:16:18.720 --> 0:16:19.480
I think about that film.

344
0:16:19.480 --> 0:16:20.440
I've mentioned it before on Office.

345
0:16:20.440 --> 0:16:21.640
I don't know why it keeps coming up.

346
0:16:21.640 --> 0:16:23.560
Wanted is a film where they curve bullets

347
0:16:23.560 --> 0:16:26.000
for like no apparent reason and ways that don't work.

348
0:16:26.000 --> 0:16:30.800
The reason why you use raw data tooltip hit is because that will follow that curve.

349
0:16:30.800 --> 0:16:34.720
Right. So it will follow the wiggly lasers to exactly where they hit.

350
0:16:36.440 --> 0:16:38.240
Raycast is is straight.

351
0:16:38.560 --> 0:16:39.880
Don't quote me.

352
0:16:39.880 --> 0:16:42.160
It's like raw data tooltip is not straight.

353
0:16:44.040 --> 0:16:48.480
When you're making a tool, wherever possible, please use raw data tooltip hit

354
0:16:48.480 --> 0:16:54.360
because it will handle things like desktop, VR, different controllers.

355
0:16:54.360 --> 0:16:58.400
The tooltip, what you call it, the tooltip anchor

356
0:16:59.600 --> 0:17:01.840
a lot better than than you possibly can.

357
0:17:01.840 --> 0:17:04.760
I notice a lot of my older tutorials for tools are basically like,

358
0:17:05.040 --> 0:17:08.240
find the tip and then like add a little bit to the front of it,

359
0:17:08.240 --> 0:17:10.840
because, you know, you're going to clip into someone's finger or hand.

360
0:17:10.840 --> 0:17:12.120
And so we add just a little bit.

361
0:17:12.120 --> 0:17:15.040
So it shoots out the front and gets clearance to go through.

362
0:17:15.360 --> 0:17:17.720
Or if you use raw data tooltip, it'll handle that for you.

363
0:17:17.720 --> 0:17:20.520
Like, you know how you can't filter a raycast to say like,

364
0:17:20.680 --> 0:17:23.400
hey, I want to hit this, but not this, but not that, but not this.

365
0:17:23.400 --> 0:17:24.520
You can't do that right now.

366
0:17:24.520 --> 0:17:26.280
Raw data tooltip can to some extent.

367
0:17:26.280 --> 0:17:27.800
So just use it for tools.

368
0:17:27.800 --> 0:17:29.360
I'll add it to my tutorial list.

369
0:17:29.360 --> 0:17:36.200
I was modeling some like molds for like bars in Blender yesterday,

370
0:17:36.200 --> 0:17:39.640
because the next tutorial I'm going to be doing is taking that ore

371
0:17:39.640 --> 0:17:42.600
from the mineable ore tutorial and forging it into bars.

372
0:17:42.600 --> 0:17:44.720
And then maybe we'll blacksmith them in a third tutorial.

373
0:17:45.040 --> 0:17:49.560
And then we'll have like half of a runescape like quest chain.

374
0:17:50.360 --> 0:17:52.520
I started modeling tutorials on runescape.

375
0:17:52.520 --> 0:17:55.160
I don't really know why. I'm just like, hey,

376
0:17:55.160 --> 0:17:56.640
people want to know how to mine ore.

377
0:17:56.640 --> 0:17:58.400
Maybe there's a tutorial about smithing.

378
0:17:58.400 --> 0:18:00.640
Maybe there's a tutorial about cooking coming up.

379
0:18:00.640 --> 0:18:03.160
Maybe we can do woodcutting next.

380
0:18:03.160 --> 0:18:05.040
There's plenty of content there.

381
0:18:05.040 --> 0:18:06.520
All right. Moving on to the next question.

382
0:18:06.520 --> 0:18:08.520
Zag asked, any use on UI updates?

383
0:18:08.520 --> 0:18:11.240
See the announcements channel for why again, we're a little bit slow there.

384
0:18:11.520 --> 0:18:13.040
It's important to remember.

385
0:18:13.040 --> 0:18:16.880
And I hope that once we get things moving again, we can adjust the way

386
0:18:16.880 --> 0:18:20.680
that we are representing the stuff to be a little bit clearer.

387
0:18:20.680 --> 0:18:24.600
I have some ideas there, which I'll be discussing with the team once we get moving.

388
0:18:25.600 --> 0:18:27.720
But it's important to make sure that you're looking at the right place

389
0:18:27.720 --> 0:18:28.920
for UI updates.

390
0:18:28.920 --> 0:18:31.760
The main roadmap, which is projects one.

391
0:18:31.760 --> 0:18:33.680
If you look at your address bar, it says projects one.

392
0:18:33.960 --> 0:18:37.600
It just says UI update and it's very sort of ambiguous and big.

393
0:18:38.080 --> 0:18:40.320
We found that that was difficult to deal with.

394
0:18:40.840 --> 0:18:46.240
And so there is the projects two board, which is more broken down.

395
0:18:46.520 --> 0:18:50.160
You can see here that preparing, gathering infos, redesign settings,

396
0:18:50.160 --> 0:18:52.480
which is what we were going to do next.

397
0:18:52.480 --> 0:18:55.280
Seems weird to do settings next, but actually allows us basically to be like,

398
0:18:55.280 --> 0:18:56.840
oh, someone doesn't like that.

399
0:18:56.840 --> 0:18:58.080
We can add a checkbox for it.

400
0:18:58.080 --> 0:18:59.160
Someone doesn't like that.

401
0:18:59.160 --> 0:19:00.600
We can add a checkbox for it.

402
0:19:00.600 --> 0:19:01.400
Right now we can't.

403
0:19:01.400 --> 0:19:04.280
There's just not enough room to explain that even better.

404
0:19:04.280 --> 0:19:07.160
Go open up the settings dialog for your favorite game

405
0:19:07.160 --> 0:19:09.800
and see how complicated that is and how many sub menus there are.

406
0:19:09.800 --> 0:19:10.840
We don't have that right now.

407
0:19:10.840 --> 0:19:12.360
We need to have that.

408
0:19:12.360 --> 0:19:13.920
We need to add that.

409
0:19:13.920 --> 0:19:20.560
All right, moving forwards.

410
0:19:20.560 --> 0:19:24.000
So it says that they need to go over how when to use Raycast one

411
0:19:24.000 --> 0:19:25.640
versus just using the constant Raycast.

412
0:19:25.640 --> 0:19:28.640
OK, so when I was a child,

413
0:19:29.480 --> 0:19:30.840
story time with pram.

414
0:19:30.840 --> 0:19:33.760
When I was a child, there was this magazine called Real Robots.

415
0:19:33.760 --> 0:19:37.480
If anyone else knows the magazine Real Robots, Real Robots team represent.

416
0:19:38.720 --> 0:19:41.600
And let me see if I can get a picture of this damn thing.

417
0:19:41.600 --> 0:19:45.720
Uh, robots magazine, I've still got the pieces somewhere

418
0:19:45.720 --> 0:19:48.480
and I feel so bad because it just got crazy.

419
0:19:48.840 --> 0:19:50.240
All right. Perfect.

420
0:19:50.240 --> 0:19:54.920
Absolutely perfect is here's a picture of how crazy real robots got.

421
0:19:54.920 --> 0:19:55.120
Right.

422
0:19:55.120 --> 0:19:58.160
So you started off in the in the middle with that like robot

423
0:19:58.160 --> 0:20:01.520
that could just sort of drive around and then they just kept adding stuff to it.

424
0:20:01.520 --> 0:20:01.840
Right.

425
0:20:01.840 --> 0:20:05.200
So if you look around the edge, there's like docks, there's like arms,

426
0:20:05.200 --> 0:20:07.560
there's like controllers and all sorts.

427
0:20:07.560 --> 0:20:09.440
You just kept going because they wanted to make more money.

428
0:20:09.440 --> 0:20:14.440
Point being, it had a line finder and it could follow a line.

429
0:20:14.440 --> 0:20:18.440
And the way it did that was essentially a real physical component

430
0:20:18.440 --> 0:20:20.760
that does a constant Raycast to find the line.

431
0:20:21.840 --> 0:20:23.320
Usually it can only see black lines,

432
0:20:23.320 --> 0:20:25.120
which detects the sort of brightness difference

433
0:20:25.120 --> 0:20:27.600
between the outside of the line and the inside of the line and follows it.

434
0:20:27.960 --> 0:20:30.240
But it's a perfect example of when you should be using Raycast

435
0:20:30.240 --> 0:20:33.600
is something like that, like a path finding robot or something like that.

436
0:20:33.920 --> 0:20:36.520
There are, of course, other cases,

437
0:20:36.520 --> 0:20:40.400
um, maybe like a laser beam at like a museum.

438
0:20:40.400 --> 0:20:43.480
You know, they all like do the ninja flips to get through the lasers.

439
0:20:43.480 --> 0:20:43.680
Right.

440
0:20:43.680 --> 0:20:47.040
You need that that laser to always be on and always be receiving data.

441
0:20:47.040 --> 0:20:49.520
Detective anyone's gone across it.

442
0:20:49.520 --> 0:20:52.320
But you could easily just do that with a collider.

443
0:20:52.320 --> 0:20:52.560
Right.

444
0:20:52.560 --> 0:20:55.960
That's the same shape and dimensions of the of the laser.

445
0:20:56.320 --> 0:20:57.200
Same laser harp.

446
0:20:57.200 --> 0:20:58.080
That's another good idea.

447
0:20:58.080 --> 0:20:59.600
But again, you could just use colliders

448
0:20:59.600 --> 0:21:01.280
with the same shape and dimensions of the laser.

449
0:21:01.280 --> 0:21:05.560
So like Raycaster doesn't isn't isn't needed.

450
0:21:05.560 --> 0:21:10.560
Um, Zag has a statement which is the one shot needs to keep the data present.

451
0:21:10.560 --> 0:21:11.240
It doesn't.

452
0:21:11.240 --> 0:21:14.560
So you need to remember that the Neos impulses

453
0:21:14.560 --> 0:21:16.400
are essentially like an event system.

454
0:21:16.400 --> 0:21:21.600
So if you look at a simpler example being a button.

455
0:21:21.960 --> 0:21:24.320
So there's a button on a Web page and you click it.

456
0:21:25.000 --> 0:21:28.680
Whenever you click any button on a Web page, like add to cart, sign in,

457
0:21:28.680 --> 0:21:31.000
whatever you want to call it, an event fires.

458
0:21:31.000 --> 0:21:33.960
And I know that you, because I have and most people have,

459
0:21:33.960 --> 0:21:37.520
have been frustrated with buttons not working and you might have spammed them.

460
0:21:37.920 --> 0:21:40.960
That creates an event for each button press that happens.

461
0:21:40.960 --> 0:21:43.160
And the website needs to process that.

462
0:21:43.160 --> 0:21:45.360
The same thing's going on with impulses.

463
0:21:45.360 --> 0:21:49.760
Each impulse coming out of there is one event and it has data associated with it.

464
0:21:50.120 --> 0:21:54.280
The reason why the data clears in quotes is because the event has finished

465
0:21:54.520 --> 0:21:57.120
and the data is cleared to make room for the next event.

466
0:21:57.480 --> 0:21:59.680
So what you need to do is you need to process the data

467
0:21:59.680 --> 0:22:04.600
as it's coming through in that impulse chain or save it if you don't need

468
0:22:04.600 --> 0:22:07.880
to use it within that impulse chain. That won't ever change.

469
0:22:08.240 --> 0:22:13.680
It's like literally a function of the engine doing what it's meant to.

470
0:22:14.040 --> 0:22:15.720
If it didn't clear the data,

471
0:22:15.720 --> 0:22:19.080
then it would be ambiguous about what your next raycast hit.

472
0:22:19.480 --> 0:22:21.960
If you like more examples of that, there's actually an example

473
0:22:21.960 --> 0:22:26.160
in the most recent tutorial I published, Mindable Ore, where I don't write anything.

474
0:22:26.560 --> 0:22:27.680
I don't write anything coming out.

475
0:22:27.680 --> 0:22:31.400
We can't add a second output that has lost it.

476
0:22:31.760 --> 0:22:33.200
That's not suitable.

477
0:22:33.200 --> 0:22:37.920
You just need to learn to use that node in an event driven way.

478
0:22:38.840 --> 0:22:41.240
And that will sort it out for you.

479
0:22:41.240 --> 0:22:43.400
If the impulse chain is too long, it's incorrect.

480
0:22:43.400 --> 0:22:46.360
It's if you use certain nodes on the impulse chain.

481
0:22:47.200 --> 0:22:50.840
Things like duplicate slot can have issues, things like delay,

482
0:22:50.840 --> 0:22:52.320
things like update delay.

483
0:22:52.320 --> 0:22:55.560
They can have issues because what they do is they shunt that impulse

484
0:22:55.560 --> 0:22:58.000
to off the current chain.

485
0:22:58.000 --> 0:22:59.640
They create a new impulse chain.

486
0:22:59.640 --> 0:23:02.360
You just need to rework your logic and use it.

487
0:23:02.520 --> 0:23:04.200
Like I'll link that tutorial I've got.

488
0:23:04.200 --> 0:23:06.760
I don't mean to basically be like, get good son.

489
0:23:06.800 --> 0:23:07.720
That's not what I'm saying.

490
0:23:07.720 --> 0:23:12.040
I'm saying here is like the reason why it's doing that is because it needs to.

491
0:23:12.320 --> 0:23:16.120
And if you use the the nodes in a more ideal way,

492
0:23:16.120 --> 0:23:19.840
you'll start realizing why that's happening in the future

493
0:23:20.560 --> 0:23:21.720
when we have collections.

494
0:23:21.720 --> 0:23:26.440
And I know it's like collections, green pastures and daisies.

495
0:23:27.800 --> 0:23:31.240
You'd probably be able to sort of like add the hits to a collection

496
0:23:31.240 --> 0:23:33.480
and then do operations based on those collections.

497
0:23:33.480 --> 0:23:36.520
So that would be a way around it because you'd be able to store

498
0:23:37.600 --> 0:23:39.600
dynamic amounts of data.

499
0:23:39.600 --> 0:23:41.160
The point right now is that you can't do it.

500
0:23:41.160 --> 0:23:44.120
So like if you want to store every single hit, go for it.

501
0:23:44.560 --> 0:23:46.560
But it really is a design problem.

502
0:23:47.280 --> 0:23:49.400
Heading on to dust question.

503
0:23:49.400 --> 0:23:52.200
I mean, issue where I set up the nearest cash place on a separate hard drive

504
0:23:52.200 --> 0:23:53.320
in steam startup process.

505
0:23:53.320 --> 0:23:54.840
And yet, despite installing

506
0:23:54.840 --> 0:23:56.800
nears on a separate drive and changing the cash path,

507
0:23:56.800 --> 0:23:59.760
it's still storing the cash data on a drive I didn't wish to get on.

508
0:24:00.720 --> 0:24:04.280
Let's double check your steam arguments.

509
0:24:04.280 --> 0:24:06.080
If you use the nearest launcher at any point,

510
0:24:06.080 --> 0:24:09.000
the nearest launcher needs to have identical command line arguments

511
0:24:09.000 --> 0:24:13.000
ran on it, otherwise it will move the cash elsewhere.

512
0:24:13.920 --> 0:24:17.760
Also, I'm not sure if you'll if you don't like notepad

513
0:24:17.760 --> 0:24:18.840
plus pass or something like that.

514
0:24:18.840 --> 0:24:22.400
What you can do is you can find in all the logs that you've got.

515
0:24:22.400 --> 0:24:24.760
You can find like I think there's a log line

516
0:24:24.760 --> 0:24:28.240
that says using cache directory or using cache, blah, blah, blah, blah.

517
0:24:28.520 --> 0:24:31.520
And if you can find all the examples of that and get them in a list,

518
0:24:31.760 --> 0:24:35.520
you'll be able to sort of pinpoint at this date on this time.

519
0:24:35.560 --> 0:24:39.240
This particular log file says that I wasn't running using my select cache.

520
0:24:39.240 --> 0:24:41.760
And then maybe that might jog your memory about what you did

521
0:24:42.480 --> 0:24:45.080
or maybe what you didn't do or if there was a problem.

522
0:24:45.440 --> 0:24:48.440
It basically be like, oh, this is why the cache was,

523
0:24:48.440 --> 0:24:50.200
you know, this particular run happened.

524
0:24:50.200 --> 0:24:51.360
What did I do that day?

525
0:24:51.360 --> 0:24:53.120
Oh, I forgot to use the launcher.

526
0:24:53.120 --> 0:24:56.400
Or maybe I reinstalled it or I updated things like it.

527
0:24:56.400 --> 0:24:58.280
Just point like a date and time out for you.

528
0:25:00.160 --> 0:25:01.360
That's a good question from Zack.

529
0:25:01.360 --> 0:25:03.880
She just says, how is the cash supposed to be used?

530
0:25:04.680 --> 0:25:07.000
It isn't. To not use the cash node.

531
0:25:08.920 --> 0:25:09.800
To me, it should be.

532
0:25:09.800 --> 0:25:12.520
And Zack says to me, it should be logically keep data

533
0:25:12.520 --> 0:25:14.160
and cool and clear, but doesn't do that.

534
0:25:14.160 --> 0:25:18.520
Yeah, honestly, the cache node is a layover and needs to be removed.

535
0:25:18.840 --> 0:25:20.640
If you search for it in the NES Discord,

536
0:25:20.640 --> 0:25:23.640
you might find freaks talking about it somewhere.

537
0:25:23.960 --> 0:25:29.080
But he made the functionality of cache sort of internal to the nodes

538
0:25:29.840 --> 0:25:31.280
that need to use cache.

539
0:25:31.280 --> 0:25:34.760
And so it's not really needed these days.

540
0:25:34.760 --> 0:25:36.440
We should remove it.

541
0:25:36.440 --> 0:25:38.880
Just, you know, dig a fish to fry right now.

542
0:25:38.880 --> 0:25:40.880
No, we need to remove it Sticks.

543
0:25:40.880 --> 0:25:42.640
We have this.

544
0:25:42.640 --> 0:25:44.880
Zack, let's look at your logics.

545
0:25:44.880 --> 0:25:48.240
The problem, I'm really sorry, and I don't mean to be mean about this,

546
0:25:48.240 --> 0:25:53.680
but the problem that you're having is a design of like a design problem

547
0:25:53.680 --> 0:25:55.640
that occurs after the raycast.

548
0:25:55.640 --> 0:25:56.960
Sticks, no, we would remove it.

549
0:25:56.960 --> 0:26:00.280
So we have functionality within our update process to find it,

550
0:26:00.280 --> 0:26:02.680
and we can smoothly just take it out.

551
0:26:02.680 --> 0:26:04.000
Like it does nothing.

552
0:26:04.000 --> 0:26:04.800
It does nothing.

553
0:26:04.800 --> 0:26:09.120
So it's like having a dead goldfish on the floor.

554
0:26:09.120 --> 0:26:11.720
It doesn't, dead goldfish flap is a bad example.

555
0:26:11.720 --> 0:26:13.960
But you know what I mean, it's like, it just, it doesn't do anything.

556
0:26:15.800 --> 0:26:20.360
Kip, I was asking, is the play and wait node the proper way to make a jukebox?

557
0:26:20.360 --> 0:26:23.000
Whilst making it play the system, I found that it was hard to stop the music

558
0:26:23.000 --> 0:26:27.680
without sending a pulse to start the next track in the update the year.

559
0:26:28.680 --> 0:26:32.560
Probably not play and wait, because that gives an event that might not return.

560
0:26:32.560 --> 0:26:35.720
With a jukebox, you have to remember that someone might be able to push play,

561
0:26:35.720 --> 0:26:38.080
pause, stop, change the track at any point.

562
0:26:38.080 --> 0:26:43.320
And so you really want to wait because like that wait might either never trigger

563
0:26:43.320 --> 0:26:45.320
or might trigger too soon or something like that.

564
0:26:45.320 --> 0:26:46.440
I would honestly just play it.

565
0:26:46.440 --> 0:26:49.880
And then when they hit next track, deal with it that way.

566
0:26:51.320 --> 0:26:52.960
Not quite sure of the issue there, though.

567
0:26:53.760 --> 0:26:59.880
The Neos tentative launcher, like the text box at the bottom,

568
0:26:59.880 --> 0:27:02.520
I think is where you can put in command line arguments.

569
0:27:02.800 --> 0:27:03.880
I honestly don't use it.

570
0:27:04.440 --> 0:27:07.360
All the Neos launcher does is it runs the Neos.exe.

571
0:27:07.360 --> 0:27:09.320
With, oh, no, you mean the tentative.

572
0:27:09.320 --> 0:27:10.000
Okay, no, no, no.

573
0:27:10.000 --> 0:27:14.600
So, hold on, there's too many things called launcher, right?

574
0:27:14.600 --> 0:27:17.040
There's the old launcher, it had all the check boxes.

575
0:27:17.040 --> 0:27:20.560
There's the new tentative launcher, which is just the Neos Pro launcher.

576
0:27:20.560 --> 0:27:22.720
But the Neos Pro launcher is another launcher.

577
0:27:22.720 --> 0:27:25.880
And then there's the Neos Classroom launcher, which no one uses except those

578
0:27:25.880 --> 0:27:29.640
that use Neos Classroom, which is, none of you guys, anyway, exists.

579
0:27:29.640 --> 0:27:31.920
Give me a second here.

580
0:27:31.920 --> 0:27:34.200
Maybe we need a launcher launcher.

581
0:27:34.200 --> 0:27:37.400
Launcher launcher, here we go.

582
0:27:38.840 --> 0:27:43.840
Here's the video called combined line arguments flags with the temporary launcher

583
0:27:43.840 --> 0:27:51.160
that will provide information about how you can add command line arguments to this.

584
0:27:51.880 --> 0:27:54.040
Kip says, the autoplay still needs to know when the track finishes.

585
0:27:54.040 --> 0:27:57.680
Yeah, use like fire on true position,

586
0:27:58.920 --> 0:28:02.200
normalized position greater than 0.9 or something like that.

587
0:28:02.200 --> 0:28:05.560
Yeah, that launcher, that video, though, should help you out.

588
0:28:05.560 --> 0:28:09.920
That launcher, the one that Duff has pictured here, which is the tentative launcher,

589
0:28:09.920 --> 0:28:12.880
also known as the Pro launcher over the campaign.

590
0:28:12.880 --> 0:28:17.840
All it does is download Neos.

591
0:28:17.840 --> 0:28:21.360
The two buttons there will just launch the EXE with a couple of command line parameters.

592
0:28:21.360 --> 0:28:25.480
Once it's downloaded the EXE, what I advise you do and probably talk about in that video

593
0:28:25.480 --> 0:28:29.200
is make shortcuts that will have different command line arguments.

594
0:28:29.200 --> 0:28:32.760
So you can create a shortcut and then you can have different command line arguments

595
0:28:32.760 --> 0:28:34.760
depending on what you're doing.

596
0:28:34.760 --> 0:28:36.840
With that, we're out of time.

597
0:28:36.840 --> 0:28:40.200
So if you have no more questions, I'll go ahead and end off here.

598
0:28:40.200 --> 0:28:42.840
If you have other questions, please feel free to direct message me.

599
0:28:42.840 --> 0:28:45.120
If you have any questions that you have or post on the Discord,

600
0:28:45.120 --> 0:28:49.840
we will take a look at them as soon as we can.

601
0:28:49.840 --> 0:28:53.720
I'll be back next week with more meanderings about Real Robots Magazine.

602
0:28:53.720 --> 0:28:57.520
I'm so disappointed that no one here was a Real Robots Magazine subscriber.

603
0:28:57.520 --> 0:29:01.800
But I will cut the recording here, cut everything off here,

604
0:29:01.800 --> 0:29:05.720
and I'm going to post a YouTube video of the Real Robots Magazine.

605
0:29:05.720 --> 0:29:08.600
Quickly, before I cut it, Zag asks, is there a custom node tutorial?

606
0:29:08.600 --> 0:29:11.600
No. There are a variety of ways to do it.

607
0:29:11.600 --> 0:29:17.560
I don't advise doing any of them unless you know exactly what you're doing.

608
0:29:17.560 --> 0:29:21.760
Most of the ways that you do it are great, but they won't allow you to pack it.

609
0:29:21.760 --> 0:29:26.600
So when you pack them, they'll mess up or they'll be weird.

610
0:29:26.600 --> 0:29:30.040
You can kind of get away with it when you use the mini redprints.

611
0:29:30.040 --> 0:29:31.800
That's not really like a custom node.

612
0:29:31.800 --> 0:29:35.200
That's just like a blueprint on top of a blueprint.

613
0:29:35.200 --> 0:29:38.360
Do take a look at that. Those do unpack well.

614
0:29:38.360 --> 0:29:43.240
But all of the custom node manufacturing thingies I've seen don't pack well

615
0:29:43.240 --> 0:29:47.160
and don't unpack well at all. I will speak to you later.

616
0:29:47.160 --> 0:29:50.560
Oh, Kip, Kip, I'll take the questions.

617
0:29:50.560 --> 0:29:54.600
OK, I'll take it. I'll take it.

618
0:29:54.600 --> 0:29:57.040
Shakes fist. OK, so there are two.

619
0:29:57.040 --> 0:30:00.560
So Kip asks how the logics interface components are used.

620
0:30:00.560 --> 0:30:04.160
So there are two components that are often misunderstood between both of those.

621
0:30:04.160 --> 0:30:07.880
So there is the logics interface component, which I believe should be

622
0:30:07.880 --> 0:30:10.520
on the actual rectangular things that float around.

623
0:30:10.520 --> 0:30:13.040
Everyone hates those.

624
0:30:13.040 --> 0:30:17.080
They are logics interfaces,

625
0:30:17.080 --> 0:30:21.240
logics interface card or floaty devils or whatever you want to call them.

626
0:30:21.240 --> 0:30:26.520
Now they handle all the connecting and handling between all the properties there.

627
0:30:26.520 --> 0:30:30.760
The logics interface proxy is the component

628
0:30:30.760 --> 0:30:34.120
which people hate and see everywhere and want to remove.

629
0:30:34.120 --> 0:30:38.360
Proxy components are basically a signpost for Neos to say like,

630
0:30:38.360 --> 0:30:40.760
hey, you might be looking for this. It's over here.

631
0:30:40.760 --> 0:30:44.400
So the way logics interface proxy is meant to work is that when you unpack

632
0:30:44.400 --> 0:30:48.200
and the logics unpacking process notices like, hey, I need an interface here.

633
0:30:48.200 --> 0:30:51.800
It's meant to look at the logics interface proxy and be like, oh,

634
0:30:51.800 --> 0:30:55.520
there is already an interface floating over here. I won't create a new one.

635
0:30:55.520 --> 0:30:59.560
I'll just look at the proxy and link it up to the existing logics interface.

636
0:30:59.560 --> 0:31:00.720
But that doesn't work.

637
0:31:00.720 --> 0:31:05.960
And that's why they will rotate, rescale themselves, reposition themselves,

638
0:31:05.960 --> 0:31:08.080
duplicate themselves, et cetera.

639
0:31:08.080 --> 0:31:11.240
I do want to comment a little bit about that problem.

640
0:31:11.240 --> 0:31:16.400
Every single person that has access to the code base of Neos has tried to fix this.

641
0:31:16.400 --> 0:31:17.720
Me included.

642
0:31:17.720 --> 0:31:23.520
We've all concluded that it is much better to just rewrite logics interfaces.

643
0:31:23.520 --> 0:31:25.880
It is very confusing.

644
0:31:25.880 --> 0:31:28.120
So we will fix that as soon as we can.

645
0:31:28.120 --> 0:31:30.040
And I understand the pain.

646
0:31:30.040 --> 0:31:32.960
I get really angry about it, especially when I unpack stuff

647
0:31:32.960 --> 0:31:37.400
and there's like eight people in the room because I'm just like, oh, God, what have I done?

648
0:31:37.400 --> 0:31:40.120
And then people are like, I can't read your logics once I unpack it.

649
0:31:40.120 --> 0:31:41.520
And I'm like, no, me neither, man.

650
0:31:41.520 --> 0:31:43.760
I'm just like, it uses interfaces.

651
0:31:43.760 --> 0:31:45.280
Nah, me neither.

652
0:31:45.280 --> 0:31:50.080
That's why dynamic variables, cloud variables, and even to some lesser extent,

653
0:31:50.080 --> 0:31:54.520
value fields are more still popular because at least the value field interface card

654
0:31:54.520 --> 0:31:57.720
is smaller than some of the other components.

655
0:31:57.720 --> 0:32:00.280
This is why components are popular.

656
0:32:00.280 --> 0:32:04.280
And that gets mistaken a lot for logic is bad because, you know,

657
0:32:04.280 --> 0:32:06.920
components, you don't have to deal with the interfaces.

658
0:32:06.920 --> 0:32:07.960
But logics is not bad.

659
0:32:07.960 --> 0:32:10.080
Use it when you need to.

660
0:32:10.080 --> 0:32:12.200
Is there a component to add two numbers together?

661
0:32:12.200 --> 0:32:14.240
Yes, the add.

662
0:32:14.240 --> 0:32:15.920
We will close off here.

663
0:32:15.920 --> 0:32:45.880
Bye bye.
