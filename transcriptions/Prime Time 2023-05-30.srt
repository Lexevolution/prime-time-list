1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 All right, we're gonna go ahead and get started as it is 4 p.m. So welcome to Prime Time.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,000
 This is the half hour, sometimes hour, segment where Prime rants about recycling and sometimes

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,120
 answers Nia's questions if they appear. If you'd like to get your question answered,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,740
 please drop it in the office hours text chat thread. That is a couple of channels above this one.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,500
 There is a thread dedicated for questions. Please drop them in there. They'll be answered in the order that they appear.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,520
 So we have some questions here and we're gonna go ahead and get started.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,800
 So first of all, we have a question from Lex that says "are there any projects you want to work on given infinite time?"

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,400
 Absolutely. So, um

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,420
 there are a few worlds that I have that

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,080
 have hidden things on them. I won't tell you which ones, but for those who are aware, please also don't tell them.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,800
 But there are a few worlds I have which have hidden things in them and

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,020
 I need to finish that because that was gonna be a huge big project that I never finished

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,960
 so I need to finish that, but I haven't had time to work on that in about three years.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
 So, you know, that's always fun.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,480
 Yeah, shout out to

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,720
 2019 Prime who thought that they could work on that forever and then join the Neos team and etc, etc.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,620
 Yeah, there are currently four finished. So there are four items to find. No one to my knowledge has found the fourth.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:20,040
 Next question, Beagle says "where's the Atlas field inside the point cluster cloud component? There's nothing about it on the wiki."

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,040
 I will go ahead and take a look. I have actually opened the code base today so I can go ahead and take a look.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
 Point...

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,040
 Point cloud...

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,760
 Point cluster, sorry. Point cluster. Point cluster mesh. There we go. Point cluster mesh.

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,200
 I'll take a look in just a second. He said Atlas. Let's take a look. Atlas info.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
 I think that's probably gonna render the point cluster a little bit like

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,640
 a little bit like a particle animation sheet because it uses Atlas info there.

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,260
 Yeah, it's gonna move the UVs of some of the points around to that

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,760
 to

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,400
 according to that Atlas. So you should be able to provide like a texture and then Atlas info there and it should

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,720
 should be there and

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,560
 shrink around there.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
 Atlas info. Yeah, you want to drop in an Atlas info component.

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,600
 You can take a look at how to use that via a different component. If you go to a tutorial I have on my planet...

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,840
 Yes, my planet of videos. My planet of videos, or I have the UV Atlas animator

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,080
 that uses the Atlas info component. So create an Atlas info component, grab the top white bar

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,300
 that says Atlas info and drop it into that Atlas section of the

36
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,360
 Atlas thingy.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,320
 Yeah, planet.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,600
 Let's see what we've got there. Specs comments on pouring out water for that one project everyone has to work on more later.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,960
 Yeah, it's it's like saddening.

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,360
 I'm sure you all have stuff just sort of

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,020
 in your computer, out of your computer, in your apartment, in previous apartments, sometimes even in my family's houses

42
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:04,060
 which I meant to work on later, but never have had time to. Wow English is difficult today.

43
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,360
 I need more coffee. Moving forwards, Reddy says what's with this website? It's a website.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,120
 You'll have to be more specific on your question. Beagle says how come a user has a thing Atlas info.

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,960
 Yeah, I think it's the Atlas info component. I'll play around with it a little bit. Maybe after this but

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,120
 it should just be dropping the Atlas. So go to the Neosensals assets particles.

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,220
 There's some sheets in there that look like smoke or fire etc.

48
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,960
 Use that as the texture and then drop in Atlas info and it should sort of

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,560
 make the point cloud use

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,480
 frames from that sheet. With that we're out of questions. I'm waiting for like a broom to arrive.

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
 This is gonna be like another tangent whilst we have - I will get back to questions at the moment, but like

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,160
 I'm waiting for a broom to arrive. So like my apartment has a balcony and I don't really use it.

53
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,860
 I didn't intend to use it, but then last year when I thought I was moving and then didn't move, I got rid of my

54
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,840
 chair that's out there, so I didn't really have any reason to go out there now.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,880
 But it's really dusty out there and I was like I'm gonna clean that because they'll charge me on the deposit for cleaning it

56
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,260
 so I'm gonna clean it. But then I realized I need like, you know, an ability to stand up and brush it.

57
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,440
 Otherwise, I'm gonna be on my hands and knees with a smaller brush. So

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,860
 like, you know, I need a brush I can stand up. So I brought like a, you know,

59
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,740
 a full-on like hard broom that you might use to clean an entire deck just for this like tiny balcony.

60
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,640
 But it's got a collapsible handle. So I'm hoping it'll save room. Sometimes I have to sort of get around this sort of

61
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,920
 mental space of eventually I'll own a house and I'll need a big broom like that for my big garden.

62
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,020
 Tiny balcony! Tiny balcony!

63
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,600
 Need clean!

64
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,320
 Yeah, for those who are unaware in America at least,

65
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,240
 the apartment complex companies will charge you for literally everything.

66
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,560
 Literally everything. They have no qualms about you basically moving out and then them going, "Yes,

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,440
 we're replacing the floors in your apartment and we're gonna charge you for that."

68
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,000
 And it's like I can understand if I damaged the floor, but like if you're just upgrading the apartment to a new floor,

69
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,460
 you can't charge me for that. It's just like what? But they try to so that's fun. They'll also be like, "Yeah,

70
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,380
 well, we'll have to repaint the entire apartment. So we'll charge you for that." And not only will they charge you for the paint there,

71
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,260
 they'll charge you the hourly cost that they pay the painter. So it's just really scummy or whatever.

72
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,620
 So I try and do as much as possible to get that down. Like for example,

73
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,640
 cleaning that balcony will take me the cost of the broom, which is I don't know like $11, and I don't know, an hour or two

74
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 to brush it or whatever.

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,840
 So $11.

76
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,160
 But if they charge me, it'll be the cost of the labor for the maintenance person to brush it,

77
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,280
 which will be more than $11. I have a mop, I have a vacuum cleaner, and I have a small,

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,540
 like we call them dust buses, like a small handheld vacuum, which I use if I don't get the big vacuum out.

79
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,120
 I also do have a brush, but I don't like with a vacuum and a mop, I'm good. When I say broom as well,

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,520
 I mean brush, right? It's a hard brush broom rather than like what like, you know,

81
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,800
 Gildy broom. All right, moving on to questions. Like I said, I'd answer them the moment they appeared and they were talking about brooms.

82
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,600
 Lucas says "May I ask what's currently been working on development-wise? Last I heard of Geens was starting work replacement for Unity.

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
 How's that coming along?" I don't know, you'd have to ask Geens about that particular one. That's continuing.

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,360
 It's an open source project outside of Neos, which of course means it like it's free from bullshit.

85
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,240
 So, I mean it has bullshit for other reasons because it's a complicated thing to replace Unity, but you know,

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,680
 I mean like it's free from Neos bullshit. "As for development-wise,

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,120
 you can check our roadmap available on the Neos public thing for what we are currently working on?" Yes,

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,760
 I know that hasn't been updated in forever, but that is all the information available, additional information will be available in the Announcers channel.

89
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:57,320
 Moving forwards to Baxter's question. Baxter says "There's a rotation scale. You can see information available to build more materials.

90
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,560
 So I've heard but I've not encountered information on that. Do you have a quick insight into that or a video available somewhere?

91
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,040
 Is there something you don't touch yourself?" I have not touched billboards. Every time I think about billboards,

92
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,520
 I'm like, I don't know why I wouldn't use a particle system or a point cloud mesh.

93
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,040
 Like for example, you could like take like a model of a cat and you can apply like a billboard material to it.

94
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,160
 But then you just have like a cat shaped particle cloud. I don't really know why you need that.

95
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,600
 Alex asks "What if they do that? I'll string all over again." They will.

96
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,720
 But I also plan to get a cleaner to do a pass on this once all my furniture's out.

97
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,320
 And that cleaners invoice and details will be left in the apartment like on the side. They're free to ignore it, of course,

98
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,400
 but like when they start saying "We're charging you a cleaning fee." I'm like, yeah, I already got it professionally cleaned, so piss off.

99
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,140
 I'll be able to get a better deal. Cyberfrog asks

100
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,080
 "Is there plans for creating own shaders in runtime?"

101
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,640
 Um, yeah, so what we want to do is want to create like a shader style system that similar to logics in that

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,600
 you can link together, which is also similar to sort of logics plus blender shading nodes, right?

103
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,680
 So rather than writing shader code, you can link together those nodes.

104
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,960
 The reason why we want to do it that way rather than allowing you to upload your own shader code is because

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,520
 we need to keep backwards compatibility done, particularly seeing as we won't be staying on Unity forever.

106
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,320
 And that means we can't just say "Hey, get poly on me," because like, you know,

107
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,120
 we just can't. Like it just it locks us into a sort of compatibility layer where, you know,

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,520
 two or three years down the line, we have to remove the ability to use poly on me and people are mad at us again,

109
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,640
 so we'd rather they'd be mad at us without us doing the work.

110
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,320
 Like you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't see much, well not in this particular case.

111
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,760
 You think you can inspect the MMC trophies? As far as I remember,

112
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,240
 they're shape keyed animations, which means they are a little bit unperformant, but like they're cool.

113
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,000
 I don't think they're billboard. It might be though. I don't know. I didn't inspect one, that was like last year though.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,320
 So I'm not gonna like remember that.

115
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,160
 Revy says "Is something gonna happen sometime soon? I've been hearing rumors with this new studio under frugs. Feels like you guys are getting somewhere."

116
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,240
 All rumors are false unless they are in the announcements channel.

117
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,720
 And I hate to say that and be very deliberate about it, but all rumors are false.

118
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,320
 Prime doesn't have pink hair.

119
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,520
 Neos is not being purchased by Kroger supermarkets. You can just make rumors up whenever you want.

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,920
 What I'd say to rumors is if you turn back round to the person who gave you that rumor and said "That's very

121
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,720
 disingenuous of you to provide a rumor to me that you have no source of.

122
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
 Do you have a source of this rumor?"

123
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,560
 And if they say "yes" and the rumor source is not the announcements channel,

124
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,480
 then you ask that person to go back to their source and ask them why they think it's appropriate to make silly rumors.

125
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,080
 It's inappropriate, and that's all I'll say on that matter.

126
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,800
 As for the comment of "Is something gonna happen anytime soon?" Check the announcements channel.

127
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,120
 All available information will be in the announcements channel when we're able to share it, if we're able to share it, when we're able to share it.

128
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
 Whatever it might be.

129
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,960
 I hate to sound like a broken record there.

130
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,280
 I know that people hate me for being a broken record there, but think about it from our perspective.

131
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,000
 We have people all throughout the Neos community that are like "Yeah, so I heard that

132
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,640
 the People's Republic of Congo is gonna purchase Neos." I'm just like "What? Like who the, like what?"

133
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,080
 I'm like "No!"

134
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,960
 Just like it's ridiculous, right?

135
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,240
 So the only official information we have is available in the announcements channel.

136
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,760
 And if there is no available information in the announcements channel, don't then immediately say "But there is no information in the announcements channel."

137
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,640
 There is. It's just all the information we have is already in there.

138
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,840
 Moving forwards, Lex says "Are groups able to get any more storage than 10 gigabytes?" I don't think so at this time.

139
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,500
 We're able to sort of expand our storage offering

140
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,600
 configurations at this time due to everything else going on.

141
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
 Particularly with

142
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
 trying to sort of

143
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
 I can't really answer that one.

144
00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:00,160
 Beagle says "On that are we able to do motor groups?" Yeah, I think so. I own like three, so yeah.

145
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,680
 Check the Patreon tiers for how many groups you'll be able to create there, as I am on the Neos team.

146
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,960
 Sometimes I will have additional groups for various sort of technical reasons.

147
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,640
 Beagle says "What time are we getting on Neos to Mess with Atlases?"

148
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,160
 Tell you what, like can, I never know, like can you share a screen on stages? If you can do that,

149
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,880
 I'll try it at the end, and I'll just keep it going and you can do that.

150
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,460
 I would drop into like one of the regular voice channels,

151
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,820
 but like we know what's gonna happen there, like 50 people will join, all talk at once, and then like mess will occur.

152
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,840
 Or I just record a quick two-minute video and upload it. I think I know how to use it,

153
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,740
 I'm not sure, but like I think it would be like probably like five minutes or so just to take a look at it.

154
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,980
 In that case, I should start Neos. I really do think it's gonna be like less than five minutes,

155
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,740
 so I'll do it right at the end. Oh, that's an old thread. I should lock the threads. Thank you for forwarding that across, Mike.

156
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:58,020
 Peach Clover asked, "Everyone who refuses to use Neos whines about the lack of P.O.M.I. Will there be a P.O.M.I. converter to win the MontaN.I.O.S.?"

157
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,220
 We can get close to P.O.M.I.S., we can't get exactly to P.O.M.I.S.

158
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:07,580
 One of the most annoying things I have when it comes to P.O.M.I.S. is discussing what they want from it. As a good example here,

159
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:13,100
 if you go into a paint store, and in that paint store, you're looking for a particular color of paint,

160
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,020
 instead of describing the paint color, like I would like a blue paint, you just name it.

161
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,860
 I'd like a jar of Ocean Breeze, and we're like, well, we're Prime's paint store, and we don't stock Ocean Breeze,

162
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,740
 but if you could describe Ocean Breeze to me, I can show you a vast array of colors that look similar to what you're describing.

163
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,260
 They're like, no, I just want Ocean Breeze. It's like, just like, is that like a, you know, a cyan-y blue?

164
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,740
 Is there like, you know, more green in there? Because like, you know, it's a paint store.

165
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,900
 We've got like swatches and tubs, we got every color of paint. We just don't call it Ocean Breeze,

166
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,300
 so if you could just describe the color Ocean Breeze, then we would be great.

167
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,900
 Yeah, if you expect like regular users who go into paint stores to know Panetone, then...

168
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,940
 Not Panetone. Pantone? Yeah, like, it's not gonna happen.

169
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,100
 I hope that like, kinda makes sense. Like, I've had it so many times though, people are like,

170
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,820
 I want Pyomies, and then I find out they want it because their horns need to be RGB, like strobing,

171
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,980
 and I'm like, well, we could just do that without Pyomies. And they go, oh!

172
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,740
 And then I set it up for them, and then they go, oh, I guess I don't need Pyomies then.

173
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,020
 It's just like, tada! I've thought about doing one of those meme-y videos,

174
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,820
 like actually a series of them, you know, it's like, 10 things you don't need mods for on Neos.

175
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,140
 10 things you don't need plugins for on Neos. 10 things that just work on Neos,

176
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,860
 because so many people just don't understand, like, things like flying and scaling,

177
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,540
 they don't understand that they can just happen, right? You don't need any mods or any capabilities

178
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,140
 to them, because their only frame of reference is VRChat, where they do need mods to fly,

179
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,780
 change their size and all this sort of stuff. I've been thinking about doing that,

180
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,100
 and maybe I'll do another video which is like, 10 things you don't need Pyomies for.

181
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,940
 Back to the says, "But events happen locally, but collider events fire. For everyone,

182
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,260
 would it be practical to create a physics collision check node that only runs on character colliders,

183
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,140
 specifically ones that have an active user to create local collision events?"

184
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,420
 That's what you're trying to do. Like, if you're doing a character collider, it's usually like,

185
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,220
 some sort of barrier, a teleport, or like a culling thingy, and there are components

186
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,900
 available for all of that, which will do it a lot more proficiently than those nodes.

187
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,740
 So if you tell me a scenario, maybe I can help out a little bit more there.

188
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,780
 You can actually just run it through an if, and be like, if, and then like, target user,

189
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,020
 like local user is target user. I was like, wait a minute, which number key and desktop

190
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,660
 nodes spots the logic strip? I forgot. Ah, okay. Yeah, physics. There's no actual node

191
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:51,300
 that's like, is local user inside? There is on the character, what's it called, the thing,

192
00:14:51,300 --> 00:15:04,180
 the component. Character something. Someone help me out here, it's the one where you collide

193
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:11,780
 a user tracker. Thank you, Nitra. Thank you. Physics utility. Thank you. The thing, you

194
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:20,100
 know, the thing that does the thing and has the behavior of thing. You can plug in the

195
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,900
 output, the second output of onCollisionStart into getActiveUser or whatever, because that

196
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,820
 like, the output is a collider, and then you can get the active user of the collider that

197
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,900
 you're colliding with. That's a real fast way of doing it. Sometimes yes, sometimes

198
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,620
 no. It just depends how things work. Yeah, we got it. Alex, let me just go ahead and

199
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,180
 lock the old thread so that we just, there we go. How dare I not remove every component

200
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,940
 all the time, even though sometimes they change names and locations and, you know, once we

201
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,180
 have a component and a tatcher that has searching, I want to change up the location of a bunch

202
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,260
 of them. Let me check my emails again. Has my broom arrived? My broom has not arrived.

203
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,060
 I'm so... Because if it arrives before it gets dark, I can do that today, and that'd

204
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,260
 be an arm off my to-do list. But if it arrives after it's dark, I'm not going to be out there

205
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:15,700
 at nighttime, like cleaning. Cleaning my patio. Yeah, something like that, Alex. That's good.

206
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,260
 Might be able to bypass the get slot, I'm not sure. Because we don't have getActiveUser

207
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,660
 for a component. Oh, we do. Yeah, that worked. Yeah. I think it works, I don't know if it

208
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,220
 works. You can try faster than I am, the one hosting office hours, let me know how it goes.

209
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,900
 Problem with a material video is, it's again unclear what people want. Sometimes they want,

210
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,380
 like a big common one we have is the sparkles, right? So something in Pyumi is able to make

211
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,660
 an avatar look really sparkly. You know, you look at them, like you might look at sort

212
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:56,980
 of like one of those expensive glass sculptures you can get... hold on, let me get a picture.

213
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,420
 Yep, that's exactly, that is exactly what I was saying. Sometimes, you can buy these,

214
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,340
 like, I wouldn't recommend it, but like, they're the glass art, right? Sometimes it's like,

215
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,140
 people want their surface texture to look like that, they want it to like twinkle and

216
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,380
 stuff like that, so again. But sorry, I managed to make that work. A lot of times as well,

217
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,420
 they just want scrolling textures, and we can just support that. One thing we are limited

218
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,140
 on though is independently scrolling different maps. So a lot of times in some of our materials,

219
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:32,580
 you can only scroll all of the maps, you can't scroll just once, you won't be able to just

220
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,140
 scroll the emission or just scroll the albedo, sometimes the albedo and the emission will

221
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,260
 scroll at the same time, and I get that, that can be problematic. Because if you can isolate

222
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,860
 just the emissions to scroll, then it means that you can get sort of like ribbons, bands,

223
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,020
 and shapes of light that move across the avatar that don't affect the actual albedo. Because

224
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,900
 if you scroll the albedo, then your eyes and your lips and your face and your nose also

225
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,540
 scroll and that looks creepy. Alright, scrolling around, making sure there are no additional

226
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,460
 questions. There are no additional questions that I can currently see. That's a good question

227
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,940
 from AgriPilot. I'll read it and then I'll go immediately to the code and take a look.

228
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,180
 Why does the component context menu item source not get disabled when the slot is disabled

229
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:20,460
 that it is on? I think I know why. Yeah, that's just a design thing. So what happens with

230
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:29,020
 the context menu item components is once you've created them and you open the context menu,

231
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,180
 we scan your hierarchy for root context menu items and then we descend from there to find

232
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,540
 context menu item sources. And because we're scrolling through those, we're just using,

233
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,780
 internally we're just using code that gets components and doesn't really care about the

234
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,980
 slots, so we don't really have any information about the slot. The way around that would

235
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,740
 be to look at the slot and pay attention to the slot, or once you have the component,

236
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,000
 get the slot that the component is on and then look at that enable property. Sometimes

237
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,820
 it makes sense to do that, sometimes it doesn't. Like I can imagine that there might be cases

238
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,980
 where someone has accidentally disabled their context menu. That's probably something we

239
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,500
 can fix. Like Slick says that we can't avoid get slot because it doesn't work correctly.

240
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,660
 So yeah, that's something you can probably sort out. We should be able to go from a component

241
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,940
 to a slot. There was something we were trying to do with Logix where we were trying to sort

242
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,460
 of like detect that people were doing stuff like that and then automatically spawn nodes

243
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,580
 that were more logical. The two straight bars that you sometimes see are touching each other

244
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,700
 of different colors, that's called a cast. We were trying to basically add to that cast

245
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,860
 system and be like, there is not an easy way to cast these, but there is a node which will

246
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,340
 do this properly. So instead of auto-generating the cast, we would auto-generate the get slot

247
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,780
 node for you. So we wanted to do that at some point. There's a path, like lots of times

248
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,860
 there's a path. We also wanted to do that for URI. URI is a mess. What we did originally

249
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:57,700
 was we added nodes that look like, resemble, and behave like cast nodes, but aren't actually

250
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,840
 cast nodes. They are like URI construction nodes, and it just caused a bunch of mess.

251
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,820
 So we wanted to fix that so that it would spawn the appropriate URI nodes, and that

252
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,700
 was on my plate like three years ago, and I actually didn't do anything other than coding.

253
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,300
 Player Cody asks, is there a tutorial that talks about mapping a physical object that

254
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,940
 drives the volume meter from the audio output? I think you probably mean the volume on an

255
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,980
 audio output. So you're talking about like a physical volume bar. I don't particularly

256
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,180
 know why this popped into my head, but like, you know, how high you raise a coconut in

257
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,780
 the skies, how high the volume is. That would be very easy to do. There is no tutorial that

258
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,980
 has been created about it, but it would be easy to do. You just get the sort of relative

259
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,340
 change in position of said coconut, and drive the volume of the audio output from it. I

260
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,860
 have no idea why I thought of coconuts, but you know, there we go. Broom will be here

261
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:59,740
 by 8pm. There's also that bad UX trend meme where they create really bad volume meters.

262
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,420
 It would be great to see a collection of those. I won't be updating the wiki, I'll probably

263
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,900
 just record a video and dump it there, because I'm really busy. But like I said, it should

264
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,220
 be less than five minutes for me to figure out how in game. And we'll do that at the

265
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,300
 end here. I'll stop the recording, and I'll be like "the recording has stopped!" but

266
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,100
 then I'll just share my screen here. I don't wanna put like, you know, "ah, that'd be

267
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,100
 great." Or like, you know those sculptures where you balance forks and bottles and stuff?

268
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:34,940
 Yeah, this stuff, right? This is how you control the volume of an audio source, you have to

269
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,940
 balance bottles like this. No, that wasn't a question. Thank you Lex, thank you. That

270
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,100
 wasn't answered. Bacta says "I want to be able to define how materials map images to

271
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,900
 the UV map, I know Trig for a reason, dang it I want things to spin." I didn't really

272
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,860
 see that as a question. That's not really a question. With that I do believe we're out

273
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,380
 of questions, if anyone else has a question please go ahead and type it, I'll give you

274
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:02,860
 a few seconds to do that whilst I figure out... let me get like... I need a point cloud, like

275
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,380
 where can I get a point cloud? Beagle, you got a point cloud I can use? Send me one.

276
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,620
 Oh no, if you're not in Neos, don't worry about it, I'm sure I can find one. I think

277
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,740
 there's one in Neos Essentials. Yeah, I got one in Neos Essentials, it's a ring. That'll

278
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,660
 do. Alright, so we got a few more questions. I'll go through these questions, then we'll

279
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,700
 stop the recording, I'll go live, and then it should all work out. Like at the end of

280
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,540
 the day you'll still be able to go to bed, that's what you've got to realize sometimes,

281
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,380
 at the end of the day if your broom arrives or your broom doesn't arrive you can still

282
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,260
 go to bed and sleep. Anyway, Specs says "Any mesh you can convert it to a point cloud?"

283
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,860
 Of course you can. Alex says "Will there be an official component on logic searcher?"

284
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,340
 Yes, you can find that on our roadmap. Peach says "Who's a quilt clone, is there a tool

285
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,740
 I would like to resize when it is equipped, how do I do this?" There's a video on that

286
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,580
 one, where I make a tool out of an elephant. There's lots of people struggling with that

287
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:06,100
 one. That is a really old video, but it should work. Playa Curdi clarifies "Smaller positional

288
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,700
 object that dictates the volume, like the object's starting point, is audio volume 0

289
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,580
 and the slider goes far to where the volume reaches." Yeah, that's just a slider, that's

290
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,100
 exactly what we're talking about. I know you can't hear the audio right now, and I will

291
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,180
 try and get the recording up here. Look, I know I've been sloppy about that one, but

292
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:26,220
 like, hey, last week's office hours just transcribed itself so I can get that one done. I don't

293
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:32,620
 need a thing, Beagle, I've got a thing, I found one. Alex says "An inventory searcher?"

294
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:38,340
 Yes, it's on the roadmap. Icecreampie asks about fog volumes, I don't, I haven't used

295
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,780
 fog volumes, I'm sure someone in here has, I'm just gonna throw some onto the bus here.

296
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,380
 Specs! Okay, you're thrown under the bus, enjoy. I'm sure Specs has used a fog volume.

297
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,100
 If not I do see a few other people lurking that might be able to help. That's untrue,

298
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:57,900
 I've used one in one of my worlds, but Vigilab set that up for me. With that, I'm gonna cut

299
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,280
 off questions there, I'm gonna stop the recording, so I'll say good, okay we got like, one question

300
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,500
 just slipped in, so we'll go for it. We'll go for it. "Would it be possible to make it

301
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,740
 so Logix works a bit more visual coding where you pull from a node, drop it in the air,

302
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,460
 search for it?" Yeah, that's, we also want to add node searching, and something similar

303
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,580
 to the way Blender does it, where there's like a search bar, yeah. Now that's it. No

304
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,260
 more questions. See you next week for those on the recording, for those not on the recording,

305
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,020
 I'll show you how to use the point cluster mesh in a Sherry thingy, and I'll also record

306
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,660
 it to OBS and shove it in my random info playlist, which is where I do low-effort content. Alright,

307
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,500
 bye bye!
