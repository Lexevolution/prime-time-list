1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
 It is 4pm, so we're going to get that started.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,200
 Let's jump straight into the questions that we have in the thread.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
 So Lex says "What are the plans for Neocene again?"

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,280
 So Neocene was like, it's unfair to call that like a backup, but it's like an addition

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,080
 to the big chunky launcher, right?

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,740
 We would be remaking the big chunky launcher and making that into like our own launcher.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,020
 So that would also allow us to have more of a backup in case the things like the steam

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,000
 removal happened again, whatever, we'd have our own launcher, etc.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,180
 But it would also allow us to sort of more simultaneously manage builds.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,000
 So if there was any testing needed, or people wanted to jump between the headless or the

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,120
 quest build, or the android build, etc. they'd be able to do it a lot easier.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,720
 We'd also be able to serve builds there for different establishments, such as businesses,

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,840
 education, learning, etc.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,180
 Yeah, that was what Neocene was meant to be.

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,960
 Next up we have hentai games who says "What's the status of the lawsuit and when are we

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
 getting an update?"

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 I don't know what that is.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,640
 I mean, my suit's in the cupboard, but like, I don't know what that is.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,520
 So I don't know.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,760
 And with that, we're out of questions.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,200
 So Jack asks "Is Neocene accompanied by a change in the build/deploy pipeline too?"

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,040
 Yeah, the idea there was to update how the build pipeline and the deployment pipeline

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
 works.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:38,760
 It would have been a great actual hero scenario for the recent Cloudflare, YouTube download,

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,760
 MMC 2023 issues where we had builds being unsynchronized.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,520
 Right now, builds that are generated are like three different pipelines, and so it's really

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,680
 difficult sometimes to manage them.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,560
 Neocene would completely streamline that, and we'd be able to do that a lot easier.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,360
 Lou says "What tips practices would you recommend for inventory management?"

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,480
 I actually have a video on this one as far as I'm aware.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,420
 Let me go ahead and double check if I can find it.

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,740
 It's been working really well outside of Neos as well, it does require diligence, and sometimes

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,680
 you'll end up clicking a lot of folders.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,520
 But if you start doing it, it really does prevent many issues.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,720
 People go "There is no inventory management in Neos, so I won't inventory manage."

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,240
 And I go "Okay, cool.

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,760
 You could do a little bit of it."

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,320
 So yeah, but then all the stuff I hadn't managed would still be there.

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,680
 I was like "Well, yeah, but you can do the new stuff."

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 When did I upload that video?

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,480
 I've not got a staff badge there, I've only got one row, and I'm wearing a center hat.

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,440
 That's gonna be well dated, let me see.

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,280
 Strangely the date isn't displayed in YouTube Studio, I have to go to the actual video.

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
 Two years ago!

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,840
 15 December 2020, fantastic.

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,000
 I didn't answer the question, because it assumes things that don't exist, or might not exist.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,640
 It's a very strange question.

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,400
 I guess the second half, yes, the second half, that's a better answer for the second half,

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,200
 which is "Any updates will be in the announcements channel."

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,600
 And before you say there are no updates in the announcements channel, yes, any future

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,720
 updates will be in the announcements channel.

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,300
 You can compare it to that one thing that you pre-ordered on the internet two years

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,880
 ago and it never shipped and then suddenly randomly arrived today.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,520
 I've got edi controllers sat next to me charging.

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:36,320
 If you find checking the announcements channel problematic, you can always go to this amazing

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,760
 URL.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,200
 Jack has an overarching question.

58
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,240
 What things are planned, considered for future improvements to new users' audio systems,

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,640
 and better reverb zones, deafening zones, etc.

60
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,360
 I would like to, firstly, in my opinion, I guess, and then for what we're actually doing,

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,280
 you can go ahead and check the roadmap, but I would like to see, we were looking into

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,100
 it, I can't remember why we stopped, but we were looking into a different audio system

63
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,860
 that would allow the structure of the area that you're in to affect the audio in some

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,280
 way, like walls and doorways and stuff like that would have affected the audio.

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,260
 I'd have to go double check what the name of that library that we were looking at is,

66
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,900
 but that doesn't, I can't remember the name of it, etc.

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,900
 We are using Steam audio right now for some things, I think we want to upgrade that.

68
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:36,240
 I would like to see more tweaks to the logarithmic falloff, I would also like to see better tooling

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,700
 to visualize that as well.

70
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,540
 It would be great if we had similar debug visuals to things like the reflection probe

71
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,300
 and the default cube editing for the falloff of audio, because I know most people just

72
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,400
 don't care, and they leave the falloff on logarithmic, they leave the sound at 100%,

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,540
 and then everyone just complains because audio is always too loud, no one balances their

74
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
 audio.

75
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,140
 Quick reminder there, balance your audio.

76
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,740
 Here's how to balance your audio.

77
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,180
 Set all of your audio bars to 100%, and then walk through your experience, your world,

78
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,060
 your tool, etc., and figure out what needs to be quieter, what needs to be louder, what

79
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,720
 you shouldn't hear from across the map, what you should hear across from the map, and then

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,660
 you can normalize it there.

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,300
 For anyone who doesn't agree with setting their audio levels to 100%, remember that

82
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,240
 the word 100% in the audio level means 100% of normal, or as in the intended way that

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,460
 the author wants this experience to be established with you.

84
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,360
 So if you're running at like 2% audio, like I know most people are, then you're missing

85
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,760
 out on a lot of range that you can have there.

86
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,320
 Let's say you're making a horror map, you know, maybe footstep sounds, sorry excuse

87
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,200
 me, are very quiet, but like the monster screaming and tearing you into pieces, that should be

88
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
 a bit louder.

89
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,780
 You get more range there if you use the entire audio bar, rather than just the bit that occurs

90
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,420
 between 2% and 0%.

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,300
 Lexis, the ETE controllers don't work with Neos anymore?

92
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
 They do.

93
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,380
 I think the path for using them is a bit different, but I've been collaborating with some of the

94
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,620
 people in the ETE Discord about that.

95
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:17,660
 We have Silver, they are probably in this Discord, but Silver here is doing some logics

96
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,160
 with the ETE controllers.

97
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,860
 It might be some facilities or gestures etc that don't work.

98
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
 I don't know.

99
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,680
 Mine arrived, and one was charged to full, and one wasn't charged to full, so I just

100
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,020
 put them all on charge.

101
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,600
 I actually sent, I could find this library again, because I sent an email to the library

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,660
 creator, because it's not licensed.

103
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,500
 Unfortunately like Gmail searching is just terrible.

104
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,460
 Maybe it wasn't on that account.

105
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,600
 I might have sent it from, it would make sense if I sent it from this account.

106
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
 Yes, here it is.

107
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,000
 Yeah, it's here.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,880
 There's literally no license, no information about it.

109
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,000
 Acoustic echo cancelling, voice suppression, voice activity detection.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,300
 Very good module.

111
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,800
 I asked for a license, they said no.

112
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,440
 They said that it's open source, I don't want to give it a license, so I just said okay,

113
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
 and we didn't use it.

114
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,720
 I don't even remember why we did it.

115
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,900
 Frix asked me to look into seeing if I could get them to clarify the license, so I was

116
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
 doing the email back and forth there.

117
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,220
 Okay, jumping back up to questions, because I forgot them.

118
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,800
 Glavin says are there plans to have a native built-in user calling system?

119
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,380
 I would love for the halls like that to kind of be drop-in and easy to use.

120
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,680
 We would of course make it so that you can disable them or build your own, because we

121
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,700
 don't want our tools to supersede or block the custom creation of additional tools.

122
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,960
 But I would love for more logical systems to exist.

123
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,680
 I know that VRChat has done some amazing stuff with culling, both audio and avatar related,

124
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,640
 which we should absolutely emulate, and then someone starts saying, "No, you're going to

125
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,200
 steal it or copy it from VR."

126
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
 It's like, come on, guys.

127
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,560
 I am complimenting VRChat on a pre-feature, well-created, and saying that we could emulate

128
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,520
 similar features on our platform, that's totally fine.

129
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,680
 Jack comments that there's stuff that Logics can't do, like reduce update rates and stuff

130
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
 like that.

131
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,400
 Yes, if we made a system, it would have a lot more capabilities than Logics.

132
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,620
 However, we could take a look at providing additional components, nodes, etc., that would

133
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,040
 allow that additional functionality to be established.

134
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,600
 Something like that, when we're giving you more control over the world, might have to

135
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,120
 wait for hard permissions, though, because at that point we are enabling you to kind

136
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
 of damage the world.

137
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,820
 A bit like the knockback gun problem, we gave people the functionality to accelerate people

138
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,440
 at the speed of light, and that's cool, because you can make guns and stuff that knock people

139
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,880
 back, but if you crank those numbers up all the way, then weird stuff happens.

140
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,940
 So if you did that, the same with IK or culling and stuff like that, there might be some worse

141
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,560
 consequences for that that we'd have to sort of handle.

142
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,900
 Jack mentions the IK culling mod, yeah, I've looked into that one.

143
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,080
 Every mod I look into the source code of, I'm like, I'm sorry, guys, I'm so sorry, because

144
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,260
 it's like one line of code to change something that annoyed people.

145
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,320
 Jack asks, did you ever find your personalized easter egg in our MMC entry?

146
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,880
 You'll have to unfortunately remind me of which gear and which entry.

147
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,960
 I looked at far too many, and oftentimes it was not clear who worked on the list, or if

148
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,360
 it was, it was just a big list that sort of merged into one.

149
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,200
 No, in which case I did not notice it on dashcam.

150
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,960
 There was actually, that was like, I know it's like, you know, months away from MMC

151
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,920
 2024, but that is something to note as well.

152
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,620
 I don't want to pick on, you know, anyone individual, but I've got to to provide my

153
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,060
 example and talking point.

154
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,800
 So Rukio, good map, fantastic work team.

155
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,320
 However, they put a lot of secrets and easter eggs into their map, and they were quite hidden,

156
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,960
 like more hidden than I think was reasonable, and therefore we didn't notice that they

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,320
 existed and found them confusing.

158
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,360
 There were a couple of bugs that prevented us from looking at those, but it was like,

159
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,580
 cool, there are easter eggs in here, but they weren't easy enough to find.

160
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,440
 Now I know mainstream games sometimes do that, like there's a side quest in Final Fantasy

161
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,560
 IX that took ten years to find.

162
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,240
 That's okay, because it's like a mainstream game, but when it comes to just a world or

163
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,000
 a session as a part of MMC, if you want those easter eggs to be part of your judging, please

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,320
 make them more obvious.

165
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,000
 We have so many entries to look at, and not enough time to look at all of them.

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,240
 So at a certain point, what I had to do in Rukio's entry was go, I know that there is

167
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,800
 more here, like I can see that something is meant to happen here, but I just unfortunately

168
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,360
 don't have time to discover it.

169
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,360
 There's something about like, if you made a certain drink, then something would appear,

170
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,100
 and if that thing appeared, you can then collect them, and then if you collected them, a new

171
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
 duck appeared.

172
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,560
 And the only reason I knew that, oh not duck, floaty appeared.

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,480
 And the only reason I knew that is because I saw something weird, and then I inspected

174
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,640
 it, and I was like "oh I see this", because I was then technically analysing the system.

175
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,080
 Oh, Jackal, thought, do you...

176
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,120
 So Jackal asks "how's the move, are other efforts going, do you think you'll be starting

177
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,320
 out tutorials again at some point?"

178
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,360
 I'm still incredibly busy with a variety of things that are non-neos related before

179
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,640
 anyone starts like Moveroo the rumour mill.

180
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,160
 I'm trying to get the move sorted, I have now applied for the apartment building, which

181
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,560
 is next to my apartment building.

182
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,960
 They needed income verification, which I provided, and for some reason that's gone all the way

183
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,000
 up to the regional manager of the company that owns the building, and she is not responding

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,040
 to her email, so that's fun.

185
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,280
 She needs to respond in the next couple of days or she'll lose a customer.

186
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,100
 She'll lose a customer with a very good credit score as well, so you know, she's losing out.

187
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,440
 Once that's sorted, then I can do things like arrange movers.

188
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,380
 I haven't got that much to move, but I am feeble and weak, I can't move a bed and a

189
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,120
 bookshelf by myself.

190
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,000
 And then I'll probably get a cleaner to do it once over here, because they charge you

191
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,440
 anyway, but if you get a cleaner to do it, then they don't have to do it.

192
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,640
 And they won't charge you, but you'll charge - it works out cheaper.

193
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,680
 "But you have requested a tutorial about the multi-UV material and what it's good for."

194
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,000
 I can give you an example straight off the top of my head.

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,400
 It really comes up a lot in avatar management and stuff like that.

196
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,780
 So let's imagine you have an avatar that has a scrolling emissive effect.

197
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,500
 I mean sometimes it's stars or sparkles or stuff like that.

198
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:44,340
 In some cases, you want elements to scroll differently over the UV than other elements.

199
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,180
 Like for example, you might want the star or the sparkle shape that's on your emissive

200
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,100
 map to scroll at a higher rate than something else.

201
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,400
 And the only real way to do that is to scroll those at different rates, which means different

202
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,680
 properties, which usually means different UVs.

203
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,620
 If you think about the UV for a face, that's sort of where you take the skin off someone's

204
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,420
 avatar and lay it down flat like some sort of weird mass murderer.

205
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,300
 That is one set of UVs, but then maybe another set of UVs is the stars or the twinkles that

206
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,680
 you need to scroll across their face.

207
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,880
 And that's why you'd use more UVs.

208
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 Separate those up.

209
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,520
 Yeah, good idea to use that.

210
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,160
 I have to look at my avatar and take a look at that.

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,840
 Inside of Blender, you can use as many UV maps as you want.

212
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,520
 And I know that a lot of people use those for things like baking and shadows and stuff

213
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,720
 like that.

214
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,800
 Lots of prep that I see for Substance Painter uses multi UV maps.

215
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,540
 There's stuff in Blender that I still don't know what it's for.

216
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,780
 And I'm just like, this looks cool, but I don't know what it's for.

217
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,500
 And the whole reason behind that is I don't do renders in Blender.

218
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,380
 I don't do any of the sort of animation in Blender.

219
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,820
 I don't even do particle systems or geometry.

220
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,380
 No, I haven't looked into that yet.

221
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,380
 I just like I have a character ID to like, you know, reweight paint their arm or something.

222
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,460
 Just I use it for like probably like a small part of its capabilities.

223
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,500
 Jack is commenting on the fact that they are starting up work on a new version of their

224
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,020
 MMC project, which is fantastic.

225
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,420
 They do comment that they were burnt out by MMC.

226
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,260
 The goal of MMC isn't to isn't to burn you out.

227
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,100
 So make sure that you are approaching it with your health in mind.

228
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,900
 Lex says one thing for them is that they're not going to work on multiple entries.

229
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
 That's a very good idea.

230
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,060
 For those who remember the NCC, which is the Neos contest, I made three entries.

231
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,220
 And the reason was because back then Neos was so small, I wanted there to be a wealth

232
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,460
 of entries.

233
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,460
 And I had a lot more time there because I wasn't on the team.

234
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,220
 So I made three entries.

235
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,540
 I wouldn't suggest doing that.

236
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,540
 There are no additional questions.

237
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,340
 I will scroll up the list, double check and I haven't missed any.

238
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,620
 I haven't missed any that I can see.

239
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,980
 How many additional questions do you let me know?

240
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,980
 I put them in that thread and I'll get them in the order that they have here.

241
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,780
 Lex asks would you know why accepting a contact request takes an indeterminate amount of time

242
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,120
 extra time for the person who's getting accepted?

243
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,820
 It's something to do with polling and caching as far as I'm aware.

244
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,740
 I know that's like a sort of like, what's the word I'm looking for?

245
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,220
 Lacklustre I guess we'll do for now.

246
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,460
 I know it's a lacklustre answer, but it's always that particular thing.

247
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,520
 I know that we want to expand our SignalR offerings such that that's faster and more

248
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,540
 immediate in the future.

249
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,420
 But you know, it is 4.24pm.

250
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,780
 We'll keep going for a little bit longer.

251
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
 But if you don't have any...

252
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,700
 Oh my god, that's a big question.

253
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,660
 So go ahead and get that done.

254
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
 Okay, cool.

255
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,420
 I've got some reading to do.

256
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,700
 So Jackal has a gigantic question which we're going to read.

257
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,620
 Vakrin, I have set up a simple round frame.

258
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,620
 I have to read it because otherwise it doesn't appear on the recording.

259
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,780
 I have set up a simple round frame that I'd like to be linked to my context menu.

260
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,580
 I've set up with the virtual parent component, an additional value copy board component so

261
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,740
 that I can drive its active state using the active state of the visual chart of the context

262
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,220
 menu slot attached to me and the player.

263
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,820
 Likewise, the override parent field is set to said visual slot.

264
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,180
 Let's set my frame's rotation scale and position using targets, virtual parent, and local settings

265
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,180
 to make it pretty.

266
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,540
 This works great, but only if every time I spawn I drag the visual slot into the override

267
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,420
 parent field of the virtual parent and the active i field name of the visual slot into

268
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,020
 the source of the value copy manually.

269
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,460
 I try to replicate these actions and logics if any miserably.

270
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,380
 The object has dark grey invalid markers all over when I respawn, and lately when I try

271
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,020
 to drive the active field, my object nears crashes entirely with an n-e-a-splosion in

272
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
 its locks.

273
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,220
 I'm having a difficult time getting consistent series of events though, so thank you for

274
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
 reading my book.

275
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
 I'll get to the question.

276
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,580
 How can I recreate those actions that I have to do manually using logics or components

277
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,700
 or some combination thereof so the frame object automatically sets itself up?

278
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,860
 If it's a timing issue where I have to put in some kind of delay, don't the rest of me

279
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,380
 load or any sub-hardwired or something zero?

280
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,380
 Okay, right.

281
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,500
 So in summary, they're trying to get a frame or a ring to appear in the same place as their

282
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,460
 context menu when they open it.

283
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,380
 Lots of people do that for visual aesthetics etc.

284
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,020
 Better not have a loud sound effect associated with it.

285
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,820
 It's just a visual, we're good.

286
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:18,340
 And they need to orchestrate a virtual parent component and a value copy component to copy

287
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,100
 those values around to make that work.

288
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,980
 You can absolutely do that.

289
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,580
 Good, good, no sound, no flashy lies to say.

290
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,660
 You can absolutely do that with logics.

291
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,380
 I would probably say, okay, Jack said that they suggested a solution to the problem,

292
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,500
 if you need help you can contact me in game, great, so that's the solution.

293
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,020
 You can absolutely do that with logic.

294
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,940
 You'll probably have to use things like the slot finding nodes or the slot descending

295
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,440
 nodes, you know, like get child, get child, etc. to descend down to find the slot that

296
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,940
 you're after.

297
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,600
 Once you have a slot reference, you can get that active property from that slot with get

298
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,940
 slot is active, etc. inside logics.

299
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,980
 You can also write slot references to virtual parent, etc.

300
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,620
 That should all work fine.

301
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,740
 You may need a delay though.

302
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,380
 Here's the sort of rule of thumb that usually works is stick an update delay of two in there.

303
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,660
 I don't know why two works well, I just always use two.

304
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,660
 Sometimes two doesn't work.

305
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:22,260
 I know if you could say something about dynamic variables and that requires six, but yeah,

306
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,820
 stick an update delay of two and it should work.

307
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:31,300
 It should totally be available to do using a variety of logics.

308
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,820
 Update delay is a node.

309
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
 Update delay is a node.

310
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,300
 Update order you shouldn't really need to touch.

311
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,740
 There's lots of things where I add the two, update delay two, that I don't really know

312
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,780
 why I just have to.

313
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,900
 As with the updating relay and similar things like that, try adding those things and then

314
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,860
 if it does work, great.

315
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,660
 But if it doesn't work, do you remember to re-remove those because then you're not consistently

316
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,780
 adding bloat that you don't know why it's there.

317
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,780
 I do that every time.

318
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,300
 Like I get some like logic just won't work.

319
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,380
 I start adding random update delays, it works.

320
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,100
 I start removing update delays until it doesn't work again and I know exactly where the problem

321
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
 is occurring.

322
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,940
 It's basically like an order of operations thing.

323
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,420
 Like if logics is faster than some non-logics process or vice versa, then stuff won't line

324
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,420
 up sometimes.

325
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,100
 Particularly in avatar spawning, which sounds like the problem that you're describing.

326
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,260
 Jack says, "Would you be interested in perhaps throwing together an official NES calendar

327
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,020
 once I have the thing improved?"

328
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
 You mean an in-game calendar?

329
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
 Yeah, sure.

330
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,540
 And we want to get the event system set up on this Discord here.

331
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,540
 I don't remember the exact reason why we don't have it here.

332
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,820
 We want to get that sorted.

333
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,260
 I also want to get a calendar sorted that is on our website ideally.

334
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,940
 I would love if we could have like more social style stuff on our website.

335
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,980
 I always talk about it, but it kind of doesn't make sense anymore.

336
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,500
 Like the AltSpaceVR event calendar was amazing.

337
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,540
 It was basically, you know, you want to host an event where it's just you playing a guitar

338
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,540
 in a fire, like a round of fire based map.

339
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,540
 You know what I mean?

340
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,860
 Campfire, that's the word I was looking for.

341
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,960
 Round of campfire on a map like that, you can just post that to the AltSpaceVR webpage

342
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,200
 and people can come.

343
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,620
 You want to do a special interest group?

344
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:15,620
 We saw everything on that list from religion to politics to support groups, etc.

345
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
 It was great.

346
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,060
 Unfortunately, Microsoft has pulled the plug on AltSpaceVR.

347
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,100
 I don't know how far along they are in pulling the plugs, it might exist, but I'd love to

348
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,360
 get that on the website at some point.

349
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 And in game.

350
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,740
 We have like a community tab on the dash, that would be amazing.

351
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,580
 But starting in five minutes, Jack plays the trombone.

352
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,260
 I don't know if he can play the trombone, I just thought the first instrument that popped

353
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,500
 into my head.

354
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 Next question.

355
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,420
 Second, says "Do you know of any changes that may have happened to make LNL more unreliable,

356
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
 more desynchial of later?

357
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,540
 Is it like an external factor like international peering that's just going downhill?"

358
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,220
 There have been no changes to those things as of late.

359
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,060
 Cloudflare would have not affected those, because that's a socket channel which would

360
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
 not go via Cloudflare.

361
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,140
 No changes I can think of.

362
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,840
 International peering might be a culprit.

363
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,360
 I am so happy that someone so far away knows what international peering is, thank you so

364
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,180
 much for knowing that phrasing.

365
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,660
 So many people don't understand how crazy the internet is, so I'm glad you know that

366
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,660
 term.

367
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,100
 Raid, I can never pronounce your name, I'm sorry, I've seen your pronunciation guide,

368
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,180
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

369
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,860
 Do slots load in a consistent order at all is the way to manipulate order slots load

370
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
 in.

371
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,480
 Not that I'm aware of, although try the update order.

372
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,900
 That does affect things like aligners, UIX, and things like that, so it might affect load,

373
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
 I'm not certain.

374
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,620
 Yeah, the internet is just crazy.

375
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,660
 Stop using super reactions, guys, don't those cost like, you can only do like five of those

376
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,220
 a month or something.

377
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,980
 Five a day, oh that's fine, yeah, five a day, I thought it was five a month, I've never

378
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,580
 used them because I thought it was five a month.

379
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,980
 It's like when you play a video game and like, you know, some quest giver will be like "thank

380
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,700
 you for savoring the forest, here's this like potion that will make you super awesome",

381
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,300
 but you never drink it, because you're never like "oh I might need it for like, I might

382
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,860
 need it for like", you get to the credits and you're just like "never drank that super

383
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,620
 awesome potion, never drank that super awesome potion".

384
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:17,860
 Per week, it's per week, that's still bad, okay, thank you, I go.

385
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,020
 Anyway, we will leave off there, if you have any additional questions please feel free to
