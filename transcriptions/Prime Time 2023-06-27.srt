00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Welcome to office hours if you have a question, please go ahead and drop it in the office hours text chat

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,800
 There's a couple channels above this one that we're currently in

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:12,200
 And we'll get them answered in the order that they appear. We have a question flooding in so fantastic. We'll get to it right away

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,840
 So Tiki asks, I know an empty world takes around 20 megabytes. I have a custom world that uses 1.6

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:29,920
 6 6 giga giga biggie, but good boo 1 6 gigabytes 1 point try again 1.66 gigabytes the usage report only shows the world as one big blob

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,760
 How can I understand what is taking space in the world? Um

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,800
 Take a look in the world and maybe try saving parts of it separately to see how big those are

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,800
 Do you remember that the file space?

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,080
 Reporting isn't entirely accurate in some cases. So

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,440
 an empty world probably won't take 20 megabytes because

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,120
 It's most the assets that are everywhere. So they don't really

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,800
 meet your

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,560
 Your quota as for the world that is taking 1.6 6

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,040
 Yeah, save different parts of the world. See if there's anything large in there

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,480
 Make sure you've got the clean up unused assets thing of a Bob turned on you can also do that from the asset clean up

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
 Was it to try and clean that up?

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,800
 Look through all the slots make sure that there's this stuff there if need be and I only say this like

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,680
 I only do this like when I really really need to actually also look in the assets folder

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,320
 You shouldn't really go in there too much, but you can mess stuff up by just you know doing incorrect stuff in there

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,120
 But take a look inside the assets folder make sure there's nothing in there that for some reason isn't being cleaned up

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,800
 Keep an eye your textures and materials there

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:41,040
 It's surprising how many sort of of the CC zero materials as well are to offer K and then they really don't need to be

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,400
 So maybe it's that

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
 moving forward to

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Lex question asks

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,280
 What's a good way of presenting educational content?

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,560
 In this case complex geometry to the nearest community in a way that makes sense to most people or at least intrigued

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,280
 You mean like mathematically complex geometry. I like the walls and experiences which like let people play with it

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,280
 so a good example would be the

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,240
 The

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,280
 Neural network world that was produced for M.C. I believe it's 22

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,120
 By a team that involved orange

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,240
 I don't remember who is on the like entire team there

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,640
 But they gave you sort of a history of AI and then they let you play with a very simple artificial intelligence that can play pong

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,000
 And they let you play with it in a way where you can like you can interact with it

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,280
 There's also a few worlds by me where I sort of lay out stuff in a way that can be played with

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,760
 If anyone that's hung out with me enough you probably seen some of my mathematical things where I've sort of started trying to build a sort

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,760
 of Museum of Maths with having different

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,440
 educational ways of showing content

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,600
 As a help to that I want to

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,760
 Link this again. I think I linked it in a previous office hours

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,800
 I just pushed a weird button and Chrome did a weird thing. I've never seen it do before. Okay, strange

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,760
 I

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,720
 understood I said Pythagoras as a kid with a humongous amount of explanation and understanding right traditional stuff

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,960
 But the video that I just linked gives people

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:18,200
 Something that you can play with like I've seen a similar setup in a variety of museums etc that allows people to just like play

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,320
 With what's going on and see what happens the context actually does help so

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,120
 Lex is talking about the monotile

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,640
 That was discovered by someone completely unexpected wasn't it?

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,280
 I can't remember and I don't really have a chance to sort of read through this but it's a

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,380
 Tile that when you use the pattern will never repeat

52
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,360
 Something on that it's like really complicated

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,260
 Yeah, make a world or a symbol or a sorry not a world or a tool

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,000
 That's what I mean not simple make a world or a tool where people can play with the mathematics of that to see what's happening

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 all right moving forwards to

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 a

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,080
 Cloud pandas question in expansion to Tiki's question. I have a 2.6 ish gigabyte

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,720
 I know I have 2.6 ish gigabytes used out of 3 gigabytes for my cloud storage

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,000
 I don't quite know is eating up all that storage

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,120
 I have some worlds and some avatars and shouldn't take up my much storage as it is

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,720
 What do you recommend doing to remedy that make sure you do the usage report that will show you what's going on there?

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,440
 Keep an eye on things like videos textures etc those do mount up quickly particularly if there are four or eight K textures moving forward to

63
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,020
 How do I do this report thing is I'll jump ahead to look out who says how do I do the report thing?

64
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,280
 You can find that command on

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,720
 The wiki I'll get you a link in just a second

66
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,080
 Hey, there's a link to that so it's near spot storage commands on the NES wiki will show you how to do that

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,200
 moving forwards to exos

68
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,120
 Question X that we could ask with the tail root virus being dealt with how long should we have there is protections in our worlds

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,480
 I know how to answer that because we still have the protections in the world for the previous instance of something similar to that

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 In the actual code base, so I don't really know how to answer the question to that

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,260
 the problem that occurs is let's say it's a year or two down the line and

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,320
 Someone spawns into your world and for whatever reason they need to refer to where take a look at spawn

73
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,760
 Whatever the hell you want

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,820
 An item that has that element on it it will reinfect the population

75
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,000
 In particular if any saving is going on

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,080
 I don't really know how to answer that one

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,540
 In that regard then it'd be interesting if someone made like a detector and cleaner

78
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,520
 that

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,640
 kept data tracking somehow make sure you're following the guidelines of course on this but like let's say you had a detector that

80
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,680
 Like just tapped some sort of web endpoint on the shoulder every time it found one to clean up

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,740
 You could then graph those over time should do that anonymously as well

82
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,880
 There's no need to know who it was or whatever just like I found one web server

83
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,040
 I found one the web server goes got it and

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,200
 Then you could graph that over time and and and when that tails off down to like zero

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,020
 You'd be like, okay, it's probably safe to do it now. It's interesting though because if you look at the

86
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,700
 cases of things like smallpox or

87
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,720
 What's the one no smallpox has been eradicated many? I don't know how because it's very difficult but

88
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,240
 Polio that's the one if you look at polio

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,920
 It looks like it's been eradicated but hasn't occasionally there's a spike in polio cases

90
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,600
 So that's why you're still vaccinated against it as a kid or issue are in the UK. Um, I think it says people might get annoyed

91
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,080
 By HTTP dialogue just for it

92
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,240
 If you're the world host no do it as the world host if it's a popular headless as well

93
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,160
 You can do it as the headless host and then you could do double check the guidelines there because it's anonymized

94
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,200
 It's basically like I found this not where it was found. It would be okay

95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,560
 I think it's just you know, the detection logic found a case of it

96
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,240
 Tap a web address. I think that's all the questions we have. So I'm gonna scroll up and down

97
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
 I haven't missed any I have not

98
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,060
 Do assist or other loop? What does the tail root virus do?

99
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:20,840
 It self propagates itself into various systems behinds in avatars tail roots. It's tail root virus and

100
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,280
 It will when it gets attached to a user it will emulate stick drift. It is quite

101
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,840
 Malignant in the way that it hides

102
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,400
 so even if you weren't working on avatars, you might find it inside the world there are various detection systems and

103
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,240
 Removers that you can find and use I would recommend running them on anything you have saved recently

104
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,180
 I would also recommend for the mean time

105
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:52,000
 Unfortunately for the mean time that if you're saving an avatar you do it in a private world. I know that's problematic

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,860
 You know or you have a detection system where an alarm goes off when when one is found

107
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,080
 Because when one instance of it is found, they'll be surely more common and truly really annoying and not that I want to like, you know

108
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,040
 Rant on ahead about this more

109
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,640
 But if you're in a public world and you're editing your avatar like maybe don't like build something cool build an experience

110
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,480
 Build something that reaches out touches me and says I exist

111
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,880
 I am a cool experience because then at least it's you know, it's right into that experience. There are no

112
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,200
 Sorry, excuse me. There are no additional questions. Just make sure you get those questions in and on some the order appear

113
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
 Otherwise we'll sit here in silence

114
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,360
 Hope everyone's day is going

115
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,720
 fantastic

116
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,440
 Tabbing around back to the chat

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,640
 Jackal asked have I missed an update to how your move is going whether you settled in yet the move is at the end of the

118
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,200
 Week I go on about a lot because I find moving really stressful. But yeah, I see that at the week

119
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,320
 An update there is I'm amazed how much you can pack whilst maintaining functionality of an apartment

120
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,720
 I mean by that is I have a ton of boxes packed

121
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,640
 But I can still you know, drink water make tea use the bathroom like everything in there. Not just the toilet, you know like showering

122
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
 washing hands everything in the bathroom

123
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,440
 Perfectly fine in there. My computer still works VR still works

124
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,920
 I am down to base stations though because they're in the way

125
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,560
 So I took those down bookshelves completely empty, but I'm still sat here talking to you guys office hours

126
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,740
 I know it'll be like a real move when I start losing functionality

127
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,360
 So, you know when I can't sleep in the bed or I can't make food or whatever

128
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,680
 Link asked how a runescape is going

129
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,960
 We'll go there until if a Neos question appears we will abruptly stop because this is a Neos

130
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,840
 See, okay. We're gonna stop immediately. We've got a Neos question. Never mind. No runescape

131
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
 I'm actually happy about that

132
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,720
 Tiki asked when optimizing a world for performance. What's the best to start with between lighting materials and colliders?

133
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,400
 Start with materials because

134
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,480
 That will affect the world

135
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,920
 The most but I'm trying to basically do is when you optimize stuff you want to preserve the original intention of the world

136
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,080
 So if you have sort of like I don't know I always go to this art example

137
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,440
 I don't know why someone make this like a moody

138
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,040
 Backwater sort of you know

139
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,240
 dive bar in like a you know, very quiet dark street like, you know

140
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,280
 You still want that atmosphere to be there?

141
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,620
 And so if you're optimizing and somehow you lose that because of optimization that's like the wrong way to optimize. So

142
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:48,480
 Start with materials and lighting do colliders last because colliders shouldn't affect the visual and functional parts of the world

143
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,760
 they just affect performance, but if you don't start with materials and lighting and you're

144
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,480
 You might end up with a point where it's like oh, I've optimized everything else about this world, but this material is like wrong

145
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
 So I got to swap it out now

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,380
 I don't know the bar counters a different type of wood or whatever and I have ruined the whole aesthetic that I was going

147
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,220
 I was going for if you do materials then lighting

148
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,400
 It means you don't get into the point where like oh this materials now too light because like I you know

149
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,220
 There's now light on it. I know it's too light. I'm gonna make it dark

150
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,520
 It's just like, you know, I also consider what people use in the world

151
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,320
 I've seen a common thing in VR chat for example is like every single goddamn world has the pool set up

152
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,340
 You know, you can play pool the game not a pool is in swimming pool that with the snooker but baby snooker

153
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,220
 That's what some people call pool

154
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,640
 Every single world in VR chat has udod pool and it's not used. It's just not used

155
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,820
 So just don't put it in the world

156
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,120
 Or consider not putting it in the world

157
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,340
 And again, that'll be a lot more optimization because remember that each of those those balls

158
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:59,540
 Has a texture and if there are too many balls, there's too many textures and then there's too many materials. I mean

159
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,800
 Hopefully those balls are atlased into one

160
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,580
 Material but it is VR chat

161
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:13,400
 Think it says VR chat has texture streaming though on like us. We have file streaming right when you load into a world

162
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,020
 And stuff but you know, do you need balls in your world?

163
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:24,260
 No, particularly with Neos where like if someone wanted to play the lirds pool, whatever

164
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,000
 They could spawn out a table and just plop it down in the middle

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,720
 I think I said sometimes Neos client doesn't even load from cash

166
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,500
 It's really downloads them from the cows point having cash it downloads from the cash from the cloud when it senses that it needs to

167
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,820
 for whatever logic that it might have if that logic is broken or

168
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,120
 problematic

169
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
 Then it's probably a bug that we need to fix

170
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,520
 So I'm noticing a lack of questions. So let's go back up to runescape. Oh, no, here we go. We got a question

171
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,520
 This is great thread to talk about runescape and people post Neos questions. This is amazing

172
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:07,020
 Tiki asks in continuation the question. How about of a hit on performance do very complex mesh colliders all around the world do

173
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,680
 Mesh colliders are bad on high poly things

174
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,800
 Where you are colliding with them a lot or in differing ways

175
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,900
 Example here might be let's say you have a mesh collider. That's just a square right? It's floor. It's floor. So it's a square

176
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,640
 that's okay, right because the poly count should be low, but now let's say that the

177
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,480
 It's not like regular for its terrain. Okay, that's a little bit worse because the train is a bunch of sort of

178
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,160
 meandering triangles that make the sort of bumps and the valleys and the hills in

179
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,840
 In the terrain now, let's go up to that if it's the $8 chicken nugget touching that or walking on that is very painful

180
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,080
 would not suggest

181
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,600
 Beyond that if the mesh collider is active you're gonna die

182
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,120
 a good way to remember this is that if it's not a mesh collider and if it's not a

183
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120
 I'm just putting convex cull colliders in a different category

184
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
 Those are more efficient than mesh colliders

185
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,520
 But just putting them in a different category just for now if it's a primitive collider that is not a convex hull collider

186
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,800
 The mathematics for determining whether you are colliding for it with a very simple because they're volume based

187
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,680
 It's are you inside the volume of this collider, which is very easy mathematically with convex hull

188
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,000
 There's different maps. I don't quite understand but with mesh colliders

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,760
 It's are you inside every single triangle of this mesh and it does it on a triangle level?

190
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,440
 Because right it doesn't know what the structure of the mesh is. It has to sort of test every triangle

191
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,680
 So if your mesh has a hundred K triangles, that's a hundred K tests if your mesh has one triangle

192
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,280
 That's one test hence why floor is okay. Because if a floor is just a square then it should just be two triangles

193
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,360
 Unless yeah fusion 360 makes it a lot

194
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,740
 I've noticed the architectural tools and 3d printing tools

195
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,860
 Make more complex geometry because they need that level of detail because they're going to a CNC machine

196
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,660
 They're going to a CAD machine. They're going to a 3d printer. They need that detail

197
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,900
 so it doesn't really apply to architectural or

198
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,340
 printy things

199
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,340
 Think you asked what's the weird collider have a ha ha ha ha go to 2.0 thing

200
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,660
 That is a HVAC or HCAV. I can't remember which way around it is

201
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,280
 Mesh decomposition. I have a video on that on my channel

202
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,100
 More people should use it

203
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,260
 Additionally, there is someone who in the comments sort of mentioned how they use it which completely

204
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:43,560
 Completely destroys the point of using it. So try not to do that, but I'll link the video in just a second

205
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,660
 I talked about the simplicity of that

206
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,300
 Here as well

207
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:56,540
 In the video I talked about how a cat actually the cat pitched in the thumbnail there convex hold decomposes very well

208
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,340
 But how the convex hold decomposition for the chicken nugget isn't that good?

209
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,980
 But then I also talked about how for the this conference table in the middle of the world during that tutorial

210
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
 there's no real need to update the

211
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,280
 The collision meshes for that conference room table. It's very low poly

212
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,620
 there's also a version of that cat in my meme folder where I've selectively removed a few of the convex holes and

213
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,560
 Texture the convex holes is bread. So it looks like the cat is sort of embedded in bread. It is very good

214
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,720
 I couldn't tell you how it works though. There's like if you like click the help icon, it's like yeah if you change the theta

215
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,520
 Number it does like magical blah blah blah. It's like, okay great. I have no idea what that means

216
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,260
 There's also the lucca lucca cat and then the meme folder that one doesn't work as well

217
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,940
 I want to rewrite it

218
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:49,340
 But my meme folder is just a journey through insanity like where else like memes in popular culture are things which are very widely known

219
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,340
 My meme folder is stuff that it's very wildly known to me

220
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:59,720
 But no one else everyone's going through it and they're just like what the hell is going on. It's like, I don't know

221
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,680
 Okay, we're gonna try and go back to RuneScape. Okay, this means more Nios questions. This is amazing. I love this. I love this

222
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:14,040
 So RuneScape had a bunch of promotions stacked on top of each other which are really frustrating me right now

223
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,420
 Because it means I can't do what I'm trying to do which is get to 95 divination

224
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,640
 But so first of all, they had this event called the golden cape event and that you had to do like a bunch of just crazy

225
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,400
 Stuff to get golden cape shards eight golden cape shards made you a golden cape

226
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,740
 The golden cape is going for like 13 million gold right now

227
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,480
 So like I was doing it for the money

228
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,080
 But it turns out that the golden cape gets you a buff for 30 days

229
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,160
 Which means any gathering that you do immediately teleports to your bank

230
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,080
 So if you're mining rather than it going into your inventory it teleports to your bank

231
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,600
 So when that started I then had to spend basically 30 days making use of that

232
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,700
 So I decided to train mining because mining is very simple

233
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,700
 There are other gathering skills like wood cutting but sometimes a tree doesn't respawn

234
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,180
 So you have to like walk around and click a different tree or find another tree

235
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:09,360
 But for mining you stand in one spot and you just periodically have to click the rocks and it will continue mining

236
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,860
 And so I got mining from like level 59 all the way to 91 in those 30 days

237
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,680
 And there's still six days left and I've progressed through the ores

238
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:25,940
 So much so that every time I now hear the mining sound I'm making 4k because I'm mining top-level ore

239
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,060
 Like I hear like quack

240
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:34,500
 It's 4k, quack 4k, quack 4k and it immediately goes to my bank. So it's really profitable

241
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,520
 But during that they also had a beach event where you had to go to a beach and do a bunch of beach events

242
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,140
 Beach events were great exp apparently, but I didn't really do them

243
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,440
 There was also sandy clue scrolls now sandy clue scrolls are different from regular clue scrolls in that they are

244
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,380
 Themed for the beach and given to you by a lady called sandy

245
00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:00,400
 Now the best way to do sandy clue scrolls is a like little tip for next time the beach happens maybe

246
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,860
 Do it

247
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:08,240
 RuneScape themed office hours at another time is if you collect the sandy clue scrolls on a non-members world

248
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,780
 The pool of clues that they they pull from is much smaller

249
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,500
 So swap to a non-members world do the clue scrolls there if the clue scroll tells you to go to somewhere that is not on

250
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,480
 The beach destroy the clue scroll get a new clue scroll and it will be on the beach and you just keep doing that

251
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,160
 so sometimes the clue is like travel across the lands to the top of the mountain and pray to

252
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,960
 Jesus or something you just destroy the clue scroll pick up a new one

253
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,240
 It says talk to the lady with the coconuts and then you can get it

254
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,140
 But once you've completed the clue scroll and you've got the chest that you get at the end of the clue scroll

255
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,420
 You have to swap back to a members world to open it. Otherwise, you'll get non-member rewards swapping that - wow, I'm hungry

256
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:58,000
 I'll get some food off this swapping back to Nios because we have a question see how this works is great

257
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,220
 is there any documentation on the number pad key binds on the

258
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,720
 Camera and 360 camera launch modes for Nios there are not I didn't know that they had number pad key points

259
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,500
 Used to be is no no no news on that

260
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,200
 I'll have to add that to my documentation list which is like huge. We are now at half past so

261
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,980
 Our final bit on runescape then once the beach ended they added this last wills event lost wills event

262
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,620
 And that's where like when you do random activities you gain wills and you exchange wills to a skeleton man

263
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:40,720
 And he gives you chests and you open those chests and you get random rewards because I've been mining during that I have like

264
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,460
 5,000 of these lost wills like every couple of days I go in there and I just get so much junk

265
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,360
 I've got like

266
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,580
 Seven or eight rings that make me look like a zombie and they don't they can't sell them or trade them

267
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,440
 But I've got seven of them and it's just like why am I getting duplicates? Why?

268
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,620
 Anyway, we will leave off there as there are no additional questions, and this is not a runescape of ourselves

269
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,380
 So I'm gonna go ahead and call it there. I will speak to you guys to next week where I will be

270
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:14,420
 Where I will be in the new place. I just processed the audio for last week's

271
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,240
 I would endeavor to process the audio for this week's now

272
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,980
 I do need to do some more packing so that that will be where I don't need to use my computer

273
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,120
 It does slow down the computer a lot and then I'll get that all sorted Lex understood

274
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
 I'll try and get to those to you as soon as I can

275
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,620
 Apologies for the delay there. I am quite busy trying not to die with my boxes. I will speak to you guys later
