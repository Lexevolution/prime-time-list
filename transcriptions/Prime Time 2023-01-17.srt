1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
 Welcome to office hours, it's the top of the hour so we'll go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,360
 This is the half hour-ish segment where I talk about Neos and get Neos questions answered

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,360
 that you may have.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,460
 If you have a question please drop in the prime time questions for the day's date up

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,640
 in the office hours text chat.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,400
 There's a few channels about this one, you'll be able to find it.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,680
 I'm going to go ahead and ping the office hours group again so people know that it's

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,700
 starting and then we can go ahead and get going on any questions that we have.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,700
 Right now we have none so if you want questions answered get them typed into that thread.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,520
 As a reminder with a lack of questions we just sit here and we talk about nothing a

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
 bit different etc.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,440
 Alright there we go, a question here from Stella who says "How do you feel MMC is going

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,020
 to go this year, size and world complexity wise?"

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,280
 I'm not quite sure, it's been a little bit of a while since we did one, it was last February,

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,960
 we moved it from October to February so it was better for sort of an international market.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,760
 There's not much changes in terms of sort of rules and categories so the same freedom

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,660
 that we had is still there.

18
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,380
 So we'll just have to see what happens.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,140
 I'm hoping that we have a comparable amount of entries, although it might be more, if

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,700
 it's more that's great, if it's the same that's great, if it's slightly less that's great.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,700
 I'm not fussed.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,920
 Soap says "Have you had your daily dose of cheese today?"

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
 I have not.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,660
 I did go grocery shopping though.

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,840
 I had a bunch of errands to do, I had to go to the post office and I had to go grocery

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,300
 shopping and then I got back and I'm like "Wow that was exhausting" and I fell asleep

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,860
 on the couch forever so I'm here, hello.

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,580
 Jekyll Girl says "Are you going to be building anything for MMC?"

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,200
 I actually do chuck in an entry in, my actual entry for MMC every year is actually the voting

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,700
 system that's used to allow you to vote on entries though so that will for sure be built.

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,260
 Rampa says "Better for international market unless you have an exam period going straight

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
 over at prime."

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,180
 Well there's a problem here which is that we can't please everyone and sometimes it

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,500
 feels like people are trying to ask us to do that and it's just not possible.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,980
 We figured out that by making it in February, last year we had a little bit of a weird one

36
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,300
 where we did it in October and then February so you know it was a bit like "This again?

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
 We've only just finished it!"

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,260
 But now we're locked to February February February February, it should be good and it's

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,500
 better for the international market overall.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,020
 The greater good needs to come up.

41
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,380
 Sorry that you have exams during it but the rest of the world has other stuff elsewhere.

42
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,740
 Specs is talking about squeezing time in with their full time job etc as a reminder which

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,420
 we remind people every single year, don't overdo it.

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,860
 You have the ability to plan ahead, reduce scope, don't submit your world within the

45
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,180
 last five minutes of the competition.

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,540
 People will do it, at least one person in here will do it but please don't, you know,

47
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
 plan ahead.

48
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,500
 I know, Specs, their team is about overdoing it but you know, I also say it every year

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:01,500
 as well, practice publishing a world, saving a world, managing a world, creating a world.

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,180
 Don't make the first world that you publish, the first world that you save, the first world

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,900
 that you create your entry.

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,140
 You may come across issues that you don't expect to happen if you've never done it before.

53
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,140
 Also did you know that you can publish your entry and then continue working on it?

54
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,700
 So let's say it gets to the last week and you're still making polishing changes, publish

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,860
 the entry and then continue working on it.

56
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,420
 That way you don't have to panic, right?

57
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,660
 You just have to make sure that the world continues to function roughly.

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,220
 For example if you're tweaking visuals towards the end in that last week, it can be published,

59
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,300
 you're just tweaking visuals.

60
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,380
 If you're just swapping out some textures or whatever or maybe some colours, publish

61
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,380
 it!

62
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,380
 There's no reason for it not to be published.

63
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,380
 It's not like it's going to get a bad judgement just for being published early, it'll probably

64
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,740
 get a better one because you've managed to publish it without stress.

65
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,100
 Moving onwards we have a question here from Ozi who says "In a recent build I've been

66
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,380
 trying to use completely local variables to do this, a value copy on a value register

67
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,780
 the same one you spawn at Viologics with writeback.

68
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,540
 Is this fine to do or is there anything I should worry about pathability update wise?"

69
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,300
 Not quite sure, that's like, I don't understand the value copy.

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,940
 For local variables just use a value user override with create override on write on

71
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,580
 like a value field or something, that'll probably be a better idea.

72
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,780
 Probably also work on a value register but I don't know why the value copy comes in.

73
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,820
 Oh don't value copy itself, just values override.

74
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,480
 Mr Damon asks "Very broad question but how do you feel about the future of Neos?

75
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,860
 It will continue forwards until the heat death of the universe so there's lots of future."

76
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,500
 Uh, don't, don't do that.

77
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,580
 I don't really have a reason to tell you not to do it other than don't.

78
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,180
 I'd have to look into why there but I just have a visceral reaction when looking at that

79
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,940
 image to say don't.

80
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:58,460
 Yeah I hear lots of advice from people that really isn't researched or validated or tested

81
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,900
 in any way, they just discover some sort of hacky thing that's going on and then it spreads

82
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,420
 by word of mouth and at no point do people think "hmm I should maybe research exactly

83
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
 what's going on here."

84
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,820
 I would have to look into a lot of the data model code to figure out what's going on there.

85
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,340
 It shouldn't be possible to do that.

86
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,340
 For example there's a thing here like there is no networking.

87
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
 Have you tested that?

88
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,100
 Have you opened a world of two people in it and default avatars and created I don't know

89
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,580
 like 20 of those and sent it around.

90
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,700
 Leo asks how would you go about creating better debugging tools?

91
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,060
 It depends what you're trying to debug.

92
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,940
 There is the debug menu that not enough people use really.

93
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,740
 It's difficult to sort of isolate what's going on there particularly when your avatars are

94
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,300
 complex or you know crazy.

95
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,660
 Hence why I say try the default avatar or try you know an avatar made entirely out of

96
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:59,140
 frames or like a single mesh and then try your world or your creation and see what's going on.

97
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,980
 There's also that thing where if you spawn out like 10 copies of your avatar you can

98
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:08,060
 sort of see what the performance is at scale with other people have avatars.

99
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,820
 Beyond that we don't really have the suitable debugging tools to give you right now.

100
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,140
 It will probably be an initiative that we have at some point once we've got some more

101
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,500
 features under our belt.

102
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,780
 I also get bothered when people are doing weird things like the above just because they're

103
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,380
 like there's no networking.

104
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,540
 It doesn't it's a single float.

105
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,900
 It's not going to cause much networking load right.

106
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,460
 There are hundreds of floats just for like an avatar existing in the world that are sort

107
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,380
 of like ping ponging around.

108
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,380
 Optimize better.

109
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,620
 If you want a local variable then you know you should network sync the parameters and

110
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,260
 then drive the result and then you minimize network traffic that way.

111
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,500
 Who says is there a way to see what types Bool user component field accepts?

112
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,340
 There is a little hack I sometimes do for that.

113
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,180
 There are some mods to do it you know more effectively of course.

114
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,380
 But what I do is I grab a logic interface card for the component and then if you pull

115
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,100
 a ribbon out of any of the properties on that component and push secondary it will sometimes

116
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:18,500
 glitch out and just create a blank sort of dark blue dark purple ref arrow and then you

117
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,900
 can look at that ref arrow with your logic step and it will tell you the data type that

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,060
 it's expecting usually surrounded with other weird stuff etc.

119
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:33,340
 It's usually only reference types that you will have an issue there with because reference

120
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,820
 types are less clear.

121
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,380
 If it's a basic value such as Bool then the colors match up to our standard coloring and

122
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,820
 that secondary tip won't help.

123
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,940
 The get type node is also a good suggestion there so keep that one in mind.

124
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
 Do you expand on that question?

125
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,940
 If I'd like to see runtime performance at a per slot level like a color coded heat map

126
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
 results?

127
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,740
 I would too but I also wouldn't because people would use that to judge people so we'd have

128
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,660
 to sort of see how we can do that effectively.

129
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
 We already get that.

130
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,100
 It's like you have 101 slots the limit on avatars for this world is 100 slots.

131
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
 It's like guys grow up please.

132
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,220
 Yeah exactly exactly what Lex says.

133
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:23,620
 He can fill 100 slots with access aligners and they will have humongous performance implications

134
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:31,620
 compared to I don't know an avatar that has 101 slots or 200 slots or 500 slots and it's

135
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,980
 just you know an avatar existing in the world.

136
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,500
 Clots are the last thing you should look at for performance reasons.

137
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,780
 Start with what it does and also examine why it does it.

138
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,500
 A good example which I always go for and I don't know if it's just me being British or

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,900
 something is why do like loads of people just have guns on their avatar?

140
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,860
 Do you need to have a gun on your avatar?

141
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,700
 Are you going to shoot people?

142
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,060
 Like why are you going to shoot people?

143
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,000
 If you need a gun spawn a gun.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,700
 You don't need a gun on your avatar.

145
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,580
 You know what McCree or whatever his name is from Overwatch who has a gun like that

146
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,660
 or any of the other characters that I've ever got I realise but you know McCree has one

147
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,140
 and Holsters is what I meant.

148
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,620
 I was talking about Holsters.

149
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,020
 Anyway point being I don't need it.

150
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:19,420
 Does your context menu need to play the Halo theme tune orchestral chorus thingy opera

151
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,220
 version when you open your context menu?

152
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,900
 No so that's a better way to optimise your avatar than worrying about slots.

153
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:34,540
 Ozzy has a fun one who says do you know how to or point to how to go about slot sorting

154
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,100
 try making racing god have say first second third place using slot order offset.

155
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,940
 Order offsets are good but you need to make sure that you're actually setting them.

156
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,740
 Sometimes in UI I've built I've relied on the fact that new slots will occur after previous

157
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,660
 slots and that has screwed up when the gadget or the utility has then reloaded because when

158
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,020
 it reloads it's sort of not random but sort of indeterminate what ones might load first

159
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,420
 so sometimes they get out of order.

160
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,820
 So as long as you're setting that slot order offset on creation when you drop it into like

161
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,800
 a collection of slots then it should be okay particularly if you're using UIX which plays

162
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,820
 attention more to that.

163
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:24,700
 If you're still having issues with that you can also do it mathematically and in mathematical

164
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:31,080
 sense you'll have to adjust rect transforms or the positioning of individual rect transforms

165
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,060
 to make them in the order that you want which would be hilariously bad.

166
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,200
 Stella asks is there any way to write driver nullable value?

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,940
 You can write it yes I'm not sure about driving but absolutely oh no you can drive it as well

168
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
 yeah sure.

169
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,940
 You're looking for the nullable nodes once you have the nullable nodes you'll have the

170
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,820
 ability to drive and write them.

171
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,160
 I think I have a video on the nullable nodes do I not?

172
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,580
 I will have a video on the nullable nodes very shortly because that's a really easy

173
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,860
 one to do.

174
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,420
 I can't remember which folder of the Logix browser they're in but there we go actually

175
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,620
 Lex found it for me so operators nullable use those nodes they are pretty self-explanatory

176
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,340
 but I have just added onto my to-do list a task to go ahead and make a video on that

177
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,500
 one because it's really simple once you know Eden and thank you for the example as well

178
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,840
 I probably haven't done a video before because I can never remember where nullable show up

179
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,840
 but the the near and far clip is a good example.

180
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,160
 Skant talks about the horrible Logix from before that said would this be the component

181
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,780
 equivalent of log of using Logix to drive itself quite possibly yes internally value

182
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,880
 copy and the drive system use the same sort of code internally there's just like a piece

183
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,500
 it's not exactly this but there's a piece of code which is like you know drive this

184
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,080
 field by this field and value copy operates on that but sets up some other settings for

185
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,840
 various reasons so yeah pretty much.

186
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,920
 Hanu says what causes the lag spike and voice dropouts when people join a session that is

187
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,020
 the usually avatars or some parts of the syncing process so when you load in you load your

188
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,440
 avatar and loading your avatar will load all of the data about your avatar includes all

189
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,820
 the slots or the assets or the Logix or the equipment or the guns or the halo context

190
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:23,960
 menu opera singers that you've got in and that is what causes the hitches we do have

191
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,040
 the ability to optimize that with some work we just haven't done that work people get

192
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:37,120
 a bad rap for that so you know maybe experiment with your avatar and trying to make it better

193
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,880
 there are optimization techniques on the wiki under optimization guidelines on the wiki

194
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,160
 or something like that big main ones are bake your blend shapes try and reduce the amount

195
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:55,560
 of materials textures etc try to avoid gadgets and stuff you don't need on your avatar and

196
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,020
 it's about it really you know.

197
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:04,040
 Ozzy asked an interesting question which actually drives me mad I just haven't had the opportunity

198
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,540
 to like write up my thoughts on it and be like here's what we should do they say if

199
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,600
 you are in charge of organizing discord channels in here is I think you would change for the

200
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,140
 better in your opinion absolutely let's go top to bottom top to bottom all right okay

201
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:23,000
 cool so we need to get rid of the distinction between community and Neos channels because

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,120
 it's very confusing the Neos development staff needs to go above the Neos channels probably

203
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:37,080
 in the welcome and basic info thing welcome links is good guidelines needs to be removed

204
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,080
 and just referred to the wiki or any of the Google docs that we have the FAQ channel needs

205
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,580
 to be removed and just referred to the wiki or any other FAQ source that we have the discord

206
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,260
 groups channel needs to be deleted it was part of a promotional thing in 2019 that no

207
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,900
 longer exists so it can just go the welcome lobby needs to be deleted we don't need to

208
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,460
 see when people join the server for administration and moderation reasons we have another channel

209
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,720
 that does that you guys can't see it's just a member log common with many discord servers

210
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,980
 the welcome lobby is just a place where it says that people have joined and we don't

211
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,780
 need that our scale we have thousands of people in this discord it's just it's not a functional

212
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:21,620
 channel then coming down to this just the weird gap where we have Neos developments

213
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,860
 and community just needs to not be there the the the what else have we got coming down

214
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:35,840
 here and then we need to enable the the like flashcard badge thingy that pops up when you

215
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,660
 join a server that other servers have but ours doesn't for some reason it sort of says

216
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,340
 like here are the rules here's where the channels are here's what you can do in each channel

217
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,700
 here's a channel we recommend you know that's all sort of configurable he's got like a welcome

218
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,420
 screen feature or something we need that fixed announcements probably needs to go into the

219
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,180
 Neos development section or move higher into welcome and basic info so it's clearer right

220
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,020
 now it's sort of like at the bottom of the Neos channels section which doesn't make any

221
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:09,640
 sense we need to reorganize the community meetings channel so that it is more centrally

222
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,360
 located around office hours so I don't have to say several channels above I just have

223
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,120
 to say one channel above etc that happened when we created voice chat two three and four

224
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:25,080
 because it was busy the patreon voice chat needs to be deleted because it doesn't matter

225
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,120
 why does it exist voice chat text needs to be deleted the reason behind that is because

226
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,340
 Neos not Neos Discord now natively has a text chat per voice channel and if you don't like

227
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,720
 that feature because it's not obvious that it's there I completely understand but there's

228
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,940
 no way to turn it off and therefore what you end up with is two voice text channels per

229
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,900
 voice text the one that like Discord wants to you to use and then the one that which

230
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,240
 a server creator has created and it gets really confusing so the best way around that is basically

231
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,760
 to go use the discord provided one yeah we know the experience is a bit bad but it's

232
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,600
 better than the alternative where the conversation ends up happening in two separate places then

233
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,600
 I would combine alpha testing and testing I don't know what difference between alpha

234
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,560
 testing and testing is so that would be combined I would move the preview features above the

235
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,300
 international channels whilst I you know like on love our international you know channels

236
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,940
 etc there and international communities having those features above might cut down in the

237
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,500
 amount of people getting lost and confused yeah there's there's another testing channel

238
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,340
 I forgot what we're alpha testing but there's another testing channel I don't remember what

239
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,140
 we're testing in it I think it's something to do with Beppu too I really don't remember

240
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,120
 I think you can if you have the danger tester role I don't know I don't know I would also

241
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,060
 consider deleting the archive channels you know how we archive each MMC we archive the

242
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,780
 asset variant system and GDC 2020 while an archive channel can make sense to sort of

243
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,200
 preserve the conversation that occurred a certain point it just becomes a detriment

244
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,220
 because it appears in my search results when I'm trying to find information and it's usually

245
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,940
 old because no one can type in there anymore I'm gonna move on like I would change basically

246
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:09,860
 everything about the discord layout but it's not up to me so moving forwards ramp it says

247
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,420
 how about a new component to trickle load heavy avatars when it's added on world route

248
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,100
 and make it run by a priority of model textures that's not the solution so a lot of times

249
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,940
 we come up with we have with this issue which is is people come up with a solution and then

250
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,660
 they occasionally ramp hasn't done this but occasionally it does happen so ramp are you're

251
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,060
 not doing this but I'm about to rant about it anyway people go I have a solution for

252
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,180
 this problem and then they explain it and then they get mad that we haven't implemented

253
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:46,260
 it the the best way to ensure that that doesn't happen is to state your problem not your solution

254
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,140
 it's called the XY problem so we do have a couple of issues open about sort of world

255
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:57,340
 load order controlling the load order etc the best way to do is to go to those issues comment

256
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,580
 on them with any information or stuff that you need thumbs up them etc and then we know

257
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,660
 that people want us to work on that and then we'll we'll solve the solution there because

258
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:13,280
 the solution unfortunately is not a component to trickle load heavy avatars trickle loading

259
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,120
 heavy avatars would be more about the interfacing between the actual loading process in C sharp

260
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,380
 and Neos itself to make that better like I don't particularly know what's wrong I haven't

261
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,420
 looked into it enough but examples and again this is examples because I have not looked

262
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:37,180
 into this so don't quote me perhaps the loading of avatars isn't multi-threaded enough I don't

263
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,340
 know perhaps the order in which we load an avatar could be flipped upside down or sideways

264
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,040
 to make certain bits load before other bits you know that's all data model stuff that

265
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,280
 isn't component stuff that components are on top of the data model stella asks what

266
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
 are your thoughts on avatar culling systems and you think they can integrate as a native

267
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,980
 feature they should be integrated as a native feature while I like all of the avatar culling

268
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,900
 systems that exist you shouldn't have to do that like that is firmly in my mind is one

269
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,420
 of the features you shouldn't have to do and while it's great and I love seeing those spread

270
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,740
 and being used in worlds and they do make the world better there's like a twang in my

271
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,020
 heart or whatever where I'm like we should have solved this for you we should have solved

272
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,620
 this for you like every single time there's something complicated that all of you guys

273
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,260
 are doing I'm like we should have solved this for you you know another good example would

274
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:31,380
 be Syro wrote an entire mod for this game so they could avoid logics interface cards

275
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,180
 because they got so bothered by logics interface cards and I've been there you know it's like

276
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,420
 3 a.m you've been working on logics for hours you unpack the logics and then like the logic

277
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,780
 interface cards are like yo let's party and then they're just like everywhere and you

278
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,300
 can't do anything about it uh rampant says I thought the spike was called by everything

279
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,020
 starting to load at one moment uh yeah that again that like fixing that would be data

280
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,140
 model that wouldn't be the component layer oh yes my uh some people I needed to respond

281
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,560
 with tax uh information I've got back to the tax information which means I need to process

282
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,080
 about 40 pdf files and send them to my accountant I'm gonna have so much fun after this office

283
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,620
 hours oh so much fun um I just thought I'd let you know that sorry the email came in

284
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,180
 and I saw it was taxed and I'm just like damn it uh dia says how much of the performance

285
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,940
 issues are caused by unity not quite sure like how to measure that like you can measure

286
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,800
 it in in various ways so there are issues caused by um unity forcing us to be sort of

287
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,440
 down rev on the basic c-sharp language there are also issues which caused by unity forcing

288
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,580
 us to be on a downward version of dotnet which is built on top of the c-sharp language and

289
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,940
 both of those things can lead to performance issues then there's rendering which can lead

290
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,260
 to additional performance issues then there's just how unity puts stuff together in the

291
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,180
 render which can cause performance issues there's the interop which is how we communicate

292
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,860
 with unity that can cause performance issues there's just so many angles there and I don't

293
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,920
 really know how to measure that in a way that would make sense it would be quite considerable

294
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,520
 but the amount of work required to replace unity is also quite considerable Lou asks

295
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,500
 uh do we know why logic cards seem to multiply when I'm packing with multiple users in the

296
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,860
 session yes that is a long-standing bug which every single person that has ever had access

297
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,220
 to the code base has tried to fix and fail it you know there's um there's that image

298
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,180
 about a comment um I'll try and find it really quickly yep here we go there's there's various

299
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:36,220
 parts of this but uh this this is you know that that is logic's interface cards um so

300
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,260
 yeah freaks of course try to fix it they of course understand it the most um but when

301
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,460
 new people are added to the team that have access to the code base they're like cool

302
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,180
 I'll try and fix that too and then they can't um so yeah I know coffee tried when they're

303
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,500
 on the team I know outsider tried I know I've tried I know gains took a look at one point

304
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,400
 like we've all tried to fix it but uh it's it's been difficult so what's meant to happen

305
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,100
 is that when um the logic's interface cards spawn um either by unpacking or when you spawn

306
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,700
 them because you're creating your logics that logic's interface proxy component is meant

307
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,420
 to sort of mark one that exists and the whole system is meant to pick up on that and say

308
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,280
 like all right this one is the one that we should use we don't need to generate another

309
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,940
 one but something really confusing in the engine goes like yeah I don't know I can't

310
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,340
 see that one or something along the lines of that so it makes a new one on top of that

311
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,380
 though I don't know why they move like if they didn't move I would have less of an issue

312
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,820
 about it but they randomly move and it's really confusing to me um they usually seem to just

313
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,420
 get further and further away from things I don't really understand that like I understand

314
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,300
 when it's like a tool or a gun or a weapon whatever you want to call it um because that's

315
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:57,300
 being rotated and spun around and passed between people etc but in that case I don't understand

316
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:02,220
 why they're not just sort of turning upside down or sideways and stuff they appear to

317
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,020
 just sort of be like orbiting and going further and further out I don't understand.

318
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,740
 Let's take a look next uh Ozzy says uh is there a way to change the maximum of undo

319
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,900
 steps in the world you can do it via the slot that's non-persistent doesn't save uh probably

320
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,180
 a feature request for that one there's probably a reason we have it at a certain level I know

321
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,260
 that we need to do a lot of work on undo undo is fantastic but um if you've been playing

322
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,500
 Neos enough you'll know that some cases undo doesn't do what you want it to do and it can

323
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,580
 actually cause problems um it's either an operation that you've done does not register

324
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,140
 via the undo system or it does but not in an order that you can control or it's a multi-step

325
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,060
 process and so what you get is you do undo and you've only done like half of it and then

326
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,980
 you need to undo again and then you start spamming it and you undo too much like I had

327
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,260
 the grab I was recording a video the other day and I had a grab and so I let go of the

328
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,820
 grab I don't remember what it was I was just grabbing something and it was in the wrong

329
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,660
 position so I thought I'll undo it but for some reason the undo system didn't register

330
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,220
 that grab and so it popped up the undo tree um to the next undo which unscrubbed through

331
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,700
 a video which is a key part of the recording we were um some of the medical stuff we were

332
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:18,340
 following a video which is a patient exam letter by letter procedure by procedure and

333
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,640
 we were using the video as a sort of like um reference about what we needed to do so

334
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,440
 I unscrubbed the video like back to the start of the video and then we'd lost our place

335
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,620
 we didn't know which test was next and it was just like yeah undo system why all right

336
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,740
 moving forwards uh Lex says there's quite a few features in Neos that people use stroke

337
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,340
 exploit they're only possible due to the components logics having side effects for example the

338
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,580
 component that manages the whisper bubble allows you to distinguish between a normal

339
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,620
 whisper bubble a voice message bubble only due to the fact that it's a different color

340
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,980
 gets set on the bubble material for a voice message or standard bubble would you rather

341
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,700
 people use these kind of set effects or have separate options for every single component

342
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,780
 logic snow to properly expose those features um I would rather there be a separate um property

343
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:11,420
 etc um so trying to just double check I understand here okay so you're detecting that a voice

344
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,780
 message is happening on your avatar because it uses a different color on the bubble yeah

345
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,900
 instead there may be on the whisper bubble manager or whatever we should have check boxes

346
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:28,580
 which are like in conversational bubble in voice message bubble and then that way you

347
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,380
 can key off those booleans um keying off that material would probably be problematic because

348
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,500
 if we change the default way that bubble works then suddenly the color isn't changing and

349
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,980
 then your code breaks that problem that Lex um has described here is identical to the

350
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,140
 problem behind the whole permission thing um people are like I want to get the permission

351
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,840
 role etc and it's like yeah you can get it in like five different ways but like none

352
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,500
 of those are recommended and they're all of the things to avoid list because they're hacky

353
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,620
 and we want to provide a way to do it properly um but to do that we need to do it sort of

354
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,100
 securely and we're not quite sure how to do that one yet people say why securely think

355
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,220
 about it right there's a piece of logics which says if you are a builder you can do super

356
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,820
 awesome admin thing and it's using strings for comparison uh well I could write some

357
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,220
 logics which finds that string or write a mod which finds that string and update it

358
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,900
 to if you're any any role you can do super super admin stuff and it's not it's not secure

359
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,100
 uh Troppy gives examples of the undo system being weird they say drawing uh move or delete

360
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,380
 a stroke or hit and hit undo maybe it's the wrong spot or doesn't underly yeah the drawing

361
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,320
 system is kind of weird it's like one of the examples of where the undo system is usually

362
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,860
 good is the drawing system but I understand how like there's there's sometimes gaps there

363
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,180
 uh with that I've seen chat die down so we're gonna go ahead and call it here we are at

364
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,320
 eight minutes over thank you so much for joining me today I hope you enjoyed um the questions

365
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,060
 that we've answered if you have any more questions please drop them in the questions and help

366
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,180
 channel um or ping me directly or open up a GitHub issue if it's a feature request um

367
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,700
 quick reminder just uh randomly if you have an issue that is moderation in nature make

368
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,820
 a ticket don't DM me I'm just gonna ask you to to make a ticket uh Fakir if you have a

369
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,340
 question please go for it I will make an exception for you because you seem sad that you are

370
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:21,860
 too late so go ahead um I will wait um for one more minute so you better type quickly

371
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,060
 uh whilst I talk about moderation some more yeah if you have an issue that's moderation

372
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,140
 related make a ticket don't DM me don't come into Neos and talk to me about it just make

373
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:34,200
 a ticket um you're free feel free to come and talk to me about it but I'm gonna tell

374
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:42,300
 you to make a ticket the whole world has their eyes on oh there we go um Faku says when you

375
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:49,420
 scale under a very small height the lighting gets very buggy um yes that is caused by um

376
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:56,500
 that is caused by floating point imprecision um floating point imprecision is caused by

377
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,380
 the computer that you're running um Neos on being unable to represent such small numbers

378
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,620
 um you need to understand how floating points work to like really understand why that's

379
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:15,100
 the case um the only way for us to fix it at that scale is for um us to switch to using

380
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:21,820
 doubles which are double length um double width uh floats uh for position which isn't

381
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:28,580
 something that is popular or common in computing right now I'm sure it will be as we sort of

382
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,020
 move towards better computers bigger processes etc um but it just isn't right now uh the

383
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:41,540
 one thing I will say to that though is remember that you have a lot of headroom above compared

384
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:48,280
 to below and so something I've been experimenting in with worlds that require smallness is um

385
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,740
 making the default scale of the world times 10 or times 100 and what that gives you is

386
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,940
 a little bit more precision back the other way you know you don't have to start at one

387
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,860
 move the needle to the left make everything 10 times big including users you can do that

388
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,140
 you can make them 10 times bigger they won't even realize it if you do it correctly and

389
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,620
 when they shrink themselves they'll be a little bit more room in the maths um not much but

390
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,660
 a little bit more room it occurs in in basically every game um good example be I know they

391
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,460
 fixed it but uh in Minecraft there used to be this thing called the far lands where when

392
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,060
 you went really really really far out in the world generation it would get weird because

393
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,260
 math was breaking down um there's an example of it in VR chat I know there's actually a

394
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:36,060
 world where you can go through doors and they'll teleport you large magnitudes away from spawn

395
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:41,060
 until floating point stuff happens I have one of those worlds half built I stopped building

396
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,020
 it when froukes made it so that when you get to the really really problematic floating

397
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:51,220
 point numbers you just respawn um because then it was is less less fun um more recently

398
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,340
 siro found siro it must have been sorry it was there they found this weird component

399
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,380
 in uncategorized which is called like up down button control or something anyway we made

400
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,340
 an instant willy wonka elevator and took us up into the sky to floating point range that

401
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,420
 was fun uh with that we'll go ahead and leave off as I said before ask questions wherever

402
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,100
 you want them aim me um DM me whatever you'd like and I'll get back to you whenever I can

403
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,260
 I will speak to you next time bye bye
