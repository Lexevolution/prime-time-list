00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 It is the top of the hour so go ahead and get started. Welcome to Office Hours, the half hour segment where I answer your questions about Nias.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,200
 Please drop your questions in the Office Hours text chat and I'll get to them in the order that they appear.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,080
 If you don't know why you're here or you're hearing a voice and you don't know why it's because you clicked an announcement that appeared and you've now joined the Office Hours meeting stage.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,160
 Please stay, ask questions about Nias, I'll answer them in the order that they appear.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,360
 We have a question. Ray! Lex asks

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,880
 What do you think would be a good world permission setup and access level be for users who, for someone who wants to create something

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,760
 but doesn't mind visitors watching but also gets distracted easily?

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,720
 I've been thinking about this a lot and like

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,560
 I built a few things as well when I was trying to do it a while ago.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,640
 Think about limiting

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,360
 limiting stuff by both the permission system. So the permission system by just setting them to spectator

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,320
 they won't be able to spawn anything. Loads of people will literally lose their minds if they can't spawn stuff.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,320
 That's more sort of function of them than you though, because if you've ever played other VR platforms

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,880
 you can't spawn stuff in those platforms. So just sit still and don't squirm about that one.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:10,760
 The next level you can do is some form of like notification when they join the world like hey, I'm building like don't distract me.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,600
 But I've also been experimenting with like red velvet ropes if that makes sense.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,000
 I didn't do it in that way. I think I did it with like just like a like a sphere or a cylinder mesh.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,200
 Where it's like hey, don't like don't cross this line, right? I made it so like they were still with an earshot.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,800
 They could still talk to me, but it's like don't like don't get up in my space, you know.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,920
 But more than like personal space where you know, they're like, you know in your personal space. It's more like workshop space.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,600
 Almost felt like a museum. That wasn't that effective, but it did prevent the amazing problem.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,400
 Which is people who like to enter this thing that you're building go right inside it. Their entire

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
 avatar, like put their butt square in your logics and then go FK or spawn a whisper bubble.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,200
 They've just got like no concept of what's behind them. Which means like that's like another good thing like for everyone who's playing.

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,400
 Be aware of your surroundings. So as an example here,

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:16,000
 many of you I hope have some form of drink near you. It might be in a cup or a can or a bottle or whatever it is.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,400
 You know where that is and you have knowledge about where that is.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,000
 So you're not gonna just like, you know, flail your arms around or whatever and knock it over.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,640
 The same thing needs to happen in VR.

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,360
 Like if you're standing in an area, be aware of what's behind you to the left of you to the right of you. The amount of

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,960
 times I just get like

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,880
 unsolicited like butts in my face because people just aren't aware of their surroundings about where people are is just amazing.

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,240
 Like, you know, if VR has this gigantic field of view,

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,600
 use it.

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,720
 Situational and positional awareness of things. Don't knock over that cup. Don't go AFK inside someone's logics.

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,520
 I'll just kick you these days because like you clearly don't understand boundaries or anything like that.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
 If you go AFK inside my logics.

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,360
 Beyond that another thing I've considered doing but I don't know if people would be up for or joining is

39
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:13,320
 similar to the prime exhibition thing is making it so spectators can't spawn their own avatar and so spectators are muted. At that point

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,080
 it sort of becomes stuffy though and you sort of turns into sort of like a performance piece

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,280
 where it's like welcome to the theater.

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,000
 Prime is at the center of the theater on stage playing the violin. You're expected to be quiet whilst this happens.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So I don't really know if that actually works.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,520
 I think I had to do that once because I was just like, you know, people just get it.

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,800
 Once people understand it, they get kind of like good at it. I've had lots of experience with people sort of

46
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,440
 have been watching me build stuff for a bit and then other people come in and the new people that come in kind of sort

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,240
 of get wrangled by the old people. It's like hey, you know come over here, Prime's building, we can chat over here, right?

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,720
 They're over in the corner like enjoying memes and stuff and still engaging conversation with me

49
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,160
 but they're kind of self wrangling themselves into a corner. Honestly though

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,600
 I think one of the bigger things you can do is expose people to that being a problem.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,560
 I noticed a lot of people hide in private worlds, which is absolutely fine.

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,300
 But if the reason that you're hiding in a private world is because you can't set boundaries with people that enter your world

53
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,020
 then perhaps try setting boundaries in your open world, right?

54
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,880
 There is a problem in

55
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,800
 the furry community in general where confrontation of any kind is avoided

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
 and I actually want to change that. Like I had an idea,

57
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,440
 I probably won't do it particularly whilst this, you know, messy announcements channel is in place, of

58
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,160
 doing like a Neos debate club. Like the reason why they do debate clubs at like high schools, etc. is to get people

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,800
 used to the idea that having differing opinions is okay and

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,860
 having healthy discussions about those differing opinions is also okay.

61
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,180
 A good example I give to people is your favorite color is not my favorite color and that's fine.

62
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,020
 No one needs to be angry about it. No one needs to be upset about it.

63
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,180
 But it just seems like particularly with the furry community when there is any disagreement whatsoever

64
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,840
 it turns into like a gigantic deal that can lead to sort of like I'll cancel you on Twitter proportions over just like silly things.

65
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,280
 It's like just like recognize that not everyone is out to be a vicious attacker at you.

66
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,120
 Some are of course, but let them prove to you that that's what they're there to do.

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,700
 Don't assume that that's what they're there to do. I met this person in in Viaca over the weekend and

68
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,760
 they were saying something along the lines of like there were lots of

69
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,000
 Brazilian population were in the world and he was actually, you know, trying to learn the language.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,040
 We had another Brazilian who was translating for us. It was quite a good conversation.

71
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
 But this person who was learning it

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,540
 or sort of lamenting about like how it was easier for people to learn languages when they're younger

73
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,680
 and you know, I piped up and said, you know, you're absolutely right. Here's why etc.

74
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
 And then I said but you're doing a good job

75
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,580
 like, you know, because I could recognize that they were doing a good job.

76
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,480
 But for some reason they they took that as like a personal attack. I was like, yeah, it is gonna be harder for you.

77
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,680
 But you are doing a good job. I was basically complimenting them on the fact that they were doing a good job.

78
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,640
 But they were like, oh, hang on a minute. Like I told you you were doing a good job and explained why it's harder.

79
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,000
 That's that's all I did.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,520
 And it was okay if like that was the only time it happened, but like pretty much everything I said to them

81
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,600
 they treated it as like an attack and I'm just like hey just like chill out, please. So yeah set boundaries.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,440
 There's nothing wrong with saying like hey, can you move backwards a bit?

83
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,640
 If they can't see on Twitter over that then they weren't worth speaking to in the first place.

84
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,760
 Moving onwards to Fance conversation. Question even.

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,000
 Fance says, is there a method

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,340
 stroke app to clean the assets folder and see the dependencies and links in the hierarchy explicitly?

87
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,520
 I've tried to use the asset tool in the us, but it deleted objects that I want to keep in my entire tavern.

88
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,720
 So I'm having trust issues of that tool. It depends how you're using it.

89
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,100
 I know of one user who will remain unnamed because it was a really unfortunate thing.

90
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:02,400
 They put their entire world inside the assets folder in the slot hierarchy and it deleted itself because that's what the asset folder is meant to do.

91
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,640
 So don't do that.

92
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,280
 I've seen one person that does that so I presume other people might be accidentally doing that. And then the thing there is to understand

93
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,720
 what is going on there with that asset folder. By default in the session settings page

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,040
 you've got the clean up unused assets checked on. That should always be checked on.

95
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,760
 There's no reason to have it not checked on. That will be cleaning up unused assets.

96
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,000
 Like so you shouldn't need to do anything there.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,320
 The problem that you might have though is where the

98
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,840
 Neo system thinks the assets are still being used and won't remove them from that folder.

99
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,800
 I honestly wouldn't worry about it

100
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,480
 but if you are going to worry about it

101
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,440
 make sure that you close the world and reopen it. Because just closing the world and reopening it will like clear out a lot.

102
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,680
 Like for example, if someone comes into your world spawns out a bunch of shit, like it's gonna be in the assets folder for a while.

103
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,280
 But if you close the world and reopen it to continue working on it, that asset folder will be cleaned up.

104
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,780
 Additionally remember things such as the pink trashcan is the best thing for handling those assets. Beyond that

105
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,240
 I'd have to take a look at exactly what you're doing in that world because there might be some issues there.

106
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,640
 But provided the automatically clean up checkbox is enabled, you shouldn't have to use that tool there.

107
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,840
 That tool should be entirely safe. It just you just you have to figure out what you're doing.

108
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,260
 Lex jumping around because Lex says I know one reason to turn off that checkbox.

109
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,280
 Model plan emotions in a model only the first one gets set up and it will delete the rest since they're not referenced.

110
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,800
 You can prevent that by putting a component called an asset provider or asset loader.

111
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,540
 I think it's one of those. The asset provider or asset loader will keep the asset loaded in the world and prevent it from being

112
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,800
 chunked up.

113
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,480
 So try that. I don't remember if it's loader or provider though, so try both.

114
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:47,320
 You shouldn't usually need to do that because I don't know if it's like this in the hierarchy tree, but

115
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,280
 the like static mesh and

116
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,560
 animation you do to add like those sorts of components they might inherit the behavior from the asset loader component.

117
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,540
 So don't like go adding them for everything.

118
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,380
 You only need to add it in the particular case where you're sort of swapping out the references to multiple animations.

119
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,420
 If you search for asset load or asset provider in this discord, I think you'll even find a lovely

120
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:19,060
 fruit something about them. I'll still wait for another question. I'm gonna cut this loose thread out of my clothing. There we go.

121
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,380
 Vacuum. I'm gonna do that immediately following this. I'm gonna vacuum.

122
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,200
 Okay, we have another question. Does slot order affect the order in which a world is loaded and if so, how strictly?

123
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
 I don't know, but I wouldn't want you

124
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,260
 doing it that way. I don't think it does.

125
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,820
 Biggest thing you can do for world loading is make sure that you watch the very very very first tutorial

126
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,760
 I ever made and set your floor collider up correctly.

127
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,200
 So many people don't do that or they put like a

128
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,500
 cylinder procedural mesh in the floor because they don't understand how the floor stuff works.

129
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,200
 So they're just like, well if the world doesn't load you'll land on the cylinder and I'm like, oh you could just make it

130
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,460
 so I hover in the air until the floor loads and they're like how?

131
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,720
 And I'm like, it's only the first tutorial I ever ever recorded.

132
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,060
 That says I guess I made a mistake setting up the world. I have a lot in that folder holders.

133
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,240
 I don't know what you mean by holders.

134
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,640
 Holders get spawned a lot when using red X, but they shouldn't occur in normal world operations.

135
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,280
 So I really don't know what you're doing, but I think you're doing something wrong.

136
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,280
 You shouldn't have anything inside the asset folder

137
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,960
 that you've explicitly put there. If you have to go in there, you should question why you should go in there.

138
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,800
 Like of course you can, I'm not saying you can't. I'm just saying like if you have to go in there

139
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,160
 it means that you're into some pretty advanced stuff like regular

140
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,560
 like world building shouldn't mean anyone to go in that folder or take a look at it.

141
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,240
 Oh, yeah, there is there is like holder dash assets in there. Yeah. Yeah, just like

142
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,440
 move everything outside of that folder that is stuff that you've added to the world yourself.

143
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,360
 You shouldn't be putting stuff in there.

144
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,320
 I'd love to sort of get some way to sort of separate it from the rest of the components and slots in the hierarchy

145
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,320
 so it's more clear because now we've had two people that I know of that have made that mistake, but

146
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,480
 nothing you make should go in there. As for seeing the links, no, there's no way to see the links there.

147
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,320
 But like I said, you shouldn't need to go in there. Like it should be automatically taken care of.

148
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,640
 The automatically clean up asset checkbox in the session settings should be doing everything for you.

149
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,240
 As should when you restart the world, it should flush out all the sort of guns, lasers and avatars people spawn in.

150
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,520
 Don't like don't go in there. If you're like hyper optimizing, which I know I know the Discord love,

151
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,160
 they're like, oh my god, let's like avoid logics because it's bad. It's not bad.

152
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,760
 Let's like mono pack because that makes it better. It really doesn't make it that much better.

153
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,440
 Let's like, you know, discuss the intricacies between value driver and value copy and I'm like, oh my god,

154
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,440
 just like I get it, but like relax a little bit.

155
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,000
 Like there is such a thing as like too much optimization. The most complicated world

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,780
 I've ever done is my virtual surgical planning world.

157
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:07,000
 I haven't thought about optimization ever. It runs at 90 FPS when we're doing surgery.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,640
 So like I have never thought about optimizing it.

159
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,760
 There's lots of stuff I could do but it runs at 90 FPS when there's three surgeons in there discussing a surgery.

160
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
 So I don't really care.

161
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,340
 All right, let's take a look. Specs asks, why is it sometimes I can't use fly locomotion if I haven't walked or initialized the floor yet?

162
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:30,400
 Yeah, that's just like fly locomotion is physical locomotion. So it's probably still waiting for the floor collider to be there.

163
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,080
 I've also experienced the thing where like you have to walk on it once before you can fly.

164
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,320
 That might be a bug in the fly locomotion preset.

165
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,140
 But we'd have to look look into that one.

166
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,840
 It might just be because like the physical locomotion was like just slightly

167
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,460
 gently hammered to make the fly locomotion.

168
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:58,480
 So maybe that's the problem. Shadow says, I'm curious just how some worlds have dedicated loading zones that always load first.

169
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,480
 Give me an example and we can go take a look at it. We can load into it and inspect a bunch of stuff.

170
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,040
 Simple things tend to load faster though.

171
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,880
 So like text and just like a standard material that just has a color on it. That doesn't need to load texture files.

172
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,440
 So sometimes that would just load faster just because it's simple.

173
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,160
 So that might be what they're doing. I'll have to see what they're doing.

174
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,580
 There is the possibility that there is some sort of mod that allows you to sort of interface in that system or somehow

175
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,880
 I don't know. There's nothing I can think of the top of my head.

176
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,160
 I can like go look there now, but I will run out of time quickly if I just went and did that.

177
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,320
 All right, I'm Aaron has a question.

178
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,720
 Do you think it'd be good idea for the future for Neos to officially make versions of user-created systems such as world cleanup systems or

179
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
 world coloring systems?

180
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,960
 Yes.

181
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,140
 Something which is like always been part of Neos's philosophy is

182
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,840
 allowing you to customize everything whilst also providing sort of sane defaults. Good example being the avatar system.

183
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,840
 It's called the common avatar system because you can make other avatar systems.

184
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:11,440
 I've yet to see anyone that actually does this. Closest would be the any land folks who do it in a good way.

185
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,840
 But I think it's wrong. I think Frix intended you to do it slightly differently, but like hey, it doesn't matter.

186
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:26,360
 There are ways to avoid using the common avatar system to make avatars that Frix has talked about before but hasn't really explained.

187
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,720
 But the point is we would probably provide some sort of automated system to do it in the future.

188
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:39,720
 But that would be sort of an optional system that maybe would would enable on new worlds by default just to give new users or

189
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,160
 new world creators a good thing. Maybe there'll be a panel or configuration dialogue to turn it off if you want to use your own one.

190
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,280
 But we're never going to prevent

191
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,680
 the community from making their own.

192
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,160
 Particularly if they think their own is better in some way for some feature.

193
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,280
 But yeah, it would be good idea to have good sane defaults. I want a good sane default for culling.

194
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:07,840
 Audio zones, I want to fix up that. It's wrong. I don't know what's wrong about it, but it's wrong right now.

195
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
 I shouldn't be able to hear someone from like

196
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,880
 miles away on the map, but doesn't make any sense.

197
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,080
 World cleanup is a difficult one.

198
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,360
 Because while yeah, we could totally add that as a native system that also is again a social thing.

199
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,920
 People need to be told and taught that that is a problem that they are making MS.

200
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,960
 Another good one is gestures. Like I just I hate hand-based gestures with a passion.

201
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,880
 And you can't convince me elsewhere.

202
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,520
 I use my hands a lot when talking anyway.

203
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,080
 And so I don't have time for them to be in particular hand shapes to make me smile or whatever.

204
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,600
 That's just it just it's it's not the way that it's meant to be done. The face tracker would be closer to all the way

205
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,360
 it's meant to be done.

206
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,760
 But like it's not meant to be hand driven.

207
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,120
 Like there are some people that for example like if their hand is closed their eyes are closed.

208
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,440
 I'm just like what if you're holding something? Doesn't make any sense to me.

209
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,320
 But having said that we may want to add a

210
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:17,000
 standard system for that that's really easy to use. I'm thinking like you know select the gesture point, select the thing you want to do, done.

211
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,320
 I know that there are tons of community-made systems that do that.

212
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,600
 But they always have a point where you can see that they're not native.

213
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,640
 Like what was one actually in the in the MMC this year, and it was like almost perfect

214
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,000
 but didn't work with my avatar for some reason.

215
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,560
 And also you know requires a lot of haggy stuff behind the scene to sort of find an open inspector.

216
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,320
 It's just like it shouldn't be complicated.

217
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,080
 So again making that system will be good. Again of course allowing for people to make their own.

218
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,800
 I'm happy so I have to do thumbs up or I'm not happy.

219
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,920
 Oh, I want to be sad so I have to like you know do the American Sign Language sign for like

220
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,240
 poo poo poo poo, and then my like face turns into like a sad face. Like it just it

221
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
 There's this TV show called The Magicians

222
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,640
 which is a magic show and well that makes it sound like you know pulling rabbits out of a hat.

223
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,080
 It's a show about magic. It's really good, but

224
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,080
 they have a very particular way of doing magic which is

225
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,760
 incredibly hand-based and

226
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,320
 I always think whatever like I see people in VRChat are like yeah, that that looks like exactly what you're doing with your hands

227
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,800
 just to make yourself smile.

228
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:40,520
 I'm just looking at the gifts available for the show because I don't want any spoilers because there are so many like

229
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:48,920
 You know some shows have like really big spoilers like you know season 12 this person dies season 13 this person like

230
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:57,080
 commits mass murder or whatever like Magicians has got like five or so of that like level of spoiler per season

231
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
 so like it's very difficult.

232
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,520
 Okay, here's the here's the closest gift. I don't even remember the context of this one

233
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,840
 but like it's just like it's so over the top and

234
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,200
 all he gets is a glowy bracelet, and I don't remember what the glowy bracelet does.

235
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,880
 No

236
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,960
 I'd have to look at the the timing

237
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,440
 but Magicians is based on a book series that describes these hand movements quite well as far as I remember.

238
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,400
 It's Dr. Strange is always weird because they

239
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,120
 they just summon like orange circles.

240
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,160
 It's all they do and then that's what you don't like you see in the films you see all of the sort of acolytes

241
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,920
 I guess they're all just like summoning orange circles and then Dr. Strange and

242
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,600
 the other guy the Asian guy he like they're the only ones that get to do like what looks like any

243
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,320
 anything that isn't an orange circle.

244
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,800
 Moving on to actual questions.

245
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,240
 It's a really good show guys you should you should watch it if anyone does watch it when you're done

246
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,600
 there's like five seasons so come back after five seasons. Let me know you'll be glad.

247
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,600
 There's a musical episode per season as well, and it always makes sense it doesn't feel forced.

248
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
 Anyway back to questions.

249
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,080
 Ered says if you were to make a gesture system how would you personally have users interact with it? Would it be a component that drives blend chips or would it be a logic system?

250
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,300
 It it would not be obvious to the user that they are

251
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,600
 doing anything technical and that's the big challenge.

252
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,640
 If you think about things like actually here's a good example

253
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,160
 an installer for an application on your computer when you install an application on your computer

254
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:37,560
 you're just going next next next on a wizard right maybe you select which folder or hard drive it goes to or what parts of the

255
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
 software you want, but you're not doing anything really technical there

256
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,000
 you're just making choices, and then you're hitting next. You can install applications another way

257
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,760
 which is downloading a zip unzipping it and then run the EXE that happens a lot with more

258
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,040
 open source based applications because they don't have the

259
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,960
 will or in some cases the money to make a standard installer application

260
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,260
 and then that's you know more technical and then you get the amazingly technical thing

261
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,840
 which is trying to install nvidia drivers on Linux like right now gesture systems without

262
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,040
 things that made like the MMC one I mentioned they feel like trying to install nvidia graphics card drivers on Linux

263
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,960
 with the systems they feel like you know downloading and extracting a zip archive

264
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,960
 but what I want is just like the installation wizard you know where it's like ah

265
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,120
 you know welcome to the avatar setup

266
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,120
 what do you want to do and then like oh I want it to serve my like thumbs up like I do the like closed eyes

267
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,300
 and my eyes are smiley and my face is smiley and like you know

268
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,300
 candy

269
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,500
 candy cane falls out my ears great cool. We'll set that up for you without any technicalities

270
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,100
 I don't really know what that looks like blend shapes are totally easy

271
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,060
 And the other thing is like with a Neos built one we could handle the multiple blend shapes driving problem

272
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,200
 Which is like one of the like major

273
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,160
 major like bottlenecks I see in people's brains when it comes to gestures they can't they can't

274
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,020
 make the sort of

275
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,120
 intuition about how to do that

276
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,400
 Whereas we could just handle that right they would they would maybe select their gestures

277
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,560
 And then we would just behind the scenes we would do it however we wanted to do it drive nose components

278
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,080
 Whatever you want. Shadow says speaking of ease of use do you think a GPT

279
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,120
 4 powered knee assistant could be possible in the future. Yeah sure I mean it'll probably be a plug-in right now

280
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,500
 and the reason is because

281
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,420
 You guys integrating it perfectly fine us integrating it we're gonna have to pay

282
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,540
 Open air money the other thing is like AI is growing exponentially

283
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,900
 But I want to make sure that enough people understand

284
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:46,200
 What's actually happening which is all GPT 4 does is it predicts the most likely next character in a response?

285
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,920
 And it looks really good

286
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,620
 But like it does make errors and I worry that like a lot of people are going like it looks cool because it works 90%

287
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,340
 Of the time, but like it's really bad in some cases. It's almost like remember that thing at school where

288
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,140
 You know you were told you couldn't use Wikipedia for your research. It's like oh, okay

289
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,740
 Why it's like oh because Wikipedia doesn't validate its sources it does and it did at the time that you're in school, but

290
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,120
 It's the crew of doing that and Wikipedia does not validate its sources, right?

291
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,040
 It doesn't validate its sources because in some cases it doesn't understand its sources right its sources

292
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,100
 Just oh, it's a 80% chance that an E occurs after this character

293
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,940
 I will put an either even if it makes no sense. It just happens to make sense a lot of the time

294
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,940
 I also don't know how it would handle

295
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:40,780
 Continually to being updated right so the problem is right now. I don't know V for as I'm a little too V for was enough

296
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,920
 But I knew that V3 was up to sort of the end of 2021 so it's already two years out of date

297
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,240
 We need to get to a point where we can feed new information into it like it needs

298
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,380
 Let's say there's a new update to Neos it has a new component and new logics node

299
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,540
 We need to know about that and so we'd probably need like sub brains

300
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:06,120
 I think is the term where we're able to update its knowledge based on the Neos update notes based on new documentation

301
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:13,980
 Right now that would require probably like additional training or retraining. I don't know how that would work thought Bing was a different model

302
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,500
 oh well

303
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:21,020
 It's something that like I probably should have got into if I wasn't in like Neos

304
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:27,520
 Sometimes I'm just like if Neos didn't exist like would I have more or less

305
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,220
 money fun fame happiness

306
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,260
 Excitement with my day, and I don't I don't know at this point. You know I was really into motor sports

307
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,060
 I hate motor sport racing, but I was into the technical parts of it. I would never get on a motorcycle

308
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
 You couldn't pay me a million dollars to get on a motorcycle

309
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,620
 But I was into the sport racing as a technical thing because that was my job, and it was really fun

310
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,900
 Then that died and I found mixer, and it was like cool. I'm into video game streaming

311
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,820
 I guess and then it was like yeah, but I'm on my own in my bedroom

312
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,380
 Living room, and it was like cool. I'll put on this VR headset

313
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,980
 I bought and it was VRChat VRChat VRChat, and it's like oh Neos is cool. Yeah, Prime doesn't even ride a scooter

314
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,460
 I have one of those like electric scooters. I'm just terrified of it

315
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,740
 I used to own a one-wheel if anyone knows the one-wheel yeah, you probably understand why I sold it

316
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,080
 Those things are just scary I used to be quite proficient at riding it

317
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,980
 But I felt like I was gonna die whilst riding it so I I saw that here we go

318
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,820
 Here's a gif of a man riding a one-wheel so it's self balancing via

319
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,780
 like Sentra what's from a call it force and

320
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,080
 You lean forward to go faster lean back to go slower

321
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,220
 If you push it too far by leaning forwards too much or going at too high a speed it will

322
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,760
 Adjust its velocity to tell you you're going too fast by

323
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,820
 the result you get there is it will tip backwards and that's saying bro slow down and

324
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,060
 90% of one-wheel users ignore that and they push even faster and

325
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,500
 Then it just cuts out because it can't keep you balanced anymore

326
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,060
 And then you face plant onto the floor, and it's like the number one complaint with those things

327
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,580
 But it's mentioned in the safety manual, but no one reads it so you know there. We go. I was riding it

328
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,540
 Let's just say like one quarter of that speed it has like modes in the app

329
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:26,160
 But you can set it on and they're all called like really like space age things like Sequoia and stuff like that

330
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,980
 But basically it's like baby a little bit less of a baby, and I want to break my face

331
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,300
 It's like the last mode. I don't know what it's actually called, but it's pretty much that yeah, I sold it

332
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
 I sold it for like pretty much

333
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,940
 The same I bought it from as well, which is amazing and when I gave it to the person

334
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,200
 I was like you know this will like kill you if you're not careful right and he's like yeah

335
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,260
 I've got one of the small ones. I think they're called pints

336
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,580
 I just wanted to upgrade to the big one and I'm like okay

337
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,740
 Just don't kill yourself then he gave me the money and I kind of just left knowing he might accidentally kill himself

338
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,740
 But there we go

339
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:03,220
 I don't recommend them the whole idea was to get that and then one wheel to the officer back, but then you know I

340
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,260
 Scary anyway that we are at half past

341
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,080
 I'm gonna go ahead and leave off here if you have any additional questions people in the questions that help Channel

342
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,460
 DM me or whatever you'd like oh and one final note make tickets like if you have a moderation issue make tickets

343
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,200
 I got a few DMS this week, and it's just like make a ticket. It's moderation make a ticket

344
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,840
