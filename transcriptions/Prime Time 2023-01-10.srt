1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Okay, welcome to Prime Time. It is 4 p.m. so we need to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,300
 We've got some questions lined up in the Office Hours text chat, so if you have additional questions, please line them up.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,720
 I'll get to them in the order that I appear. I'm just gonna @tag Office Hours one more time to let them know that we're starting, and then we'll get going.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,980
 All right, so questions. So, Alex says, "Hey Prime, how does Neos generate thumbnails for inventory items?"

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,060
 I know approximately, but I don't know where in the code it might be.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,060
 I can probably get there if I go to the inventory browser and I look at the code for the plus button.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:39,060
 I think that should be easier to find than the context menu one, so I'll look for that.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,060
 And I'll save and held items to the inventory. Here it is.

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,060
 Add item. Here it is. Here we go. Add item.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,060
 inventory link.

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,060
 Link for save and handle.

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,060
 Here we go. Item helper.SaveItem. This looks like a good thing.

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,060
 Save item internal. Reference proxies can save item slot.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,060
 It's an avatar. If there's metadata.

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,060
 Okay, if there's no thumbnail...

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:12,060
 Yeah, so there's a function on slots called renderToAsset, which will basically take a screenshot of a particular slot hierarchy.

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,060
 That's a cool function.

18
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:23,060
 It does that by looking at your head position, but it also tries to take into account bounding box and stuff like that.

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,060
 Which gets annoying sometimes when you've got really large items, and sometimes there's like...

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,060
 Either a baby or a small deer is injured in the corridor. I apologize for that delay in my brain.

21
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,060
 You know when deers make really loud noises? That's what I just heard from my corridor.

22
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:51,060
 Anyway, yeah. So it basically just takes a photo of the item from your head as like a source position, but trying to encompass the entire item's bounding box.

23
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,060
 It is similar to the renderToTextureLogix node. Everything's kind of like the same code path.

24
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,060
 I wouldn't be surprised if they used like the same code. I'd have to dig into it more though.

25
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,060
 I've stepped into about five functions. I think I'll do for now.

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,060
 So we'll move on to the next question.

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,060
 So Erin says, "How do stencils work?"

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,060
 I actually found a good guide to stencils in Unity, which helped me understand them inside Neos.

29
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:27,060
 So I looked for stencils from probable crime in our Discord. No, not pro scrub. I don't know who pro scrub is, but hooray.

30
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,060
 Is that the guide I meant? I don't know.

31
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,060
 This is the one that I previously linked to a few people. It's a guide about how stencil shaders work.

32
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:43,060
 It isn't directly applicable to Neos, but you can kind of figure it out if you are technically minded and you take a look at that.

33
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,060
 Additionally, do check a look at Visualibo's public folder. They've got a bunch of stencil stuff there.

34
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:56,060
 A variant of which is inside my meme or cheese folder, which is the cheese hole, that again is a stencil.

35
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:06,060
 They are like weird ways to write on top of or below the current render buffer, so you can do really cool stuff.

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,060
 It's similar to how portals and stuff work, although portals are usually just cameras these days.

37
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,060
 He wanted a link to Visualibo's public folder. Okay, let me see if I can get that as well.

38
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:24,060
 I feel like a weird data retrieval person right now, because my tax accountant is asking for 2022's documents today.

39
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:31,060
 I've spent three hours just downloading PDFs and documents from various places I don't remember my passwords for.

40
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
 So that's been fun.

41
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,060
 I need every document that has a single dollar sign on it ever. Please, please.

42
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
 Oh, Froppy's got it. Fantastic.

43
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,060
 We'll move on to the next question, depending on what you want to do, Aaron. Maybe I can help you out later.

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:55,060
 Fuzzy says, "Is there a way to edit something in Neos that has been baked already?"

45
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,060
 Depends what type of baking you're after.

46
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,060
 If you mean the sort of baking where you're baking a procedural mesh, you can't unbake a procedural mesh. Nope.

47
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:11,060
 If you mean an avatar into a static avatar like the statue maker, then again, nope. That's not possible.

48
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,060
 So it really does depend on what you mean explicitly, but usually the answer is no, you can't unbake it.

49
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,060
 You can take it to Blender and then do stuff there, resplit it apart.

50
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:31,060
 Do remember that if you export it with a type of model file that supports complex stuff, then you'll be able to do more than if you export it with something that does simple stuff.

51
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,060
 For example, if you export as SDL or OBJ, it will usually collapse the materials down to something sort of unusable.

52
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:44,060
 But if you use glTF, which I recommend, then you should be able to pull apart the different materials that exist up there.

53
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,060
 Those who are unaware, glTF for everything, please.

54
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,060
 If you have any issues with glTF, please do let me know because it worked for everything I could do.

55
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,060
 GLB is OK. Basically, if your file format starts in GL, you're totally fine.

56
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,060
 If it starts in FBX, come on guys, it's 2023. Let's make 2023 the year of the glTF.

57
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,060
 Ozi asks a good question actually. I read it really fast and now I have to read it out loud for the recording.

58
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,060
 Hey Prime, a bit of a cloud feature question, but from my understanding, the nearest cloud has a lot of moving parts and services.

59
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,060
 Is there any plans to expose the state of health of these individual services similar to how the other cloud-based services show such?

60
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:29,060
 I would love to do that. One of the initiatives I want to do once this whole mess, C announcements channel, is fixed is sort of up our transparency on stuff.

61
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,060
 Like there's of course stuff that we can't tell you, for example like legal stuff or anything like that,

62
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,060
 but there's a bunch of stuff that we just aren't telling you for just sort of like, we're just not, and we totally can.

63
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,060
 Examples there might be what percentage of the Patreon fund goes to paying for the servers? That's good information.

64
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,060
 We could even do what percentage goes to wages if we want to.

65
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,060
 That wouldn't be what individual people's wages were, that would just be like,

66
00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:00,060
 "Patreon, this percentage goes to the actual developers so they can buy cheese." It's all information that we can do.

67
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,060
 Of course, with each of those pieces of information, I have to get clearance from the rest of the team, and fruits of course, to share it,

68
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,060
 but there isn't anything preventing us from sharing some of that information.

69
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:17,060
 I always post this, and people get tired of it sometimes, but if you take a look at the platform Glimmish, Glimmish.tv,

70
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,060
 they're one of the streaming platforms for video game streaming that sprung up when Mixer died.

71
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,060
 They try and do everything as open as possible, so their board meetings are just entirely open, you can go watch a YouTube video of them,

72
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,060
 and I don't see why that can't happen with us. And then they share metrics.

73
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,060
 They share their daily active users, their monthly active users, how much money they made in t-shirt sales, how much money they made with subscriptions.

74
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,060
 And this is above and beyond what I think we'll be able to do, but there's no reason why we can't.

75
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,060
 So I'd like to see what we can do in that regard. So hopefully server status will be included in that.

76
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,060
 So Rickerbus asks what normals are, and a few people answered below.

77
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:02,060
 So Lou said normals are textures, that's a normal map, not normals.

78
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,060
 Normal maps are a way of mapping normal data into an image.

79
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,060
 So, how to explain this about visuals.

80
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,060
 Okay, so if you shine a light at a mirror, let's say a laser actually, that's a bit better.

81
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:25,060
 A laser at a mirror, it will reflect off of that mirror, according to a certain mathematical calculation that we have determined.

82
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:32,060
 So if you do that in the real world with a laser pointer, if you've got one, I have one, long story, it'll just work, right?

83
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,060
 But in computing and in games, we need to write code and maths to make that work.

84
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:44,060
 And part of what we need to know there is the normal, which is sort of like the way that the surface of the object points.

85
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,060
 So if you think of that mirror, the normal of the mirror is straight back towards you.

86
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,060
 That's the normal of that mirror, because it's a flat rectangular surface pointing directly at you.

87
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,060
 The normal of that surface is straight back at you.

88
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,060
 However, let's think about the normal of maybe a sphere, right?

89
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:11,060
 That's complicated, because for each point that you hit in the sphere, it's got to then bounce straight back up towards you from every point.

90
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:22,060
 And that's complicated. So if you go into Blender, you can go ahead and just add a sphere, and then exactly exactly exactly what Froppy has posted for a sphere.

91
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,060
 So that's the normal for a sphere.

92
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:33,060
 So the normal map then encodes that data from your texture creating application or your baking application into an image, which then saves the data.

93
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,060
 Because we don't need so much data in the actual mesh, we can use it from the normal map.

94
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:47,060
 So for example, on Froppy's visual there, you'll see that there is quite large quads, like for example, the quad right in the middle of it.

95
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,060
 Just pick any of the quads right in the middle of it.

96
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,060
 There is only one normal for that quad.

97
00:08:51,060 --> 00:09:01,060
 But if you have a normal map with an appropriate UV, you could have, I don't know, 10, 20, 30, 50 normal values for that quad that is in the middle of that sphere.

98
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:09,060
 And that's why you might get, I don't know, a divot or a raised part, like maybe it's been roughed up with some sandpaper or something.

99
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:17,060
 And that's why when you combine all of that together, you get normal maps, which allow you to make surfaces rough or patchy and stuff like that.

100
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:25,060
 Do take a look inside the Neosessentials materials, and then just pick something that you wouldn't think would have normal.

101
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,060
 So pick metal or something like that.

102
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,060
 And then try one of the really rusted metals in there and look at its normal map.

103
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,060
 And then look at it on a flat surface like a quad.

104
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,060
 And then you'll start seeing, remove the normal, add the normal, you'll start seeing what's going on there.

105
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:45,060
 Moving forward, the programmer says, "Is there a way to save the texture of a material back to the computer?"

106
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,060
 Yeah, sure. So if you grab the texture, and you need to make sure you grab the texture itself.

107
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,060
 So like drag it out from the inspector or something.

108
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,060
 Like if you grab like a quad that has the texture on it, then that might not work.

109
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,060
 So make sure it's like the texture itself.

110
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,060
 Like as an example here, if you bring in an image and then you grab the image, that's the texture itself.

111
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,060
 Like it's, but if you put that image on another object, then that might not work.

112
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,060
 If you want more on that, I'll make a video or something.

113
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:18,060
 Anyway, you grab the image itself, you go to the file browser, and then you hit like the plus in the file browser.

114
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
 That'll let you save it.

115
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,060
 There's also, depending on the component setup, it's a exportable component.

116
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,060
 There'll be like export in the context menu, that's usually for screenshots and things like that.

117
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,060
 It'll be able to export that image back there.

118
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:38,060
 Same with meshes, again, grab the mesh, go to the file browser, hit plus, select glTF.

119
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,060
 Moving forwards, I found there's a tween node. This is from Tiki, sorry.

120
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,060
 I found there's a tween node to transition from one value to another, and it seemed very interesting to drive a float for some effects,

121
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,060
 but the output seems to be only possible on a component variables and not a generic register.

122
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,060
 It's another node that would work around, so I don't need to create a component.

123
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,060
 I thought tween would work for registers. I don't know why it wouldn't.

124
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:07,060
 I'm not in Neos right now, but if anyone is inside Neos, could you try making a tween node and targeting a value register?

125
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,060
 Thanks, that should work.

126
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:14,060
 If it doesn't work, you can also inspect the register in the inspector and find the component which represents the register,

127
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,060
 and then just tween the value of the register from the component version of the register.

128
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,060
 Because remember, Logix is just components with squares.

129
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
 Ogeba says, what is the maximum number of trackers Neos can use?

130
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,060
 There isn't a limit. There probably is a limit. It probably is close to a binary number, I think like 32, 64, 128, something like that.

131
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:40,060
 But you'd probably run out of body space before you run out of trackers inside Neos.

132
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,060
 The reason I say that is because at a certain point they'll start overlapping in terms of their dots and stuff,

133
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,060
 and then the base stations will get confused or whatever.

134
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,060
 11 point tracking is all we recommend for avatars, but you can add additional trackers to track things such as,

135
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,060
 someone has a drink tracker, someone had a cat tracker, someone in the really, really, really early days of Neos had a chair tracker,

136
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:10,060
 which I thought was brilliant. They put one on their desk chair, and then they knew where their chair was if they needed to sit down in VR.

137
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,060
 And I've had that problem where I don't know where my chair is, and I've had a couple of close calls with the floor.

138
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,060
 You know, you keep lowering your butt and you're like, that's not a chair, that's not a chair, that's not a chair,

139
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,060
 and at some point you're like, I'm going to fall over if I keep going. Let me double check where my chair is.

140
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,060
 So they did that. Random anecdote here, we do have time though.

141
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:37,060
 I saw on a TV show called Station 19, which is a firefighter show, which was spun off from Grey's Anatomy,

142
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,060
 they were doing firefighter training where they had the nozzle of a firefighter's hose, a fake one of course,

143
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:49,060
 but it had a vive tracker on the end of it, so they could track where the nozzle was.

144
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,060
 And I was like, cool. That's actually what people at Vive thought that you would use vive trackers for.

145
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,060
 They thought that you would be adding it to objects such as firefighter hoses, tools, maybe even sort of, you know,

146
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,060
 mock weapons, et cetera, for training and management, et cetera.

147
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,060
 And then VRChat and Social VR came along and was like, we're going to put like 11 of them on us,

148
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:15,060
 and then lie in front of a mirror for 12 hours. And Vive's like, what?

149
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,060
 And that's why sometimes when you're like, Vive stuff seems a bit weird.

150
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,060
 That's because they clearly were targeting a more professional market to start with.

151
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:29,060
 That's also why the Vive ones exist and are really bad. We're targeting a non-gaming market by looks of things.

152
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:35,060
 Anyway, moving forwards, Kazu says, for import of GLTF data, and you know,

153
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,060
 sometimes it emits shape keys from the original data with this mechanism. Also sometimes Neos emits necessary shape keys.

154
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:47,060
 How to disable this emitting heuristics. I'm not sure. We'll have to get a Neos GitHub issue on that one with a model that has that issue.

155
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,060
 And then I can run it through the importer whilst adding some debug stuff.

156
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,060
 Rampa says that, I mentioned that FBX is a fossil. The problem is that people are used to Unity.

157
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,060
 Unity does FBX. Yeah, I get it. Like, Unity does FBX. But when you're doing like, Neos stuff,

158
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:10,060
 what I want you to do is when you export from Blender or something, take like a split second and be like, hmm, FBX? No. GLTF.

159
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:16,060
 Skant says, for meshes exporting, you need to grab the slot, right? There are like seven different ways to export a mesh.

160
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,060
 And sometimes you literally get the mesh export dialog exported.

161
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:28,060
 And it's a sort of running joke or problem because every time Fruxereye adds an additional way to export mesh,

162
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,060
 someone else finds an additional way to export the mesh exported dialog. And it does get frustrating.

163
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,060
 Like sometimes I'll get the mesh orb. That's the green orb with the mesh inside it.

164
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,060
 Sometimes I'll get the mesh exported dialog. A couple of times I've got some tools.

165
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:51,060
 Just try grabbing, if in doubt, find the static mesh component, grab that component and export that. That should work.

166
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,060
 Interesting that the tween node doesn't accept registers. If someone could make that a bug on the GitHub, that would be good.

167
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,060
 I'm certain that that is a bug.

168
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,060
 So a group of us says, how does peer-to-peer networking system works?

169
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,060
 Rooters don't let other computers connect to my computer. How does Neos make that possible?

170
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:13,060
 So Neos uses UDP for like most of its main core networking.

171
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,060
 That isn't for like downloading assets or messages or anything like that.

172
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:23,060
 But if you're in a session and you're looking at me, talking to me or handing me an object, that's going over UDP.

173
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:34,060
 So UDP is the, I don't want to say newer because I don't know, but it is newer than the traditional TCP, transfer control protocol.

174
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,060
 This stuff's all kind of like computer science-y weirdness stuff.

175
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,060
 Essentially, TCP is like more controlled. It's like a conversation.

176
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,060
 You're like, ah, yes, I would like the next packet, please, waiter.

177
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,060
 And then the server's like, here you go. It's the cheeseburger you ordered. Please eat it.

178
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,060
 Whereas UDP is basically people screaming.

179
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,060
 Like you just go into a room, there's people just screaming and projectile vomiting everywhere. That's UDP.

180
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,060
 So that's UDP. So that's the first benefit that we get there is UDP.

181
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:12,060
 And then what we do there is we put UDP over what's called NAT punch through or universal plug and play stuff.

182
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:21,060
 And what that can do is it can sort of set up a way to get through your router's port forwarding and stuff like that, such that you don't need it.

183
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:31,060
 If that doesn't work or your router is incompatible with that, then we also do what's called UDP relay, where we go via a relay server.

184
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,060
 So your computer receives the UDP stuff from a relay server.

185
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,060
 You can find out more information about that on the network information page.

186
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:46,060
 I made a pig's ear of explaining that because it's very complicated.

187
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,060
 But here you go. Networking information. You can see all the information there.

188
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:58,060
 People often ask like, what port? And it's like, whatever port works. Networking is very complicated.

189
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,060
 I'm so glad the days of port forwarding are behind us though. It's good.

190
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:09,060
 I do hope at some point we'll be able to move forwards with Steam networking sockets for like everyone.

191
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,060
 I know some people don't like those or something. I don't know. We'll figure it out.

192
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,060
 All right, moving down, making sure we're not missing any questions.

193
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,060
 Froppy posted the cat tracking video. Thank you.

194
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:24,060
 So Svekn says, "Am I right in thinking that drives aren't really affected by desync but impulses and writes are?"

195
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,060
 Yes. Okay. So I've been trying to explain this in a way that makes sense for a long time.

196
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,060
 Each time I do it, I try and get a little bit better at doing it, so I'll try again.

197
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:41,060
 Drives are local. And so it's the equivalent of, let's say, the server host to the session host telling your computer,

198
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:50,060
 "This cat that is spinning is spinning at this speed. Take care of it. Don't talk to me about it. Don't inform me about it.

199
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,060
 Don't tell me about it. Just keep the cat spinning at this speed."

200
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,060
 And that would be the spinner, right? The spinner is a drive component.

201
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:03,060
 That doesn't have any network traffic, right? For the rest of time, your computer is like, "All right, I'm going to make the cat spin."

202
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:11,060
 Until such time as maybe you, as a Logix developer, you write the enabled property to false using an impulse.

203
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:17,060
 At that point, there needs to be a network packet that goes from the person that initiated that write or that impulse

204
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:23,060
 through the server host and then back down to you, which says, "Yo, bro, stop spinning the cat."

205
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,060
 And then your computer is like, "Okay, I've stopped spinning the cat." That's the difference there.

206
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,060
 So desync isn't affected by that. But the control signals for those drives are.

207
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:39,060
 For example, if you're desynced, that "please stop the cat spinning right" packet might not come through

208
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:47,060
 because it's queued behind, I don't know, 5,000 other packets that are more there.

209
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,060
 I hope that made sense. If it didn't, I don't know. Ask again. I'll try again.

210
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,060
 Lou, let me just double check. I haven't missed any questions before. Lou's question, I haven't.

211
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:03,060
 So, oh, Specs does say that glTF will darken vertex colors. Do you know if that's glTF itself,

212
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,060
 or is that something Neos is doing? If that's something Neos is doing, make sure there's a bug open up on our GitHub.

213
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:13,060
 We'll take a look at vertex colors. If it's something glTF is doing, then maybe we can detect vertex colors on glTF

214
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:21,060
 and brighten them inside Neos. I don't know. More information, GitHub was, if there is already one, great.

215
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:27,060
 I don't know if there's actually one. So Lou's question says, when teaching new users about things that involve the dashboard,

216
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,060
 we're usually leading blindly. Is there a way to show a mirror of the dashboard in world space like the latency inventory?

217
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,060
 There is not, but what you can actually do, and some people have done for parts of the dash,

218
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:44,060
 is you can kind of export that dash into world space as a copy of it. Lots of stuff won't work, but the visuals will.

219
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,060
 And so you can basically be like, this is your dash, this is what it looks like.

220
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,060
 You can also take videos and pictures and stuff like that to kind of help.

221
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,060
 There is not a way to show it, like, your actual dash inside world.

222
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,060
 Tiki says, in telephony, stun and ice are usually used for networking.

223
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,060
 I have heard so much about stun and ice for a long time. I don't want to know.

224
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,060
 You can look them up. There are networking protocols used for telephoning.

225
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,060
 Moving forwards, I'm Aaron says, do you think there will ever be the functionality to transfer hosts to another player?

226
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,060
 Yes, there is a GitHub issue open for that. Go ahead and look for it.

227
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,060
 Arigabus asks, is there a way I can check my messages and neos without opening neos, like a web interface or something?

228
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,060
 There is not an official one. There are some community-made things that will allow you to do that.

229
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,060
 I can't vouch for them. I haven't used them. I don't know how they work. I haven't read their code.

230
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:37,060
 But not currently. We do have plans for one in the future, but we don't have one currently.

231
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,060
 I'd like to get it to the point where we have a similar web UI to VR chats, hopefully better.

232
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:48,060
 I'd like it to be similar in some respects to Steam's, but you don't have to go to a website. It's like an application.

233
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,060
 It's like, here, people are here, people are here. You can talk to them.

234
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,060
 All sorts of stuff like that. I'd love to get that in the future.

235
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,060
 Kazu says, update Blender to see if the glTF is better there.

236
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,060
 glTF is a new standard, so there are people that are doing it more and more.

237
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,060
 For example, the glTF standard is why VRMs exist.

238
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,060
 VRMs are basically just syntaxical sugar on top of the glTF spec.

239
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:18,060
 And the glTF spec, by the way, has, like, it can have behaviour in it.

240
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:24,060
 It's not just models and armature and blend shapes. It can have behaviour in it and lights and cameras. It's really cool.

241
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,060
 There's also this other thing, like sometimes you'll see it when you download from Sketchfab.

242
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,060
 It's like another file format. I don't know anything about it.

243
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,060
 I don't even know if Blender or Neo supports it.

244
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,060
 I'll try and get its name. I need to log into Sketchfab to get that.

245
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,060
 I'll log in with Google on Sketchfab. Yeah, I do.

246
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,060
 Welcome to Prime Time, where I log into Sketchfab.

247
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,060
 Yeah, USDZ. Universal Scene Description.

248
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,060
 Don't know anything about it, but something it's new and cool to.

249
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,060
 Tiki talks about ice and stone and turn not being used yet. Probably not.

250
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,060
 You can take a look at network information for all the information there. If you've got more questions, please let me know.

251
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,060
 Zvekin says, "Is it the USDZ?" Yeah, it is. It's the USDZ. Yeah.

252
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,060
 I don't know anything about it. I just know that it's also on Sketchfab and that Sketchfab were trying to push it at a certain point.

253
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
 So, yeah.

254
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,060
 Oh, I missed a question from Skant. I'm sorry. Let me take a look.

255
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,060
 Oh, I did. I did. Yeah, it didn't have the question emoji when I went through it last time.

256
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:24,060
 "Does Neo see a VPN network like Tailscale or Zero-Tiers local networks?" I don't know.

257
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,060
 I'll go ahead and try it. I'm not quite sure how LAN works in that regard.

258
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,060
 I want to try Hamachi. Someone should try Hamachi.

259
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,060
 Sometimes when I think of Hamachi, I think of Hibachi, which is the food restaurant.

260
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,060
 Let's do Hibachi.

261
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
 Anyway, moving forwards.

262
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:49,060
 Rigby says, "Is there a way I can block someone's avatar? Sometimes people join with avatars, lots of shaders, and my FPS goes to zero."

263
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,060
 Not currently, but there is a user-to-user blocking system which is on our feature list.

264
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:02,060
 And that will be more for sort of moderation, personal space, harassment reasons, rather than performance reasons.

265
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,060
 I'm not sure on our current reasoning about performance blocking.

266
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:13,060
 I haven't spoken to any of the team about performance blocking features that are similar to VRChat.

267
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:20,060
 For those who are unaware who maybe don't use VRChat, there is a performance blocking system there whereby

268
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:30,060
 if an avatar is at a certain limit in terms of mesh, shaders, renderers, materials, particle effects, and stuff like that,

269
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,060
 you can elect to not see it.

270
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:39,060
 And I have my settings on very high, and 95% of the avatars on VRChat are not rendered, so it's really fun.

271
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,060
 But there we go. Maybe that will be a feature in the future.

272
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,060
 A feature in the future, not a future in the future.

273
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,060
 I'll have to look through the GitHub and see if there's anything open about that.

274
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,060
 Specs says that Blender 3.4 might have fixed the vertex colors.

275
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,060
 That's a really short fix. I have no idea on the context, but it sounds good.

276
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:05,060
 Kazi says VRM is compatible with GTF, so they've been telling people to rename VRM to GLTF and try and put it into Neos.

277
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
 That's a good thing, yeah, that might work.

278
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,060
 Tiki asks, there is a normal scale slider in most materials but couldn't figure out how to make it work.

279
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
 I don't see any change in normal heights while changing it.

280
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:21,060
 That slider might not be big enough, so try typing in a really large number and a really small number and seeing if there's any changes.

281
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
 I have definitely seen changes.

282
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,060
 Usually what it'll do is make things look really, really weird at a certain place, and then you know you've got sort of the sweet spot.

283
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,060
 And again, try it with some of the CC0 materials that we've got inside Neos Essentials, because those have really good normals.

284
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:43,060
 Rigabet says, does Neos use mono or .NET cores at C# runtime? It uses mono as part of Unity, unfortunately.

285
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:59,060
 We would love to not be dependent on mono, we would love to be free to do all the cool new C# stuff, but we are stuck on C# .NET Framework 4.7.2 or 4.7.6, I can never remember which, because Unity is stuck on that one.

286
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:05,060
 4.6.2, you see, I can never remember which way around it is, like 4.7, 4.6, I know it's 4-something.

287
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,060
 When I need to check, I just right-click the project in Visual Studio and I go like, "Here, what are you again?"

288
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,060
 And it's like, "Yeah, I'm 4.6.2." It's like, "Thank you for telling me I will forget this in three seconds."

289
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:23,060
 Seeing the Hibachi GIF above from Fuzzy reminds me to remind you all, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch the film Everything, Everywhere, all at once.

290
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:30,060
 And you'll eventually see a hanamachi scene, which is really good, and won't make any sense without you seeing the film.

291
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
 So please go look at the film, it's a good film.

292
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,060
 Rampa doesn't want to throw dirt, but Unity not only has bad rap, but I feel it's more duct tape together with each version.

293
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:47,060
 The problem there is stability. What they need is, they've got so many moving parts that they need to keep working, and that's why they are down-rev.

294
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:53,060
 If you think that's bad, remember that there are still many, many organizations on the planet that require Internet Explorer 6.

295
00:25:53,060 --> 00:26:07,060
 Even though 6 is just completely gone, 7's gone, 11's gone, I remember having weird arguments with the web dev team, like the front-end team at Mixer, about our support of Internet Explorer 11.

296
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:16,060
 I'm like, "You know, like, 1% use it or something?" And they're like, "Show me the data." And I'm like, "Okay, 1% of our viewers use 11. Can we just drop it, please?"

297
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,060
 At a certain point, what you have to do in web dev, especially in web front-end, is basically be like, "No."

298
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:27,060
 Because if you're like, "Yes," then you start going like, "Oh, but we don't support Safari Mobile 2!"

299
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:32,060
 "One person who lives in the middle of nowhere uses that, don't worry about it."

300
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:38,060
 You can always go to, where are we, caniuse.com, is it? Yeah, caniuse.com.

301
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:43,060
 That shows you if you can use various browser features. It even has a browser usage table.

302
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:50,060
 Ramper points out that ActiveX is the reason why IE6 is being used. Yep, ActiveX is. ActiveX is really insecure. That's cool.

303
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:56,060
 I was reading some messages from someone the other day that said that they were using a DOS program at work.

304
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,060
 And this is like a big company that they work with. I won't tell you what company it is or anything like that, but you know,

305
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,060
 it's a big company that they worked at, they needed to use a DOS program.

306
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:10,060
 So Rigibus says, "Actually, we're bad on time here, so Ramper, Lax, and Tiki, if you have a question, go for it, otherwise we'll go ahead and stop."

307
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:17,060
 Kazu will also add you to that, because I was mid-saying. So any more questions other than those people? Nope, we are running out of time.

308
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,060
 So Rigibus has a question which says, "How does the voice transmission component of Neos work?

309
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:28,060
 Is it like Discord with Web or to see a WebSocket? So what type of data does it transmit? Is it pieces of an audio file?" No.

310
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:38,060
 So the voices are an Opus stream. And again, streams are literally like walking into a room and everyone's vomiting data everywhere.

311
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:50,060
 It's not transactional. WebSockets are transactional, WebRTC is not, it's Opus stream. Over that UDP.

312
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:58,060
 Lexis, "Speech to text for browsers is Chrome only." Interesting. What can I use for that?

313
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:08,060
 Speech recognition, "Method to provide speech input in web browser." It is partially supported everywhere.

314
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,060
 And not supported everywhere else. It's only partially supported in Chrome, wow. So yeah, no one really supports that.

315
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:20,060
 Speech synthesis though, everywhere except IE supports that. Or Opera Mobile doesn't support it.

316
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,060
 So you know, if you use Opera Mobile, it uses that.

317
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,060
 Speech to text is also supported by Edge. Well, Edge is Chrome, so yeah.

318
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:38,060
 No, it says, uh, Edge speech recognition, Edge version 108 does not support it. Maybe that's out of date, I don't know.

319
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:43,060
 I haven't looked at, uh, can I use in a long time, because I don't really do much web development these days.

320
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,060
 Anyway, that is all the questions that I have got here.

321
00:28:46,060 --> 00:29:01,060
 On another note of DOS and ActiveX and old software, take a look into what happened with Southwest. Southwest did a bad bad during the winter storm in America and cancelled like 2,000 flights or something.

322
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:08,060
 It was a complete mess. And the reason behind that is that their scheduling software was incredibly ancient and just couldn't cope with the load.

323
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,060
 So look into that if you want to hear horror stories about how out of date software is.

324
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,060
 Other than that, yep, I will see you again next week. I'll be processing the notes and recording.

325
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:26,060
 I'm using, just a shout out here, I'm using Lex Super Cool Script to process all the Office Server stuff now that Sounder has shut down. Very annoying.

326
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:31,060
 That does mean, however, that we are not on any podcasting platforms or Spotify or RSS feeds right now.

327
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:40,060
 I'll also be making slight edits to Lex's script such that we don't have the naming issues we had last week, but you have already fixed them. I don't know, I'm just going to make it anyway.

328
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:49,060
 I'm looking for an alternative source, but whilst this current issue exists, like it's just, the Wiki seems like the place to go.

329
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,060
 Once we start getting back into the swing of things, maybe we'll do something else.

330
00:29:53,060 --> 00:30:02,060
 Like I would love for these office hours, for example, and for Canadian Gits Office Hours to be actually uploaded to an official Neos channel.

331
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,060
 Like maybe there's an official Neos presence on Spotify or other podcasting platforms and all of the office hours go there.

332
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:19,060
 You could go there and be like, yo, give me Prime's office hours, give me the moderation office hours, give me the Workshop Wednesday stream, the Friday stream, just like, wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

333
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:30,060
 Anyway, I will see you guys next week. Spotify is just like, it's a podcast aggregator, right? It'll collect it from wherever the hell it is. Like you can listen to other platforms.

334
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:37,060
 It's just an example. When I say Spotify, I mean like streaming things. Anyway, see you next week.

335
00:30:37,060 --> 00:31:06,940
