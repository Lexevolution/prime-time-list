00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello everyone, welcome to office hours for the 8th of the 11th, 2022. Is it the 8th already? Damn it. Okay.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So we're going to get started with some questions that we've already got. Please put questions in the thread that's been created and I'll get to them as soon as I can.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sorry for the sniffles today. It appears I have a cold.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So Specs ask, while I know Neos updates are on hold, I'm curious if you or someone else on the team has investigated the Quest Pro's face and eye-tracking implementations.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Do they seem to differ significantly from vibes? No one has looked at that to my knowledge, although Geens owns one, so maybe they'll tinker around and take a look.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ozzy has a question here which says, it's like a question that they asked yesterday in questions, but despite trying to test it with Headless, I could not figure out how World Path works properly.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Can you go into more detail about it if possible? Namely how to use it with Headless.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, because I don't know. I'd have to dig it up and make sure I get documentation on it, but like Lex said, records, which is actually what we call worlds, avatars, models, gadgets, whatever it is that you save to your inventory, it's called a record, and worlds are also records.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They have a path, and if you know that path, you can use it in various ways, so World Path lets you sort of overwrite the path of that world, and you can pick that up.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a little bit like the custom session ID property that you can do, where you can have a static session ID using custom session ID.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Those are really cool for actually the MMC voting world. I have a Headless server where I just start it up, and because that custom session ID never changes, all the gadgets and stuff I've made to link to that world still work.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will make a note to dig into that one, but I'm not going to stumble through it today. I've just written it down on my notepad in about size 80 font, because I couldn't reach my notepad, and I don't really care how big I read it.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There we go, I can read that. Cool. Moving forwards.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Iregubus says, why spawning a camera makes my FPS drop a lot?

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, that's just because the camera is rendering. If you're not looking at the camera, then again, it's probably because the camera is still rendering.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It shouldn't be that impactful.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
When you say drops a lot, do you mean like a few? 5, 10, 20?

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It will drop a bit, though, because it's like re-rendering the scene for that camera.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Particularly if it's like a 4K camera. I've seen a lot of people doing that.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You know the mirrors with the customizable resolution? Those have got like 8K on them, and I've seen people that set them to 8K and then complain about their FPS, and it's just like, well, you have an 8K mirror, so maybe drop it to 4K, you probably won't notice the difference.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, it might render twice, I'm not sure.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A good actual test would be trying a portal as well. So if you do create new object portal, a portal is like a stereoscopic camera, so see what your FPS goes to with that.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:16,000
By stereoscopic, we mean different view for each eye, by the way, sorry, like scientific words, sometimes good, sometimes bad, so I'll clarify them.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Random fact of the day, the smallest camera resolution you can go to is 4x4. No, wait, 2x2, it might be 4x4 or 2x2, I don't know anymore.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I did know, and then I started talking, and now I don't.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's it for questions, I see people typing, until people paste their questions.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The color sampler node, that does the smallest resolution camera that is possible. I double checked the code on that before I put out the sample color tutorial.

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That sample color tutorial was, I don't know why these things come in waves, but it seems like when I recorded that, like everyone was asking about it,

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and I was just getting barraged at questions where people were like, it doesn't work on videos.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm not sure it does, it doesn't work on skyboxes, pretty sure it does.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's why that video is basically just like every object type sample color works.

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I haven't opened the code base today, but I should, so I'm going to go ahead and open it.

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Zach asks, will you spook by someone being in your world that you made private while you're making a presentation?

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, no, there's a difference in my head at least, with making a presentation or delivering a presentation.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So yes, I am working a presentation for Friday, it should actually be up on YouTube as well,

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
there'll be a three minute presentation on some projects we're doing at an event.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The event is public, but I would link it, but it's basically going to be six minutes of Neos.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We've got two projects that are using Neos, and then three to four to five hours of stuff that doesn't involve Neos,

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and is mostly about sort of opening up people's faces and putting in metal plates and stuff, it's really gross.

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So cool, but I'll put the videos up when I can get them up.

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The other project I'll have to get permission for, but my presentation is my presentation, I'll just put it on YouTube.

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The general rule of thumb for my worlds is if it's open, it's meant to be open,

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and if you come in and it wasn't actually meant to be open, that's my fault, that's not your fault, that's my fault.

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I might still ask you politely to leave, but I should never be mad at you.

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's the equivalent of people leaving their blinds open and then complaining that people are looking through their windows.

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I understand if I'm camped out in front of someone's house with binoculars or something,

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
but if I'm just walking past, right, I should fight.

48
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's move forward.

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Arugaba says, how do I move objects around my inventory? You can't.

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I just posted a weird and complicated way of doing it, but you can't natively right now.

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Now, whenever I see people complaining about that, whilst I do understand, and I do emphasise,

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
if you, when you're watching YouTube videos inside Neos doing absolutely nothing,

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
if you manually move one item a day, then in ten days you'll have moved ten items to their correct location,

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and in a hundred days you'll have moved a hundred items.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you can move them, it's just really complicated right now.

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You have to spawn the item, go to the place where you'd like it to be, resave the item to that folder,

57
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
go back to the original location once your sink has been synced, and then delete it from your location.

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have a video on my channel about how I organise my inventory,

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and I've seen being very rigid and strict on that has worked,

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
such that I don't really have many issues,

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
but I do have dump locations such as the root of the inventory and a temp folder.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I recommend a temp folder because that means that the root of your inventory isn't fooled with stuff,

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and it means that you can just go into that temp folder whenever you need to just quickly save something,

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
go into that temp folder.

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Moving forward, Zach says, someone claims they spooked you because their booper made a sound,

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and you turn it around extremely fast. That happens all the time.

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Generically, if you have sounds on your avatar, I hate them because they're always done wrong.

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Not always, like I'm not saying for you particularly, I'm saying for the collective you,

69
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and the entire community, it's like I have a booper, it makes a noise in the global audio space at 500,000 volume,

70
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and yeah, I'm going to be startled by that.

71
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Make sure you're using appropriately volumed and distanced audio on your voice.

72
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you.

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Nigabah says, does voice messages count in the storage space? Yes, they can in your storage space.

74
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Additionally, if you're having sync issues, voice messages might get stuck as well.

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So I do recommend voice messages because they're cool, but kind of don't at the same time

76
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because there's no way to sort of delete them after the fact, so they can build up.

77
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, root of the inventory is just make a temp folder, right, make a temp folder,

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and that way when you know that you want to go take a look at your shame and your mess,

79
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you can go into the temp folder, but otherwise you have a clean root inventory.

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Just do it right now if you're in the US. Open up your inventory, make a folder called TMP,

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
whatever you want to call it, just that's where you save stuff where you don't know where it goes.

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Theo asks, so they're clear with their Quake 3 spawn sounds.

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If they're local, reasonably volumed, and yeah, sure, oh, yes.

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Rigobus has another question, which is, is it safe to delete the entire Neos cache folder after it gets too big? Yes.

85
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But ensure that you are deleting the cache and not the local database.

86
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You can clear the local database, but that has different implications for clearing the cache.

87
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There are two folders. You can find out more about them at a lovely Wiki article,

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
which a certain someone wrote. I don't know if you know their name.

89
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Probably. Yeah, that linked for you. Yeah.

90
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So you want to be deleting the cache and not the database. You can delete the database, of course,

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
if you would like to, but do follow the guide there because I'd rather you didn't, basically.

92
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But I know that some people need to occasionally. I answered the Quake one. Let's move forwards.

93
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Zari says, I have some tidbits of the awesome Edu stuff you've worked on.

94
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Is a lot of that private to the institution or is there someplace to explore those?

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Some of it's private for like patient privacy reasons.

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Some of it's private from like busyness and some of it's private from laziness.

97
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So it's sort of a mix there. I am trying to be like exceptionally public

98
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
about the jaw reconstruction stuff I'm doing because there's no real reason to hide it.

99
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Particularly now I've replaced all the patient data with just 3D artist stuff.

100
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So we'll see. Like I said, the talk I'm giving on it on Friday, I should be able to make public.

101
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So I'll just shove that on YouTube when I can. I'm going to scroll back through my pictures

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and find a very particular picture. Yes, here you go.

103
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Welcome to jaw land.

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Additionally, because there's something like cute about it,

105
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm going to link this video for you guys as well.

106
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So I'm doing this presentation on Friday at an event.

107
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I wanted to make a slide deck. And so I made a slide deck that was boring

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and then I brought it into Neos and added visual assets for it.

109
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So at this point in the video that I just linked, my headset's on the floor.

110
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm done practicing for a while, but for some reason I'm still recording because

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't know, I'm recording the clip. Yeah, that makes sense.

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So I'm not even paying attention to what's going on on my screen.

113
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I think I was making tea at the time or something.

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But I came back and I just watched these two animated individuals just play.

115
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Because whilst I'm talking about the slide that's on view there, they're just doing their stuff.

116
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There's a camera anchor that's green in the middle there, which will be where the camera is during it.

117
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And it's just like, I don't know. I was mesmerized by how cool it was.

118
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, the little people in my computer.

119
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We're really trying to sell the difference in the educational sector from 360 degree videos,

120
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
which lots of people in the sector call VR and actual VR, where there is space

121
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
that you can move through and interact with.

122
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And so lots of my slides for that presentation have animated stuff on them.

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That one is just like tip top. That one, I had the idea really late at night.

124
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm going to do it. Tony says,

125
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Not a question, but I had to clear my local DBs since downloads were extremely slow after clearing it.

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Stuff was downloading at full speed. Yeah, I don't even know what's up with that one.

127
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We've got to look into that more. There is a bit of a show about that one.

128
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's really weird. That's why I say if you want to clear your database, knock yourself out.

129
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But don't continually do it. I've seen people that clear it every day because they think

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that's just how you keep Neos working. And the answer is no.

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's a really bad way to keep Neos working.

132
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's the equivalent of cleaning your oven out or your chimneys or your sink

133
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
or the toilet cleaning that every day. It's just weird. Don't do it.

134
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Like a full deep clean. I know that there's some people, myself included,

135
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
that will give it a wipe around every day.

136
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But you get out the frothy, super duper ultra bleach cleaner and drain the sink and that.

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No. We actually have a few TV shows in the UK which followed around Clean Freaks.

138
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't remember what it was called, but they basically took Clean Freaks and then put them into dirty houses.

139
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There was one episode where they took them all to this big manor house that just wasn't that clean.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They freaked out over the smallest thing. The chandelier had cobwebs on it.

141
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I remember this lady screaming and running out the room because there were cobwebs on the chandelier.

142
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Also, what's the difference between a spider web in your house and a cobweb? I don't know.

143
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
On the top of my head, a cobweb is when dust has settled on the web.

144
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So it's not really a functional web for the spider anymore. It's just dust and spider web.

145
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
These clean people bleach the toilet every day, vacuum every day.

146
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I think there was one that steamed the curtains every day.

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We have actual nearest questions rather than talking about cleaning houses all day. Excellent.

148
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Easton asks what do you think about AI writing? I've been playing around with the opening to Playground.

149
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's really impressive. I had it write multiple SpongeBob episodes. Interesting.

150
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I get a little bogged down by AI, to be honest.

151
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's usually a channel on a lot of Discords that I'm in where they just post AI art.

152
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And I mute those and try and get no notifications from those.

153
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Or if the server doesn't have a dedicated AI art channel, I ask them to make one.

154
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Because it can resemble the same problem as like TikTok or YouTube Shorts

155
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
where it's just like an endless supply of stuff.

156
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And at a certain point, you're just looking at it to look at it, not looking at it for any purpose.

157
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So it's just like, it's weird. It is cool. I'm sure I would use it in some cases.

158
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But I don't like playing with it. There needs to be a use for it.

159
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I know you're talking mostly about AI writing. So again, there has to be a use for it.

160
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm not going to go play with it just for the sake of playing.

161
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Am I going there to generate images I need for inspiration? That's a use.

162
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Am I going there for inspiration for actual writing? Yes.

163
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Am I going there because I'm making an open world survival game akin to Skyrim

164
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and I need a bunch of books to place within the world?

165
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's a perfectly good reason for AI writing, as far as I'm aware.

166
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But am I going there to do a bunch of AI writing because I don't want to do my dishes,

167
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
vacuum my floor, clean my sink or go to bed? Then that's a problem.

168
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm trying to reduce the amount of times where that occurs.

169
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Otherwise, you know, you're watching YouTube Shorts for like three hours in bed

170
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and you're just like, I don't know what time, date or planet I'm on right now,

171
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
but I should really sleep. I think it was Fur.

172
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah, Fur was saying to me yesterday that they installed a third party YouTube app

173
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
on their phone, which still works with regular YouTube, just so that Shorts weren't on their phone.

174
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Probably going to do that. A friend back in my university days,

175
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
they bought an ancient, it wasn't ancient, I think it was brand new,

176
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
but they bought a wind-up alarm clock.

177
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And the reason they bought the alarm clock is because they were just tired of using a phone.

178
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
They're like, it's just not working. You know, it goes wrong. It's not charged.

179
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There's apps on there I don't want. When I sleep, I just want an alarm clock that rings

180
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and that's all it does. So they bought a mechanical alarm clock.

181
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And it worked really well, except for if they forgot to wind it.

182
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Thank you, Scary. That's actually really good to know.

183
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm going to install one of those, yeah.

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I uninstalled a bunch of apps that shouldn't be on my phone anyway.

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Let's be honest, right? Most phone apps are just for wasting time.

186
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, we have a question I missed. I'm so sorry.

187
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, I totally missed that one. I was just about to ask if there's any more questions.

188
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How do I save world orbs? The option is always grayed out even on public worlds.

189
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And I can only create a session orb, but wouldn't a session orb just link to a session?

190
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes, it would. And then you have your answer there, which is you have to select new session

191
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
in the expanded world view, and then you can get a world orb there and save it.

192
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I will now paranoidly scroll for more questions just in case I've missed them by talking about

193
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
mobile phones and cobwebs for too long. Ah, Tiki has a good question.

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So is there a way to put a foot-like collider so, for example, the tail collides at the ground?

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're going to hate this one. For that you need a dynamic bone collider,

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
which can only be spheres right now, in the ground, which is parented to your avatar,

197
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
which is incredibly big. And then you'll have a floor collider for your dynamic bone.

198
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's how you do it. I'm going to draw a crappy paint image for you right now.

199
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't have any of this running, but I feel like doing it, so I'm going to do it.

200
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's going to be amazing. Oh yeah, they've got a really long body by mistake.

201
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Alright, here you go. Here's how you set it up.

202
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So, you put that giant sphere collider, but parented to you,

203
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and you make it really, really big, and then the tail will be unable to go through the ground.

204
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I hope you enjoyed Prime's artwork.

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah, big huge ball that you carry around with you.

206
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll try not to make many innuendos about the big balls dangling behind you.

207
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There's another question, which says,

208
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
since Neos uses some kind of Unity, is it compiled of IL2CPP?

209
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't know much about the Unity side of things, actually.

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I just don't need to go there a lot, and it's kind of scary to go there,

211
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
because it's a little bit of a mess down there right now.

212
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The Froox Engine side of things is just a compiled DLL.

213
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We do a bunch of post-processing on that DLL to make it even more efficient.

214
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That does work with the IL, so just make it more efficient.

215
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I haven't looked into that as well, because that's kind of scary.

216
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But, once it goes over to Unity, it's a regular Unity project.

217
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
On the very rare occasion where I compile the Unity project,

218
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I get the made-by-Unity splash screen before I get Neo's splash screen,

219
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
because I'm using a version of Unity that doesn't have a pro license or whatever.

220
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So it's just like, made-by-Unity, and then giant Neos logo.

221
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But it's like, OK, cool.

222
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Forgot where I was for a moment.

223
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So we're closing in on half an hour,

224
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
so if you have any additional questions, please go get them typed up,

225
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and I'll get them answered in the order that they appear.

226
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Merogverse has another question,

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
which is it possible to load a C Sharp script

228
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
or some other programming language that is in text form?

229
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
No. Well, sort of.

230
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's a long question, depending on what you want to do, really.

231
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So the ultimate way of doing C Sharp would be to write a plug-in.

232
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That would give you infinite freedom to do whatever you want.

233
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
If you want to hook up Neos with logics to a firework machine,

234
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
you can totally do that.

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Someone will probably enter the world and immediately crash it

236
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and, like, shoot off all your fireworks,

237
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but you could do it if you wanted to.

238
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Below that is then, of course, mods,

239
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
which is where you are modifying the existing game.

240
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That has limitations whereby you'll probably crash the game

241
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
more than you realize if you're writing mods,

242
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
particularly if you're in multiplayer sessions.

243
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And then beneath that is logics,

244
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
which, of course, you know our language,

245
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but that's not text-based.

246
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And then beneath that is there's a couple of worlds

247
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
which have text-based languages that people have created.

248
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Those are usually limited in what they can do

249
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and probably wouldn't be suitable for generic programming.

250
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
They are suitable for sort of playing around and experimenting,

251
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
but they can do things like create cubes, create shapes,

252
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
mathematical shapes or otherwise, et cetera.

253
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
They're really cool.

254
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
In the future, on our roadmap,

255
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
we want to look into taking a look at something called WebAssembly,

256
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
where you can kind of just write any language

257
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and compile it in a way that will work with Neos.

258
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
We don't know what that will look like.

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It is on the roadmap.

260
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Moonbase has a question here.

261
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
They say, how does one do color dialogues?

262
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's say changing material color in your avatar.

263
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What's the best way to do that?

264
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Unfortunately, right now,

265
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
the best way to do color dialogues

266
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
is either to copy the inspector's components.

267
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You can do that.

268
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
All you need is a UIX canvas,

269
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and then you can make a button

270
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
that will trigger a color dialogue and work correctly.

271
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That is a little bit complicated.

272
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So what some people do is they'll parent

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
a invisible color dialogue to their avatar, to their tool,

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and then when it's needed,

275
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
they will summon it to a correct position,

276
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
turn on its active checkbox, and then you can edit it.

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That is okay.

278
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If you do do that, though,

279
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
consider just having one of them

280
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and then redirecting where it's driving its color to,

281
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
rather than having multiple.

282
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
If you have set colors,

283
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
then set colors can also be done without the color dialogue.

284
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I should probably do a tutorial at some point

285
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
on how you can basically inspect an inspector

286
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
to figure out how to make UI in UIX.

287
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's kind of cool.

288
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's like, oh, on my personal customized piece of UIX,

289
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I need a number input box.

290
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
How do I do that?

291
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, if you inspect the inspector,

292
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
you can find out how the inspector

293
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
does a number input box.

294
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Lex asks, are you able to modify

295
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
currently as functionality of plugins

296
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
in case you want to, for example,

297
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
add values to enums or add functionality to a class?

298
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Adding functionality to a class should be easy

299
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
by either using partial classes,

300
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
extending it or something like that should be easy.

301
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That would really be like a C sharp question, though.

302
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
How do you add stuff to an existing class?

303
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Partial class might work.

304
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Extending to a new class might work.

305
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Of course, you have the opportunity

306
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
to overwrite our bootstrapper.

307
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
At that point, you can do whatever the hell you want.

308
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I understand that might be tricky,

309
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
because you might say like,

310
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
hey, no, I want this method to do something different.

311
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You might be able to overwrite it.

312
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's a little bit tricky, isn't it?

313
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Moving forward, Scant says,

314
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
does Neos prefer a large message,

315
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
a few large messages or mesh messages?

316
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Does Neos prefer a few large mesh meshes

317
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
or far more smaller ones?

318
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I noticed that a specific world I was uploading

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
would only save with the former.

320
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Not saving probably has nothing to do

321
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
with the size of your meshes.

322
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I would say smaller ones currently,

323
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
but I don't have any scientific basis

324
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
to back that up currently.

325
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Specs says you can create an application

326
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
running a web server and interact with it

327
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
using WebSockets.

328
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That would keep Neos vanilla.

329
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I believe that's in reference to plugins,

330
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
mods, and stuff like that.

331
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That would work, but please, for the love of God,

332
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
consider the HTTP notes.

333
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So many people just always use WebSockets.

334
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And I'm like, that has additional overhead, you know?

335
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If you're doing request response style data,

336
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
just use HTTP. It's much better.

337
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Everyone's like, but a WebSocket server!

338
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And I'm like, just use HTTP notes.

339
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's how the rest of the world works.

340
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The rest of the world only opens up a WebSocket channel

341
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
when they need bidirectional data flow.

342
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Moving forward to Irigibus has another question.

343
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I saw someone with a UI searching public objects in Neos.

344
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That is RedX.

345
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It could also be GilFX's original one,

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
which you can find in GilFX's public folder.

347
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I use the GilFX's one because I can't find RedX

348
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
either.

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I dislike the situation that we have in Neos for it.

350
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's like, if you don't know where something is,

351
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
you can't find it.

352
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I know that's obvious and follows logically,

353
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but it's annoying.

354
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And the whole, like, ask someone that's already got it,

355
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I also find that annoying.

356
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But in this case, it is correct.

357
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If you don't have RedX, just ask someone for it.

358
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It'll probably be in one of those new user folders

359
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
as well, which should make it a little bit easier to find.

360
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, yeah.

361
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Easton's got a link for you.

362
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, bidirectional repeated data.

363
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And so it's like an event flow, right?

364
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So a good example which might be easy to figure out

365
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
is, let's say you have two applications.

366
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So you have a chat application, which is for chatting,

367
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and then you have an application which is

368
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
to get the weather in my city.

369
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Let's run a test here.

370
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So for the chat application, should we

371
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
use WebSockets or HDP nodes?

372
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll give you guys some time to think and maybe type.

373
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
We're having, like, a live Q&A with chat.

374
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
All right, that's enough time.

375
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So for chat, we should use WebSockets

376
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
because we need bidirectional data flow

377
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and we need surprise data, right?

378
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Someone needs to be able to send a chat message

379
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and the person needs to receive that message.

380
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
To get the weather in my city, though,

381
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
we don't need a bidirectional data flow.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We need a request response data flow.

383
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's known as HDP nodes.

384
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Get me the weather in my city.

385
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Here is the weather in your city.

386
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Done.

387
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Connection closed.

388
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
OK, moving forwards to additional questions.

389
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So we can move on here.

390
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That's done, that's done, that's done.

391
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's done.

392
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Who else?

393
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
How do I buy more storage space?

394
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So you can buy it with Patreon by subscribing to our Patreon.

395
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That will only kick in at the start of the month.

396
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So you've unfortunately just missed the start of November.

397
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So you'll have to wait until December for Patreon storage

398
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
to kick in.

399
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Or you can use NCR to rent more storage using,

400
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
you'll have to use the standalone build to do that.

401
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I believe the price is a little weird right now,

402
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
but it gets you storage automatically.

403
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
There's also a bunch of Neos users who will just give you

404
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
storage space for a while because they have NCR

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and they don't really know what to do with it.

406
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There you go.

407
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Lex says I'm kind of using WebSockets to continuously get

408
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
messages from our YouTube live chat.

409
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yep.

410
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Perfectly fine use for WebSockets.

411
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I love how I'm just going to grab this image of Delta's

412
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Avatar and I'm going to grab my artwork and just put them

413
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
in the same message.

414
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's just beautiful.

415
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You know, it's like that meme where it's like how to draw

416
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
an owl or it's like draw two circles and then draw the

417
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
rest of the owl.

418
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
With that, I believe, though, we're out of questions.

419
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I will give the spec some time to see if they're already

420
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
typing.

421
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
If there ever is, we'll stop questions.

422
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
All right.

423
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
We've got the last question, if that's a question.

424
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
We'll move on with the rest of today.

425
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I hope my dishwasher finishes soon.

426
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I want to cook dinner.

427
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Is it possible to construct meshes dynamically with

428
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Logix?

429
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Last question.

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
No more questions, but yes and no.

431
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Depends what you want.

432
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
There are 3D printers that exist inside of Neos.

433
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
What they do is they use a pen tip and Logix to move a

434
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
pen tip around and just draw the pen.

435
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
They're really quite good, but they act like 3D printers,

436
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
so you get all the internalized geometry.

437
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So if you do a square on the 3D printer, sorry, a cube,

438
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
got to be three dimensional here, then it won't be like

439
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
the cube that you can create from the create menu where

440
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
there's no internals.

441
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It'll be a cube with like goop in the middle coming all

442
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
the way up.

443
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
If you want to do not that, the triangle procedural

444
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
meshes is for you.

445
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Aegis has just posted there in their public folder,

446
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
which I believe is in Neos Essentials somewhere.

447
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
They have a mesh editor that uses the triangle procedural

448
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
mesh, which is really good.

449
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And then beyond that, if you want procedural,

450
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Neos Plus, which Linker has just posted there, has

451
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
dynamic mesh nodes, but it is a plugin.

452
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
However, once you've finished with your dynamic mesh,

453
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
if you bake it, it will turn into a static mesh and then

454
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
you'll be able to take it back to the non-plugin version

455
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
of Neos.

456
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Additionally, there is a world in MMC 2022 where they

457
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
allow you to enter a mathematical equation and then

458
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
it outputs a mesh.

459
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That's really cool.

460
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Lots of sort of shapes that you can see in nature and

461
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
things like that are generated from mathematics,

462
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and so you can do that.

463
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Like if you put in the correct mathematical equation,

464
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
for example, you'll get a snail shell or like a close

465
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
approximation to it.

466
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
With that, I'll go ahead and leave off questions and

467
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
this session, and I will speak to you guys soon.

468
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If you have additional questions, ping me, DM me,

469
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
questions and help, and read the wiki and use web

470
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
sockets for bi-directional communication only.

471
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Goodbye.
