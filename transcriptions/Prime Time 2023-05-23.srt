00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Welcome to Primetime, it's 4pm, we'll get started.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I'm going to read the questions in the order that they appear.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 We currently only have one question, so please keep the questions coming.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 They go in the thread, which is in the Office Hours text chat.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 There's a few channels about the one that you're currently looking at.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Drop your questions in there, I'll get them in the order that they appear.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 So first question that we have today is from Tiki, and Tiki says,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 "What is the best way to get semi-transparent material? Jelly-like.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Side question is there documentation on how to layout tri-planar material textures?"

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 So, semi-transparent materials, always try the nearest central material's glass textures as a base.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 The reason I say that is because getting glass looking correct is very difficult.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And so if you start with those as a base, it will get you to looking like glass.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And then if you want jelly, you might want to just reduce the transparency a little bit,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 and then maybe up the shine a little bit, and probably get rid of the...

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 There's like a normal map or a metallic map on that, that makes the glass look sort of unclean-ish.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 You know, it's got imperfections in it.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 If you're on a public transport bus, that kind of glass, right?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 It's glass, but it's been through the ringer, which is a phrase I don't know if Americans use.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 It means it's been through stuff.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 As for your second question, "Is there documentation on how to layout tri-planar material textures?"

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Tri-planar is a little bit weird because of the way it sort of wraps stuff around.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I always call it the wrapping paper material.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 So if you imagine you're trying to wrap a very awkwardly shaped Christmas present,

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 you hate doing that, but the tri-planar material loves doing it.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And it just sort of vacuum forms your textures over the material.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 That does cause looping, of course, if you imagine taking your single texture and then making it into a roll of wrapping paper,

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 that's what you're going to get.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 It also does that roll of wrapping paper in all directions from the point of that.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 A bit like when you're wrapping a book or something.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 So that's also how you do the textures, right?

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 You just keep that in mind.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 There is no special way to lay them out, but for tri-planar in particular, looking for seamless as possible.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 As an example here, some of the grass textures that are in Neosy Central's materials,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Ground, Dylan, I think it's Dylan, his pack, they're great, but they don't tile that well.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 One tile's better than the other.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But yeah, make sure it tiles well.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 That's basically all there is to it.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Alex asks, "Is the news true?"

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 That depends on the news network that you're following.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I've heard bad things about Fox News, but I don't really know because I don't really watch US TV.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I always use for news.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I use the BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, because I am from the UK, and you're basically brought up trusting the BBC.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 The BBC is also sort of subsidised by the government-ish and subsidised by the public over there, so it's usually OK.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I usually compare and contrast that with Channel 4 news.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Channel 4 is my favourite TV station over there in the UK.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Great places, but I don't consume US news at all.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So yeah, there you go, that's the statement on "Is the news true?"

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Do remember that there is a lot of conspiracy and issues, people saying "fake news" etc.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Also remember that certain news networks are affiliated to certain political parties.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Jekyll left a comment that said that "The youngster found my public folder in the World is Covered in Cheese."

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Excellent. Fantastic.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I'm happy that you are enjoying my public folder.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Tiki asks for the folder again for Blasic. Blasic? Yes, Blasic.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 "Basic glass materials."

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Neosessentials materials glass.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 It might be Neosessentials assets materials glass now, but it's one of those two things.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 "Alexos has seen a few instances where components from the Dash more specifically desktop viewer-related components are appearing in people's world space without the user knowing it happened causing the world to crash. Would you know any reason why this might be happening?"

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 No, although there are some tools starting to spread that do just like progressively hackier things, which might result in some components being attached in world space.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 From the sounds of things though, it sounds like facets and components are being in, you know, dropped into the world space somehow.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 That might be some sort of parenting issue or something.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I'd need to look at a crash log to make sure you open a GitHub issue for that one.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Lakeside Miners says, "A mod I have makes use of some icons. Cheese and a potato. Are the icons built in or part of the mod? If built in, why is the mod, why is there a potato icon in the game?"

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 So this is a difficult question.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 When you're like, a mod I use and you don't provide the source of the mod, it's difficult for me to see if that mod is including those icons itself.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I know it is not because of the two icons that you've listed, but remember that context is the king.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Alex, context is the king for your question as well. Use more words.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 The cheese icon is built in because it is a meme that Freaks put into the game.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 He added desktop mode support and when he did that he added curses and there was some commentary about feedback about the curses.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 He was like, "Maybe we'll do custom curses in the future."

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I said, "Yay, like a cheese cursor!" and then he gave me a cheese cursor. That's why the cheese icon is in there.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 That is a permissively licensed cheese icon so it can be used for basically everything.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 As for the potato, you can give that to yourself as a badge. It is sort of signifying that your computer is bad.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I don't really know why we continue to have that as an icon. It's sort of like an in-joke or a meme.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Moving forwards.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Luzanth says, "Is there any way to have virtual keys read from controller buttons? I'm trying to bodge together a dedicated jump button for one of my avatars."

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Nope. You'll have to use the logic notes for that.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 TK says, "By the way, in New Year's Essentials assets, CG0 materials, are there any empty subfolders?"

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Yes. Aegis and the content team are in the process of migrating assets around into various folders such that they are clearer and better.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 That process sometimes leaves blank folders that don't go away and are quite stubborn.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Sometimes those folders are also automatically generated.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So at one point, the CG0, or usually CC0, not CG0, so I'll just say CC0,

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 the CC0 materials are uploaded by a batch process which Frux runs on his computer, but that might have not been running in a while.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I have the potato badge on my account because despite my ability to run Neos quite well, my computer is just generically jank all the time.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 For example, my graphics card has fans on it, like your graphics card has, hopefully, anyway.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And the fans are wearing out, the bearings are gone.

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I bought a replacement fan set and I've replaced the fans on that card a few times, but I can't remember which ones I have and have not replaced.

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So I'm gonna go ahead and buy another fan set, throw out the ones I've already got,

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 because I've got a box of them but I don't know if the ones in the box are the old or new ones, so I'm just very confused.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 And so I've gotta just buy brand new fans again.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 The moment I get them out of the box, write on them with a Sharpie, like a date, and that way I shouldn't get confused again.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Yeah, it's fun. Eventually I will get a new computer and that may be a problem.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I also refuse to reinstall Windows. I haven't reinstalled Windows in something like 10 years.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I upgrade it when there's security and stuff like that, but I won't reinstall it.

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Everyone's like, "If you reinstall Windows, it will fix that issue."

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, I could just fix it without that."

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 One of the more annoying issues to fix is, you know on your lock screen, you can select a photo to be on the lock screen,

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 or you can enable what's called Windows Spotlight.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Windows Spotlight is a feature on Windows where it will show photography photos from around the world,

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Flickr-style photography photos, and usually a couple of hotspots that you can click that go to news or current events.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 I disabled that because I don't like it, because I don't like random stuff being pushed onto my computer.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 But then I couldn't use the custom photo option, but it was stuck being the last Spotlight photo it had acquired for about two years.

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And I was trying to fix that forever.

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Eventually a friend helped me out and we found exactly in the computer where that image data was, and we deleted it.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And it now vanished, and my lock screen is just blank and blue.

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And I will prefer that over that image, because your lock screen is usually the first thing you see during the day,

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 and it meant that I hated that photo.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It was a very nice photo, but I just hate it.

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Because it was like, you know, waking up, I haven't had my coffee in the morning, and the first thing you see is that goddamn photo.

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Occasionally it reappears, but like a blurred version, so I assume it's still on my hard drive somewhere.

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 It's like a really weird thing to be agitated about, but you know.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It's the equivalent of, I guess, when you try and save your energy when you wake up.

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 You're like, let me have my coffee before I deal with that important email.

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Let me have my coffee before I ring that telephone number I need to ring, etc.

114
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Okay, I see no additional questions in the list, so please keep getting the questions.

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I'll just start commenting on random stuff.

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Hopefully we won't start talking about recycling again.

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Player Cody says, let me have my coffee before going through all the inspectors that are in the world.

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Absolutely. Let me have my coffee before I unpack this huge piece of logic. Absolutely.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Jekyll says they think they already have the answer to this, but Neos will not let you add your custom badge in the same way you can change your name tag.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Yes, that is correct. You need to speak to a team member to get the name badge done.

121
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 All team members can get you that name badge done.

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Shifty is the most efficient at doing it, but it's only a small part of her job.

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 So if there are other team members around that are happy to do it, do let them know.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 She's fantastic at doing it. I just, you know, I want to share her load sometimes so that she can focus on other things in her life and in her role.

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I forgot I did the, like, I forgot I did the, like, I was just scrolling through the Patreon wiki page and I found a graph and I'm like, who made that graph?

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 It's like, oh, it's me. I made that graph. You could find that here.

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 That's a cool graph. It doesn't really matter these days, but I did a cool graph.

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I think it says worried about your reliance on coffee. Everyone has a vice rate. For some, unfortunately, it's alcohol or even more unfortunately, it's, you know, drugs, etc.

129
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 But everyone has a vice rate. So maybe it's TV for you. Maybe it's YouTube shorts or TikTok.

130
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 It's something that they do too much that they shouldn't be. I am happy that mine is coffee and YouTube.

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Anything beyond that, I'm like, OK, we've got to fix that, but I'll take it. I'll take coffee and YouTube. Absolutely fine.

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I love Lakeside Miners comment here. For context for the recording, Lakeside Miners says, I love how you've done it.

133
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 99% of the tutorials for Neos. The rest is just random furries showing you how to use random niche assets within Neos itself and not YouTube.

134
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 It's like, yeah, that's that's pretty much our YouTube space.

135
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 As a reminder, like every single person that is listening to this recording or here live with me make tutorials, even if you copy exactly every single one of my video subjects.

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 So you make a tutorial, my first tutorial subject, your way of explaining it, your way of showing someone might be better than mine.

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It might be more efficient for them. It might be different for how they learn.

138
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I was thinking the other day about sort of tailored learning for younger people, especially neurodivergent people.

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 If they have a special interest, let's say cars, you could structure an educational program for them that focuses mathematical teaching on cars.

140
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 You know, instead of the usual mathematical textbook thing of, you know, Prime has five apples, Play Cody has seven apples.

141
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 How many apples do both of them have? You could do it based on cars like, you know, Cody has five sports cars through Lamborghinis.

142
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 So Cody has five Lamborghinis, Prime has five Ferraris.

143
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 How many cars do they have together? And you're still teaching the younger person basic mathematics, but you're teaching it with the sprinkle of their their hyper fixated special interest.

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And I don't know if that occurs. I'm certain it does. But this is just like shower thoughts at like 3 a.m.

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Right. I'm just like, maybe that would be a better way to teach some people bring what they need to learn into their world.

146
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And, you know, when I talk about cars, there's like, you know, there's so much we can go into, you know, start with cars.

147
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Right. And as they get older, you can like pop the hood of the car and you can do physics based on the car.

148
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 You can learn a lot about the sort of physics of pressure, for example, just by explaining how the brake system works in a car.

149
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Dinosaurs again. Great. You can do height, you can do weight, you can do volume.

150
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 You can even do distance, you know, like a flock of T-Rexes has to journey 40 miles to the east, 40 miles to the south and 40 miles to the north.

151
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Like, where do they end up, you know, to find their food, all sorts of stuff.

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Then you've got a triangle. I think I just described a triangle. Anyway, any more Neos questions?

153
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Anyone Neos questions before I'm like, ah, let's get to my TED talk about better education for neurodivergent people.

154
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Jackal says, do you have a video on using logic scripting to drive bone animations?

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 I do not. Other people might. One of the people I've seen who is like fantastic about it is Gyrbelle.

156
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Gyrbelle's characters and avatars usually have wings and she writes a lot of logics to drive those wings.

157
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I do have some stuff on bone effectors that I wanted to make into a tutorial.

158
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Sometimes we come up to the problem where you've got like a bone chain.

159
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Usually it's a tail or it's an ear. Come on, we know what we're doing here, even ears.

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 But usually the dynamic bone chain will drive that entire bone set and you won't be able to animate it.

161
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 But if you use the effectors feature, you can drive the dynamic bone chain in a very, very easy way.

162
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I will dodge around questions here, but we've got like a rat hole that will end up because someone will ask questions about education and I've got more to say.

163
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Lakesideminers asks, what's the difference between deleting and recycling?

164
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I'm not entirely sure if you're referring to Neos or we're just going to like meme an offshoot over to recycling again, but I'll try and keep it Neos focused and I'll tell you about the difference between the pink and red trashcan.

165
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Okay, the reason they're saying recycling is, yet last week's episode, I guess you could call it, we just talked about recycling for a long time.

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Like IRL recycling is in that recycling bin that's in your cupboard or whatever, but there is a Neos version of it, which is the difference between the pink trashcan and the red trashcan.

167
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So you get a free answer to that that is Neos centered.

168
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So when you, let's say, spawn something from your inventory and then later don't need it and you pick it up with your hand and use the context menu to delete it.

169
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 That delete button is red, but you're technically using the pink trashcan methodology.

170
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And what that does is it will say, okay, you've deleted the object, but is anyone else using any part of the object in the world?

171
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 So let's take, for example, maybe it's an avatar and you're picking up this version of an avatar and you're deleting it, but there's a copy or a duplicate of the avatar to the left of you or to the right of you in the world.

172
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It'll go up while other people are still using this texture, they're still using this material, so I won't delete the material. I'll keep that material involved.

173
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And so that is the pink trashcan. That's what the pink trashcan will do.

174
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 The red trashcan doesn't care about that system and will just blow away stuff.

175
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I have a video on the pink trashcan and the red trashcan, which gives you a visual example of the difference of both.

176
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I just need to find it, which is always fun.

177
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 We do want better icons for both trashcans. Here it is, literally titled pink trashcan versus red trashcan.

178
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 It sounds like a children's nursery rhyme, like, you know, there's a nursery rhyme that comes to mind.

179
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 I just need to check it actually exists unless it was like a fever dream.

180
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 I've not heard this thing. Oh, God, that's Coco Mellen. No, this was like on a cassette tape.

181
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 That's a Smurf version. I don't want the Smurf version. I want the original. I don't remember this either.

182
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I don't remember the lyrics. I can remember like one line. It was something on the lines of like, I'm a pink toothbrush or a blue toothbrush.

183
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Yeah, there's this nursery rhyme somewhere there. I just don't know what it is.

184
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 We do have three trashcans.

185
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Alps Splash asks, will there be tooltips for those pink colors and red?

186
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yes, we want to do tooltips. We also want to update the icons there so that the pink one is a little bit mealy here.

187
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Got recycling themes in it. We're also considering maybe moving away from trashcans.

188
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 It's an interesting thing when you think about icons like the trashcan and also the save icon.

189
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 So there's a meme over on YouTube where you show Gen Z as you show them like a floppy disk, like a physical floppy disk.

190
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And they go, oh, that's really cool. It's like a 3D model of the save icon. And you're like, no, it's an actual floppy disk.

191
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 It saves data. How much data? About a megabyte. And they're like, what?

192
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 OK, I have found the nursery rhyme certainly exists. This is a sounds like an all female casting.

193
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 The sound that I have on a cassette tape that's probably somewhere in my parents basement was definitely an all male cast singing it.

194
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 So like the exact intonation of the lyrics is different, but that is the nursery rhyme that I'm referring to.

195
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 And I'm glad it exists. It was not a fever dream. I will now see if there's any additional questions.

196
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 There are not. So we're still talking about trash cans, toothbrushes and recycling.

197
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 If those were unsure why the floppy disk was called the floppy disk, it's a bit like a cassette tape inside the cassette tape.

198
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Sorry, that's like might also not hit with some people. We used to put films and stuff on metal, magnetic ribbons inside cassette tapes.

199
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And so the same material that you're seeing there coming out of that cassette, that VHS tape was actually also in floppy disks, but as a disk shape.

200
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And so the plastic bit, the bit you see on the outside, just surrounds it and prevents it from being damaged or dust getting in.

201
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 It's strange because, you know, we've advanced electronically a lot, but we still go back to the storage medium of the past.

202
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 So we started with tapes and punch holes. You could make punch holes and then put it through and music would play because it would look at the holes.

203
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 We had punch holes for computers at some point. We could program them, etc.

204
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 But then we went to magnetic tape and then we had vinyl, you know, things like that where we were accrued a crude in it.

205
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 But then we went back to a disk with the floppy disk and then the CD ROM, etc.

206
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 I think we've gone past disks now. Now we're into like silicone and like little little rectangles sorted circuit pods.

207
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I don't know. We'll go back from that. Probably the next one will be some form of like quantum storage. That'll be weird.

208
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Anyone who knows anything about quantum computing, you know, more than me.

209
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I tried to do some quantum computing programming because there's quantum computing programming languages and they're just like, oh, yes, we have this group of qubits.

210
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 We apply the H A B operation to them and now they're all zero. And I'm like, cool.

211
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 I'm going to close this tab now and go think about my life. Oh, just before I get onto this question.

212
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 If you put a jam sandwich or a jelly sandwich, if you're American, into your VHS player as a kid, you're one of the cool people.

213
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Now onto questions. Lexavo says, would you be able to explain why this website is public, but nothing has been said by the nearest team?

214
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 The team has said before they only say stuff when they're ready to announce it. So there's a reason the team isn't ready to talk about this.

215
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Yes. Yeah. That's the reason why that's there. That's a website. You can look at it.

216
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 We don't have anything else to say about it. When we do, we will.

217
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Next, Lou says, is there a way to share a computer window in world space without using streaming sites as a middleman?

218
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 No, not currently. There might be a way if you were to write a plugin, probably not a mod because of the complexity required.

219
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 But if you were to write a plugin, you might be able to do it. For anyone who's like confused about that one.

220
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I want you to remember that all forms of screen sharing or remote access to other people's computers are basically video streaming.

221
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 In some cases, they're not. Things like X.org or whatever the Linux uses that isn't video streaming when you're sharing a session.

222
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But most stuff that you'll see, like if you're on a Zoom call, a Teams call, whatever other meeting provider that you use,

223
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 it's streaming a video to another person. So it's sort of like having a little Twitch stream that's private.

224
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And then we send the mouse cursor data from your mouse through the Internet over to their mouse and then their mouse moves around.

225
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 So that's why it can't be done without video streaming. Moving forwards to app splashes.

226
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Next question. Nice Newgrounds logo, by the way. Will there be theme layouts for your context menu or dashboard so you can have default or changes bleached dashboard?

227
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 You can actually already change some of it. You can't because we haven't upgraded it a lot.

228
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 You can fix up with the home dash screen. You can change that as much as you want.

229
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Like I saw someone the other day who had deleted all the standard dashes facets off of it and the entire like home screen was just a mirror.

230
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 They're like, I don't care about anything else. I just want a mirror on my dash. You can do that if you want.

231
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 You can also change up the world browser and put in different sort of world browser based facets if you want.

232
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I haven't seen anyone do that except for me. I made the washer in facet. But you can do that should you wish to.

233
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 It's cool. The context inventory settings session and file explorer you can't change currently, but eventually you want to be one.

234
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 We we we we we want you to be able to change those as well with the similar facets system.

235
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Like put my whole English back into my mouth. Anyone got like a bottle of English?

236
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I need to like swig from some as for context menu can already customize your context menu.

237
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 When you customize your context menu using the context menu customization, that's a mouthful options that we have.

238
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 It will still look like the context menu that you know and use.

239
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But you can add additional items to it like a sort of pizza. Right.

240
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 You can add another slice to it to do something else.

241
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 You can, of course, make your own custom context menus using any anything you like.

242
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 I have seen custom context menus using the same UI system that the current ones do.

243
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I have seen context menus that use physical based elements.

244
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 I've seen some sort of emulated other video games.

245
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I just completed the other day. I completed the brand new game from Sion.

246
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Sion are an amazing video game company that made favorite game series of all time.

247
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 They just released a new video game where they have a view on context menus, which is actually kind of annoying, but also unique.

248
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 So maybe someone will recreate that at some point. It's really cool.

249
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Up to you. Next question is from Shadow X, who says, could there ever be a component that renders a HTML string as a texture?

250
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Yes, but we'd probably just embed a browser at that point.

251
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 The problem with like HTML rendering is it's one of the most complicated things that you can do.

252
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 You have to remember, like this isn't an indicator of how complicated HTML rendering is.

253
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Microsoft, one of the biggest companies in the world, were like, nah, we're not going to do that anymore.

254
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 We'll just take Chromium, which is the engine behind Chrome, slap our logos on top of it and done.

255
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And that's what a lot of people are doing. So, for example, in Discord right now, you're running Chrome.

256
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I mean, it's not like literally Chrome, but it basically is. And everything you see is sort of a lot of HTML with about triple the amount of JavaScript running on top of it.

257
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And I love and hate it. I hate it because it's very complicated and unwieldy usually, but love it because like, hey, it works, right?

258
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 We're talking to each other. Discord looks good. Of course, there's stuff that they can improve, but most of the stuff they've got correct.

259
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Storm DPD has sent a photo of old English wood conditioner and cleaner.

260
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 I get really annoyed when cleaning products look like beverages and that one has the sort of it looks like beverage.

261
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It looks like beverage. Hi, I look like beverage. Do you? I look like beverage too sometimes.

262
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Definitely doesn't taste like a beverage. Yeah.

263
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 There's a comedy sketch by a comedian called Dave Gorman where he plays a game with his audience on his show about packaging and determining what is inside the package by the picture that's on the packaging.

264
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 It's very sort of it's a very good game.

265
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 For example, if there is a cow on the package, what do you assume is inside it?

266
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 You'd assume beef or milk, but if there's a dog on the package, you don't assume that there's dog milk or dog food, dog meat in there.

267
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 You assume it's dog food. And then it gets really, really, really, really complicated.

268
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 If you think of more examples, it's like what? Fabuloso is a bad offender, as are like dish soaps.

269
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And in some cases, the not the spray cans for fragrance, but the like the ones you put in like an electrical outlet like those always look very tasty.

270
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 The annoying thing as well is, yeah, it's like, do you do you drink this or is this to make your house smell nice?

271
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Also, I can't think of anything worse than having my like house smell like strongly of raspberries.

272
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And then there's this, which looks very similar to the air freshener, but is actually for consumption.

273
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 But isn't for direct consumption. You have to brew it in hot water.

274
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It's a very confusing scenario that you're always in perfect timing in these in these Google search results is this, which is iced tea.

275
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 But it looks very similar to old English wood cleaner in design.

276
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 So it's very confusing. Anyway, are there any additional Nios questions before we start talking about packaging?

277
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I posted a link to the Dave Gorman, the rules of animals on packaging part.

278
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 It is good. That's a question. I'll take it. Last question as well.

279
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 It's thirty four. Actually, those people typing, if you got a question, go for it. Otherwise, yay.

280
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Thumbs up. Lex says, when someone is distinct, why are value streams still synced?

281
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I think it's because they run on different different channels.

282
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 So they all have different priorities and different systems like that.

283
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 So updates to the world model, which is usually what people mean by being distinct to updates to the world model.

284
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 They run on a different channel, a different system of data than the value streams that are coming from someone's avatar or something like that.

285
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 That's why you can often still see someone moving and talking.

286
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 But the object that they're picking up doesn't exist yet because it's separate systems.

287
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Yeah. It's interesting because like sometimes there aren't many news questions, but I've found I've had this commentary towards me.

288
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I'm not being egotistical in saying it. The people are amazed by the things I talk about sometimes.

289
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 So people sometimes come along just for that. I don't know why.

290
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And you remember the game? See, here we go. Anyone remember the game Abe's Odyssey?

291
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Because when I said I don't know, I got reminded of the sound effect of Abe from Abe's Odyssey going like, I don't know.

292
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 They do this like weird shrug. Abe's Odyssey was a good game.

293
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I always remember it being slightly, slightly too difficult for me, though, as a kid.

294
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Maybe I should go back and play it now. I'll probably get frustrated with it.

295
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Sometimes with platformer games such as those, you'd like enter a new area after completing one of the areas and you're like, another area?

296
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Right. Because it's much of the same. I know I had that playing. I think it was like Limbo, the game from many years back.

297
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Hey, Zlinko, I always double check for questions. I always double check for questions.

298
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Sometimes I do get carried away and miss them. It's like, hey, I think all the questions are answered. I don't think we've missed any.

299
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 I am going to go ahead and leave off there. I have a parcel that's arrived and I need to go grab it.

300
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I will speak to you guys later. Please feel free to drop questions in the questions and help channel. Directly DM me or send a pigeon my way.

301
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I will speak to you guys later.

302
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,480
 later.
