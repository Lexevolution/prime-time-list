1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 All right. It is the top of the hour. Let me get this recording started. So welcome

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,900
 to office hours. This is the top of the hour. We can go ahead and get started. I don't see

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,560
 any questions right now. So lovely. That's awesome. Quick notice. I was just looking

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,240
 at the calendar. There will be no office hours on the subsequent two Mondays -- Tuesdays.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,060
 So there will be no office hours on the 20th or the 27th. I'm out of the country again.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,440
 So next office hours will be in 2023 on the 3rd, which is always like the meme people

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,200
 do in December. They're like, see you next year. Finger guns, jazz hands. And it's like,

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,840
 please, like, go home. So, yeah. Everyone has a great holiday period.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,680
 But, yes, I will be in various parts of Europe. I've got a pack and stuff. I hate travel.

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,980
 So we still have no questions. I'm going to go ahead and double check the prequestion

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:04,320
 sheet that Nolan uses. Make sure that's empty. It is. It's empty. It's been empty since August.

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:13,360
 Oh, we have some good questions. Great. Love it. Good questions. So, switch to English,

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,980
 please. SHFR says do you have any plans to do a tutorial on the use of evil joints beyond

14
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:25,500
 the simple door hinges? It would depend what I could do. I might do -- so in my public

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,840
 order somewhere, there's I guess what I would call like a train lever. I don't know if that's

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,460
 the real name for it. Let me just Google that. Yeah. Like this style thing. I've got two

17
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,860
 of them. I've got one that can just free form move. And then I've got one with the sort

18
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,080
 of break handle because I wanted that as well. Because that was cool to set up. Yeah. Like

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,480
 this kind of lever. Of course, a lot smoother and less rusty looking than these pictures.

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:06,040
 But you get what I mean. It's like a big lever. I want to make more like tactile physical

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,220
 like interaction objects for Neos. I think a lot of times we rely on UIX a little too

22
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,740
 much and it's just interesting to see. You know, we've got the Japanese community making

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:22,840
 like full on planes work. It's like cool. It's also recently concluded, now it's December,

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:30,240
 of course, Node-Vember, which is sort of an art thing in November where Glenda artists

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:38,920
 just use nodes to make art. And one of them made a shader graph node thingamabob that

26
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,440
 did again tactile controls. In this case, like a DJ deck. But they all looked beautiful.

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:51,040
 It was like let's get more of these together in Neos. So moving forward to additional questions

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,280
 there. Lex says I see this field in the world list manager for item template. Do you have

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,120
 any idea how to use this? This is the component that displays the UI for the world browser.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,980
 Yes. Go ahead and take a look at how the world's

31
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,800
 run facet works. That actually does overwrite that field. There was a lot of hacky stuff

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:19,080
 I had to do there because Neos people can't summon modals. So that's why the modal in

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:27,280
 the world is so gross and doesn't fit everything. But that does overwrite that. You're able

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,280
 to use the item template to change what the world list manager will use when it generates

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,080
 items. There's also I believe it's called world nexus. That's where I abuse UIX and

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,560
 physical representation of the open sessions in the form of a circle liner with archways

37
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,700
 which are portals which lead to each open session. I thought that was cool. It was sort

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:58,920
 of like an art piece, I guess. I think it's like a grassy knoll floating in the sky and

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,400
 then each archway is an active session. I ran that back when we didn't have that many

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,080
 active sessions. Maybe in the VR chat boom that would have been crazy nonsense. But right

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,600
 now it should be quite easy to look at. Moving forward to Zari's question. With you

42
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,220
 having recently held a presentation for the Science Edu, I was wondering if there's been

43
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,840
 jump offs for projects in the site due to the situation. I know things are usually quite

44
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:35,880
 locked in. One wonders given the bad publicity by such a -- always. Like literally always.

45
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,480
 Stuff is always happening in the science realm. Amos is the main science dude that I work

46
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:51,280
 with. There is always stuff going on. So just yesterday we were doing some eye testing stuff.

47
00:04:51,280 --> 00:05:00,440
 And today we just booked a surgeon who is coming into today to recreate a surgical case

48
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 on actual patient scans. We're comparing it to the output from the non VR, non-Nerus process.

49
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,720
 It's just always happening. Sometimes it's not applicable to be shared.

50
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,840
 In this case it's real patient data. It's someone's actual face. I can't share screenshots.

51
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,600
 But otherwise it's kind of open. Just looking through pictures. Yeah, that's nothing there.

52
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,800
 Of course there's also an exposure therapy thingy that we did. I was going to make a

53
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,300
 video on that. But then I can totally do that. But yeah, it's always happening. I'd love

54
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,980
 to see more of it happen. In some aspects it's a little bit harder to make noise about

55
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:54,420
 Neers due to the current kerfuffle. But in some aspects it's okay. I'd like to be louder

56
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:03,600
 with what Neers can do and louder with what and how Neers can help the area. So I should

57
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,480
 do that. But in some cases I'd like the kerfuffle to die down. I'll double check for additional

58
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:19,300
 questions. Another question here from Easton. Hi, Easton. Is it recommended to use a transparent

59
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,300
 mirror on the floor to give a nice reflection effect? In my use case the mirror is only

60
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:31,540
 512 by 512 and it looks really nice. If you want to do reflections on floor, a realtime

61
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:41,560
 reflection probe might be better. I'm not entirely sure which would be more heavy. I

62
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,300
 guess it would depend if probes render in stereo. Mirrors do. I know you'd have to look.

63
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,140
 It would be fine. Some places do that process to get reflections on the floor. They usually

64
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:02,220
 have it on a toggle switch for graphical settings. So make sure that's in place. And just go

65
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,260
 for it. There are much better ways to do it. But hey, just go for it. Zach says can I get

66
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,460
 a clip of you saying something about cheese? You can indeed. Go to my public folder. Go

67
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,340
 to art. Go to cheese. There's a bunch of creations in there where I say stuff about cheese. There's

68
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:25,460
 even a folder where I misspelt cheese. It says he's. There's no C on the front of the

69
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:37,820
 word cheese. He's wisdom. Where I talk about various cursed things about cheese. Oh, hey,

70
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,420
 mirrors work better than reflection probes. Go for it. There's really no other way to

71
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,060
 do it. If you've done reflection probes and they've formed worse than mirrors, then your

72
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,300
 only option is mirror. Make sure it's turn off. You also figure out when you can turn

73
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,740
 it off. Do cull that effect. If they're not in the room, maybe the room's still loaded

74
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,320
 because you haven't done culling. Turn off the mirror. In a very old map by me called

75
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,980
 tea garden, there is actually a slightly opacity, slightly transparent, I guess would be a better

76
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,340
 non silly way of saying that, mirror inside the fountain. And that only turns on when

77
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,060
 you're really, really close. And it's sort of been tailored there. Lots of people use

78
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:26,220
 the fountain and tea garden as a bath. It's just like it's not what it's meant for. It's

79
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:33,420
 not what it's meant for. Whatever. No one goes there these days. So it's fine. Cool.

80
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:39,980
 That's all the questions we have. So I'm going to sit here and think about cheese. And I'm

81
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:45,940
 going to sit here and sip this tea on mute, of course. Any streams or such planned for

82
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,700
 the holidays on news? I'm sure Nexlin will get some stuff sorted. I don't know what their

83
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,740
 plans are. I do know this week's stream will focus on creator geometry. So look out for

84
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,180
 this month's or last month's creator jam content. Accidentally open linked is completely aside.

85
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,940
 Keep typing questions, please. I'm going to ramble. I open linked in. And I'm going to

86
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,900
 say there's a bunch of posts there being pushed to me through sort of like recommendations

87
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:24,220
 rather than me following them. And some of them just make me feel ill. I think they're

88
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:31,820
 making a joke here. But there's like a post from someone saying that they cooked dinner

89
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:38,160
 in their hotel room using a kettle rather than charge the company for their dinner.

90
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,700
 Even though they could totally charge their company for their dinner because they're away

91
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,220
 on a business trip for that company. So charging dinner to that company is the right thing

92
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,040
 to do. And they're like, it's the little things that get you promoted. Like, okay, cooking

93
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:02,420
 chicken in a kettle in your hotel room is what gets you promoted? I'm no. Another thing

94
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:11,440
 that really bothers me as well is like everyone saying, yo, I wake up at 4am and like, I don't

95
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,620
 know, like, run a mile climb a mountain and do half my work before 9am. This is what you

96
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,200
 should do to what they actually mean when they say that is find time in your day where

97
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,540
 you don't have distractions. That's all it means. So the reason why they get up at 5am

98
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,840
 is because their day is so distractible when other people are awake, so that the health

99
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,240
 advice there shouldn't be wake up at the crack of dawn because that's not suitable for everyone.

100
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,100
 Some people need more sleep. Some people don't like mornings like I don't. So it should say

101
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:46,240
 schedule time in your day where you have time to focus. That's all it needs to say. It doesn't

102
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,080
 need to say I wake up at 4am. I wake up at 3am says the next person who's got like, you

103
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,300
 know, a line of supplements they want you to buy. It's just wake up with enough time

104
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,300
 for you to do the crap that you need to do during the day. If that's 4pm, Alex, fantastic.

105
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,660
 If that's 3am, fantastic. But most of these self help people are like, it's got to be

106
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,600
 3am because that's a magic number and let's snort my brain supplements that you can buy

107
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,080
 on my blog. It's like, okay, dude, chill. Zari has a filler question, which is absolutely

108
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,980
 fine. We don't have any nearest questions. It's just me being angry at LinkedIn. So a

109
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,280
 filler question gets me off the LinkedIn approach. So Zari says any thoughts about the U.S. announcing

110
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,720
 today that they reached fusion ignition? Getting more energy out of an experiment than they

111
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,520
 put in? I'm more excited about that after watching one video on YouTube, which really

112
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,840
 isn't that long. And I'm amazed because like it's a really, really good video. It's not

113
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:53,180
 that long. And they literally make fusion happen. So here you go. This is by a channel

114
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,240
 called, it is her name, so Cleo Abram, but the series that she's running on there is

115
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:12,300
 a huge if true. And they build a small fuser in Simone's garage. It's not a free energy.

116
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,280
 Because it's a small one, it's actually expensive to run. It's like running like a vacuum cleaner

117
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,500
 or a hair dryer on full. It takes a lot of energy. It's sucking all the energy out the

118
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,580
 wall. But it is doing fusion. And so then the only thing, and I say the only thing,

119
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:36,040
 like it's simple, is for them to do exactly what they do in that video, but get more energy

120
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,300
 out than they put in at home. And then like energy is solved. Of course, that's very difficult

121
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,900
 to do. And that's why only sort of institutions and governments are doing it. And if you look

122
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,680
 at the fusion chambers that they're using, they're like huge and very confusing. But

123
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,560
 I learned more about fusion in that 30 minute video than I've done in the past many years,

124
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,900
 including education. It's also incredibly pretty. It's just naturally pretty, which

125
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:08,320
 is interesting. Like new power source, naturally pretty. Let's scroll down and look at questions

126
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,160
 now. So linker says do you offer CV or resume proofreading for technical Neos users?

127
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,300
 That is a skill that I do have and can do. Depending on how many, I would have to actually

128
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,820
 charge for that, though. So maybe just for Zlinker, I don't know. But if it's like 200

129
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,500
 of you, then it's going to charge some money. I've got to make up my cheese time. Let's

130
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,200
 move down and see if we've got any actual Neos questions. We have two Neos

131
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:43,600
 questions. I am awesomely happy that we have two of those. So I've got a question how flexible

132
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,780
 is Neos? I think you mean in terms of development, I'm not sure. I'll answer in

133
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,180
 terms of development. But please do take the opportunity to clarify that if you would like

134
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,860
 to. They're saying let's say you need to modify and think how easy is that to do. That hugely

135
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,660
 depends on like what angle it is and how coupled those things are together. When I talk about

136
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:11,320
 coupling, I want you to imagine, you know, those big sort of things that couple electrical

137
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:18,320
 systems together or railway cars together or, you know, chains together. How coupled

138
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,380
 things are together is how long it takes to edit. So as an example here, in isolation,

139
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,020
 logic nodes are easy. Particularly logic nodes that just do mathematics or operations. So

140
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,980
 the plus node, very simple. The minus node, again, the same one minor code. Any of the

141
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,700
 sort of avatar related nodes, they start getting complicated because they're coupled to the

142
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,100
 avatar system. So then they start getting more and more difficult. There are significant

143
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:50,300
 areas that are very difficult to do. Those ones for me are ones where I have no idea

144
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,300
 what's going on because they've got some fruit's magic going in them. Ones that are coupled

145
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:01,380
 very tightly to other systems. For example, there being Twitch. We are aware that the

146
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,300
 Twitch integration that Neos has is fragmenting because it's old and it's breaking. Updating

147
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,980
 that is the equivalent of basically just rewriting it because we need to move to a new version

148
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,420
 of their library. It's a new version of their API and it's just going to be a mess. That

149
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,820
 is on my plate to do. That takes a while. But just a logic node, easy. Let's take a

150
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:29,300
 look at the next question. Is there a way for a tool tip to access the label of the

151
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:36,900
 UI element the user clicks on? Find out what text the user clicked on the specter. It depends.

152
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:46,180
 I love that. It does actually depend on what type of text label you mean. There are some

153
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,060
 that would allow you to do that. But most wouldn't. What you need there is effectively

154
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:57,660
 component access. In most cases, tool tips, I say in most cases, tool tips can only really

155
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:05,660
 see the slot or the collider that a tool tip is aimed at or clicked on. From that, you

156
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,540
 can't get a reference to the label component on that. Be it a text renderer, a piece of

157
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,700
 text in terms of UIX or any other variant of how we render text. There's about ten different

158
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,180
 ways. You can't get a reference to that. What you need is dynamic component access, whatever

159
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,740
 you want to call it. Where you can take a slot and say give me the components on that

160
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,660
 slot and I want the first one that looks like text and from that component, I want the text

161
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,460
 field. That's a feature we don't have. Hamish has linked a video on how close nuclear

162
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:44,740
 fusion is. I presume Hamish knows more than I do. All I know is those two did it in their

163
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:53,180
 garage and they did explain, hey, this is using more power than it's generating. Alex

164
00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:03,740
 says do anyone have an optimized Neos APK build? Ask Xlinka. That's another example of coupling. It's basically

165
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,580
 just sort of like how safe is this change? Logics knows usually okay. Logics knows it

166
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,940
 should touch other stuff. If a logic node has an impulse going into it, one of those

167
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,980
 white ribbons. It's vastly more complicated than the ones that don't. Alex says will the

168
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,300
 new YouTube DL be included in the new version of Neos? When we resume updates, lots of things

169
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,580
 will happen. Probably that included. I think it says how in trouble if I just dump the

170
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,900
 Google drive link here. Probably not. I mean, like, you shouldn't be doing it, but, like,

171
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,020
 whatever. Well, I guess the PR friendly version of that would be I don't personally mind.

172
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:48,540
 Other people might mind. So your mileage may vary. With that, I don't believe we've got

173
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,580
 any additional questions. I'm just scrolling around, making sure I missed any. By the looks,

174
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,180
 things were good. And then that's a third party link. So, hey, it could give you a virus.

175
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,220
 It could not give you a virus. I don't know. I'm not validating or anything. Sorry. I had

176
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,300
 to answer the door so I will catch up with questions now. It was one of those things

177
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:15,340
 where it's like oh, God, drop the headphones and run. I will take a look at what we've

178
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,260
 missed. Another fellow from Zari who says I guess any project you've seen recently that

179
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,220
 you're excited about in addition to the aforementioned Japanese community which continues to be scary

180
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,340
 creative. Not that I can think of on Neos. I haven't really been on Neos, like, socially

181
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,700
 in a while. I've been kind of busy with other things, sorting other things out. I'm always

182
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,860
 interested to see what people see and do and make. I'm really interested if it's not a

183
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:48,260
 multi-tool or an avatar or like an inspector or anything like that. So make more games,

184
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:54,860
 make more art, make more, like, experiences and I'll be happy to check them out. I am

185
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,780
 starting to think about and get excited by MMC which is coming up in February which isn't

186
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,740
 actually that far away. I know it sounds ridiculous that February isn't that far away but it is

187
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:15,980
 not far away. And then we have a question here from Easton who says are there any plans

188
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:25,460
 to improve the storage facet to act more like the cloud storage indicator? You'll have to

189
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:32,780
 explain what the complication there is. They sent a photo and I'm looking at it. Yeah,

190
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,940
 so the storage usage status one is probably just like the logged in user whereas cloud

191
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:45,620
 storage space indicator is, you know, for the whatever you want to look up. Make a issue

192
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,060
 if you'd like to see advancements in that. Yep, you'll have to make a issue to request

193
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:56,220
 that. We will talk about it. And with that, I don't see any further questions and we are

194
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,020
 at the half hour mark. So I'm going to go ahead and end things off here and I will speak

195
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,420
 to you guys at the next office hours in the new year. Do feel free to ping me wherever

196
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,300
 you'd like, ask questions and I'll get to you as soon as I can anywhere else. It's just

197
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:17,340
 office hours that is stopping until third. Yes, the third. I thought it was the second

198
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,540
 for a moment. You know how half the calendars that you have start the week on Sunday and

199
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,440
 half of them started on Monday and sometimes you can set that with a setting for other

200
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,460
 times you can't and it's really annoying. Yeah, that anyway, I will see you guys again

201
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,620
 sometime soon. Stay safe out there. Remember, cheese is good and I'll speak to you later.
