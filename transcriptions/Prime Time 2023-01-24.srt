1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Welcome to Office Hours, it is now 4pm, so we're going to go ahead and get started with Office Hours.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 So, if you have any questions, please ask them in the Office Hours text chat,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 there's a couple of channels above the community meeting stage.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I'm just going to @tag Office Hours again, just to make sure that everyone knows that we're starting,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 and then we'll go ahead and get started on those questions.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Actually, before questions, a little bit from me on some random items that I have randomly decided to talk about

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 just this second and are completely unplanned.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Number one, if there is a moderation issue, do not DM me, do not come up to me and drop a whisper bubble on me,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 do not direct message me on any form of platform whatsoever, just go make a ticket.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Always make a ticket. If you make a ticket, it will be handled appropriately.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 If you DM me, I'm going to forget about it, because all I'm going to hear in my head is

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 "la la la la la la" and bitches of cheese.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 So, like, make a ticket. Don't be scared of making a ticket, go make a ticket.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 There is no excuse not to make a ticket.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Additionally to that, something else I wanted to say but I've just forgotten it, something about tickets, make tickets.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Oh, that was it. If you make an anonymous ticket, we can't respond to it.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 We've got an increasing amount of anonymous tickets.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I can't give you details about the tickets, but I can say that they are anonymous.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 We cannot respond to anonymous tickets.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So, as an example here, which is not a real ticket, we had one that was like, as an example,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 "Hi, my name's Bob and I have this very important thing to talk to you guys about!" as an anonymous ticket.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Great, Bob, we literally cannot respond to you. It's impossible.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Anyway, let's move on to questions after that.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Moving on to questions, we have one from Alex from Alaska who says, "Build anything interesting in the past month?"

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And I'm like, yeah, I have built something interesting.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 So, on and off, we've been working on a project, sciency project again, to basically simulate various movement impairments.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 So we're talking about things like tremors, a loss of reach or range of motion, and things like that.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And the old system was really bad, so I made a new system, and in that new system I actually used a component I haven't used before, which is the Avatar Pose installer.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And Avatar Pose installer will install pose filters when you equip an avatar.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 The Pose installer component needs to be on a slot within the proxy that you want to install it on, which is a little bit of a weird one, because it's difficult to find those slots sometimes.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 But I made a tool that'll do it. It won't work if you, like me, have renamed your proxies, moved them or anything like that, but it will work on a default avatar.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 It installs a wiggler and a wobbler. Those use the avatar pose offset pose filter, a sort of delayed or hard to move hand, which is the pose smooth lerp.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 There's an item in Gearbell's public folder, it's like a dumbbell that's difficult to lift, that uses that as well.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And all of those together lead to a big control panel that you can then use to simulate various movement impairments, and we're using it for various tests and experiments. That's quite cool.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 The idea is to basically make a VR... This is a cursed image search, what the hell?

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Is to basically make a VR version of this. I just posted it in the chat. These are what are called patient empathy suits. That's at least what I searched for.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 But the pictures are kind of cursed. You can see that they're wearing goggles and that the goggles are designed to... What's going on here?

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 The idea is to restrict motion or restrict vision or restrict anything else to make them sort of understand how someone with an impairment like that might move around a room or a particular scenario, etc.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 There's a lot here. This is a good Google search.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I know that there are... One that you might have heard of before that might be a little bit easier to relate to is any of those videos you saw on YouTube where men have electrodes strapped to their waist, etc. to simulate labour pain.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Or like a fat suit, stuff like that. There's also a lot of YouTubers that do that.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Yeah, there's a bariatric training suit. I don't know that this was a thing. I'm kind of disturbed that this is a thing, but I guess it's relevant. I'm going to stop posting cursed images.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 If you just search for patient empathy suits, you'll get a collection of really, really strange goings on. But they are for good research. I don't know, I'm just a little alienated by them.

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 For some reason. Anyway, let's see if we've got any other questions. We don't currently have any other questions, so I'm just going to stroll through this alienating Google image search and giggle whilst I'm waiting for additional questions.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Look, this is me five minutes after waking up. I'm already tired.

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Oh, Discord determined that image to be obscene. It is not. It is a flesh-coloured dummy lying on a bed. We'll try a different one.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 This one's wearing pants, so that might work. Yeah, that one worked.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Although they do get quite meme-y. If there's no questions, I just sort of get giggly and then I find random stuff and we start looking at them.

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 There are no additional questions, though, so if you have any additional questions, please do let people let me know by posting it into the Office Hours text chat.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Tell your family, tell your kids, ask New Year's questions. It's the Office Hours time.

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Here's an example of a scenario where it might, you know, I need to bend over to reach into that cupboard and my range of motion is restricted, so that's difficult.

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 That's like the actual research. Seeing them in isolation is very alienating, but seeing them in context makes perfect sense. That makes perfect sense there.

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I haven't seen any papers or anything like that, but I guess the idea is to increase empathy so that they can better serve those people by understanding the struggles that they face.

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Alright, we have a question. Fantastic, we can stop talking about weird suits.

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Are PRs2, the Neos locale, still being merged in the modern areas that unhold? I've been trying to deal with that, but they've been mounting up and they get kind of problematic because I'm not able to push the - once they've merged with them, I'm not able to push them to any update, of course, because we're not updating.

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 But we also have the sort of weird state where two separate people did a full translation for Chinese, and so I don't really know what to do about that one.

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 There is one I can probably close, which is someone who, Toxic Cookie here, made an UU version of the entire thing. You probably wouldn't be accepting that.

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 You're free to, by the way, download any of those locale files if you want to use them. You can drop them into the locale folder of the Neos installation, and they will work. You'll be able to find them inside the locale switcher.

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Yeah, I can go through - I can add an item to my list to go through them and get them merged.

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 They should be there, because when we do eventually update, we'll be absolutely fine.

61
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I'm just looking at my Neos to-do list and there's an item that just says "Peter Robinson". I have no idea why.

62
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Anyone knows what Peter Robinson means, go for it.

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Most of my notes on my personal Neos to-do list make sense, but that one doesn't.

64
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It just says Peter Robinson. Who's Peter Robinson?

65
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Anyway, I'll move on to a natural question. I'm quite giggly today, it might be the coffee. Anyway.

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I'll see about getting those locale files updated, and then if there's a mod to pull them down, that'll be fantastic.

67
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So, Specs has a question here which says "When trying to set up various components that require a reference type to be defined,

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 it can be very difficult to figure out what types work. There's usually no common types defined,

69
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 and manually editing them can be very obscure in trial and error based. Do you have any advice or tools that can use this process?"

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 There is the one thing that can use the process - one thing being familiarity with that,

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 but then do remember there is the complexed types in components wiki page.

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Additionally, in my public folder there's just a random collection of strings that I spawn in and drag the ones out that I need.

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 We'll hope to improve that in the future, but I understand that's difficult.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I can tag various components with common types. That's done in cases such as the asset multiplexer.

75
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 That's really good in the way that it does there. It's like "Hey, do you want this, do you want that?"

76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And we can totally do that with other components, we just haven't done that.

77
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I think that's it for that question. Do take a look at that one, and do take a look at my public folder.

78
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Rampr talks about Git interface libraries for C#. You do know that Git, if you have the raw file,

79
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 you can just download that as a file, you won't need Git.

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So, I guess enumerating the files you might need in an API.

81
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 All you basically need to do is enumerate the locale files on the master branch, and then gain access to their raw list.

82
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 So let's move down to the next question, and try not to giggle so much.

83
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Ankupilot says "Why connecting with the OpenWorld Logix node via Neocession link does work,

84
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 and connecting with LNL, NAT LNL, and with IP port directly does not?

85
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Suppose we have two users in virtual LAN via ZeroTier, for example, users trying to connect

86
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 node's IP address and port of the session, while join command in launch options connects via IP port, no reason."

87
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Let's figure out what's going on there, because I've also had trouble with the OpenWorld node,

88
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 it's meant to take a lot of ones.

89
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And then there's of course the, if you go to the Logix node browser and you go inside the world folder,

90
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 there's like a bunch of things there, but none of those seem to work with the OpenWorld Logix node either.

91
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 So I get very confused. Let's try and work what those are.

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I've added a note to follow that up as well.

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 So we've got locale here, and then we've got the OpenWorld Logix node.

94
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 So I'll have to take a look at that one. There's probably a way to do it, it's just that OpenWorld node is confusing to me.

95
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 There's some areas where I'm just like, I don't understand what's going on here, it's so difficult to use for some reason.

96
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And then Linker says that Peter Robinson is a crime writer, so I'm going to go ahead and just search Peter Robert.

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 "Peter Robinson was a British-born Canadian crime writer, made the Inspector Banks novels."

98
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I'm just going to go ahead and remove that from my to-do list, like maybe in like three years time,

99
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Neos will just self-destruct because they haven't done whatever the Peter Robinson item is.

100
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 There we go. For reference, my personal notes on Neos are, I can't get you like a page length because it's in markdown format, but 2,110 words long.

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And they are complete, they used to be organized, but they're completely unorganized.

102
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 In fact, at the top of the to-do list, under a section called "Priority", is "Reorganize this list".

103
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Then Zlinker found a paper titled "Supporting the designers to build empathy with people with Parkinson's disease, the role of a hand-trimmism simulating device, and of user research with end users".

104
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 That is totally a sort of paper in that area, so that's cool.

105
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Speaking of papers, by the way, a paper detailing the work that we did for the virtual surgical planning stuff that's on my channel just got accepted for publication.

106
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Once it's published, I'll get you a link to that, but that means that Neos is confirmed to be in a scientific paper coming up soon.

107
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 It's cool, it's great. My name is on the credits there as well, I made sure that happened.

108
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I think there was a paper historically where my name didn't end up on the credits, which is strange.

109
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Sometimes it's difficult because scientific papers usually need people that have scientific qualifications on them, etc.

110
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And while I do have a university qualification, I have no affiliation with any sort of scientific body.

111
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So it's usually like, "Head of surgery at big hospital is on this paper!"

112
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And I'm like, prime with nothing. Hello, I'm a person. I do science too.

113
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 So it's kind of interesting in that regard.

114
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 The democratisation of scientific papers is something I'm very interested in, and could talk at length about, but not here.

115
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 This is the Neos office hours.

116
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Angry Pilot has followed up with a question that says, "Also, how Neocession link is transformed to anything useful when connecting via LAN?"

117
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I just need to look into how that whole system works.

118
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 I know how, for example, NeosDB and NeosRec work, because someone previously asked about those.

119
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I don't know if Neocession. There's got to be some sort of translation mechanism.

120
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 For the past, I don't know, three hours, I've been trying to add my Google Calendar to the Calendar app on Windows,

121
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 such that my Google Calendar alerts will pop out as Windows notifications,

122
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 but it's just stuck on creating accounts. That's very annoying.

123
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I tapped back to it accidentally, and I thought I'd mention it.

124
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Alex says, "Adding the Gmail to the Mail app makes that work." Okay, I'll try adding that.

125
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I've been racking my brain for weeks now about why Peter Robinson was on my Neos to-do list.

126
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Most of the time, when I add stuff to that to-do list, I'm in VR, and so the message isn't that verbose anyway.

127
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But just a name? That doesn't make sense.

128
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 For example, one of the items I have here says "GlyphEMSize64", and I know what that means.

129
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 That's like, why don't we update the default GlyphEMSize to 64 on our Decode font?

130
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 I need to look into that and figure out why we don't, because there's a reason why we don't, I just don't know what it is.

131
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I don't see any additional questions, there is additional conversation about the Neosession stuff,

132
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I don't know how it works, so I'm going to go ahead and look at that more.

133
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Ping me later if I forget.

134
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Ozzy says, "Have you looked into self-driving variables, self-value-hopping at all code-wise?"

135
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I'm honestly really curious about them myself, though given the different systems at play, I understand why I haven't.

136
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Yeah, it's so in the data model that it's really difficult to look at. That's why I say don't do it.

137
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 I really don't recommend doing it. If you need a local value, use Values Override.

138
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 If you're worried about network traffic on a single float, then you need to change your performance-related targets,

139
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 because a single value being transmitted when it changes is no big deal.

140
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I get across this loss and some people get offended by it, but I do find that people spend too much time optimizing stuff that I believe does not matter.

141
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 If you can prove to me that it matters, like, concretely, then fantastic, I'll look into it.

142
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 A question here from SnowyTheDragon says, "Has anyone made Tetris in Neos?"

143
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Yes, there are several variants of Tetris. There is one in the world browser which is probably the most flashy and cool, so try that one out.

144
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 A question from AppenKlit, who says, "Is it possible to check the quality resolution of a YouTube stream?

145
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Can you force the highest resolution?"

146
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I'm not sure if you can. Give me one second to go have a look at the video texture provider.

147
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Again, video texture provider.

148
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 I'm not sure what happens.

149
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 You're right, there's different qualities available a lot of the time, but I don't know how we pick which quality to do.

150
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Because we use YouTube DLP to do that, if it's like a YouTube stream.

151
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I don't know how we pick "get best format".

152
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Looks like we get the best resolution.

153
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 So we get all the info from YouTube, and then we sort the formats that come back from that by the width of the video.

154
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 You can probably change the resolution that you'd like by updating the max width and max height property on the video texture provider.

155
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 To be the maximum resolution that you would like.

156
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 I don't know what those default to, because I can't see a default here in the code, and I don't have Neos open currently.

157
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 But do take a look at that max width property.

158
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I think that's it for that.

159
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Snowy asks, "Can you make a game leader board in Neos?"

160
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Absolutely, there's various ways to do it.

161
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I've seen people do it using a web service, where it just returns a piece of text,

162
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 and then they just throw that piece of text into a text renderer,

163
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 and that way they don't have to deal with any sort of sorting or management in that way.

164
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I've seen people do it with cloud variables, I don't particularly know how they're doing it with cloud variables,

165
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 but I've seen people do it.

166
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Just yesterday actually I was looking at Svekin's boop leader board,

167
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 which is how many times various people have booped him, I have no idea how that works,

168
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 but it was a very long list.

169
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I've also seen game specific ones that don't talk to an external web service,

170
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 so they don't use web servers or cloud variables, they're just for a local game,

171
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 for example a round of a sort of PVP first person shooter.

172
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 A good one that has a lot of theming, I've seen a lot of leader boards,

173
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 but one that has a good theming and design is the Murder X game.

174
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 That one has a leader board where there's custom icons, a custom font, a custom background for the leader board,

175
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 so it looks really, really, really good.

176
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And so I like that one.

177
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 But yes, you can. If you have any questions about how to do that, do let us know,

178
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 and I'll be able to help you out.

179
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Appin follows up with a use case where they're blowing up a video and increasing its size,

180
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 and it doesn't look good right now.

181
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yeah, check that max width, max height, I can't see a default right now,

182
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 there may be a default, I just can't see it currently.

183
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Ah, it looks like the default max width is 1920 by 1080p,

184
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 so if you want to change that, then make it larger than that,

185
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 you might be able to get up to 4K, etc.

186
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Do keep in mind that does sort of...

187
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 I don't think it's double, isn't it like quadruple?

188
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Or it might be less than double.

189
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 It's either less than double or more than double, it's not double as far as I remember,

190
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 depends on the encoder as well. I can never remember which.

191
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It's one of those things where I just can't remember it.

192
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 There's a reason why I didn't work on video when I worked on Mixer, even though they asked me to.

193
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 That's a story for another day though.

194
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Yeah, spec says quadruple the pixels, but yes, it is quadruple the pixels,

195
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 but sometimes the encoder means that while it's quadruple the pixels,

196
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 it's not quadruple the bandwidth.

197
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 You can of course try and squeeze larger resolutions into the same bandwidth,

198
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 but then you get sort of codec issues. I don't really understand.

199
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 By my understanding, Alpin, yes, driving the max width and max height

200
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 should enable you to access higher quality streams,

201
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 although I don't know and cannot confirm about a deeper look into the code that exists.

202
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 So give it a go, if you have any problems do let me know,

203
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 and if it works, share that knowledge.

204
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Tell three other people that you managed to get a 4K stream into Neos,

205
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 and I'm sure that knowledge will spread around like wildfire.

206
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Taking a look down, there's still some conversation going about the session URLs.

207
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Do keep in mind that there is a page written, I must say,

208
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 by one of the participating people of this conversation,

209
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 about the networking information, how networking works inside of Neos,

210
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 which is really handy, so if you want more information about that,

211
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 feel free to of course keep the conversation going,

212
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 but there is the Network Information page, which I said is,

213
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 lots of it were written by Ruscio as well.

214
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Taking a look down at questions, we have TFG Haida says,

215
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 "Does any public health documentation exist for MeshX?"

216
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 No. It does not.

217
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And the second question, which is,

218
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 "When will Neos create doubles on a newly imported mesh?"

219
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Are you asking for it to, or when it does?

220
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Like, you could read that as,

221
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 "Under which circumstances will it create doubles?"

222
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Or, "Can it create doubles? Can we make it create doubles?

223
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Can we have an option to make it create doubles?"

224
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I think there's an option on the mesh importer,

225
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 if you go to the advanced settings,

226
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 you can check "make double-sided" and it will make it double-sided.

227
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I don't know off the top of my head.

228
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 The import routine for models and meshes is largely driven by ass imp,

229
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 and sometimes I will go on like a three-hour spelunk into the code base

230
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 to find out it's actually an ass imp problem.

231
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 For example, all models are somehow rotated by 180 degrees,

232
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 and so when they're imported,

233
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Fruix Engine will then counter-rotate them by 180 degrees,

234
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 and I literally do not know why.

235
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 There is an operation as part of the ass imp routine,

236
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 which instructs ass imp to...

237
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Ass imp? Ass imp?

238
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I really don't know how to pronounce it without talking about butts,

239
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 but anyway, to make it left-handed,

240
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 and sometimes I know that that's not needed

241
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 because the model is already left-handed,

242
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 so I was thinking, and it's on my giant to-do list,

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 to look at the importer to try and detect if the model is already,

244
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 or is not, or is left-handed,

245
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 to not do the left-handed operation again,

246
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 because that... It's causing problems for me.

247
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 What I want for a particular science-based project

248
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 is that if I export a model and then immediately import it,

249
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 I want the same result in Neos,

250
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 but what I get is instead the object slowly rotates by 180 degrees each time.

251
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So if I want it to be back to the original,

252
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 I would have to export it and import it twice

253
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 just to get it to rotate back to the original thing.

254
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 I think that's the left-handedness.

255
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 I don't know. I haven't been able to check that much.

256
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I do have a branch somewhere of Neos

257
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 where I disabled the left-handedness,

258
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 and in some cases that meant that the normals were screwed up,

259
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 and in some cases it didn't,

260
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 because, you know, ugh, split-loose geometry.

261
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 There might be... Don't we already have split submeshes?

262
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I can never remember why a submesh occurs

263
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 compared to just loose geometry.

264
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Oh, not submeshes in this case. Yeah, I understand.

265
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Neos might not have a built-in operation, but Asimp might.

266
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So I double-check if Asimp has it.

267
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 With that, we are at 31 past,

268
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 so I will be cap enough questions here,

269
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 and we'll go ahead and stop Office Hours for today.

270
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 If you have any additional questions, please feel free to direct message me.

271
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Message it in Questions and Help, or write a ticket.

272
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 If it's moderation-related, don't talk to me about it.

273
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I'm not going to tell you anything. I'm going to make you write a ticket.

274
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 If you're worried about making a ticket, don't.

275
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 The moderation team are not going to bite your head off.

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 They are just going to ask for more information,

277
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 or they're going to let you know what's going on.

278
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 They are not going to be mad at you.

279
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 You could literally open a ticket and say,

280
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 "I like cheese," and they'll literally respond to you,

281
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 "That's great. Thank you. Goodbye."

282
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 It doesn't make tickets. Don't be scared.

283
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I will speak to you next time,

284
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 and I hope you're having a good day. Bye-bye.
