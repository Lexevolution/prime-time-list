1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, I'll make it top of the ounce. We'll go ahead and get started. Welcome to prime time, the office hours for Neos, for views of channels and misreading stuff.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Office hours for myself to answer questions about Neos. We have a bunch of questions, so I'm going to go through and get them started. Please do keep the questions coming though, because we will run out, and if we run out, we sit here in silence until office hours ends.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's take a look. So Snowy is asking about prime time podcast. Yeah, so sound or the service I'm using is shutting down in January, and so I don't see much reason to put any more effort into that.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am looking into alternatives that is taking a little bit longer though, because I want it to be dead simple, because hooray, thumbs up, simple is good.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For now, you can go ahead and use the Neos Wiki, which has transcriptions and audio files uploaded by Lex. Thank you very much for that.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So that's that for that question.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is it possible to mirror display to texture? No. What you're asking for there is screen sharing, and people think screen sharing should be really simple.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let me show you why that is not. Screen sharing is basically video streaming, and that's right now what the community are doing. They'll stream their screen to Twitch or some other live streaming service, and then they'll get it in as a texture in the game.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And people view the screen sharing feature that we might create as not that, but it literally is that. So we would have to do our own sort of video streaming somehow there. That's why we don't have that.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It is a feature on our roadmap. You can find that on the Neos GitHub and track that there.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Until that exists, there are community solutions streaming it to Twitch, streaming it to an RTMP server, streaming it to wherever the hell you want, provided it can get you out on RTMP feed.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's cool. You can't just share a screen that's not that simple.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Next question. And Alex says, will a new podcast feed be created or should someone in the community do that? Please, as the community member, don't do that.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Lex is trying bits of software, which is OK. What I don't want is anyone uploading it in a sort of RSS podcast Spotify format that isn't me, because then we start dealing with impersonation and it becomes a problem.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I hate it when that kind of stuff happens. You end up with sort of like, there are 20 different locations where you can listen to primetime and none of them are official because someone got bored one day and decided to upload it, which is why the current situation is better than we've got.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That is unfortunate that Sounder just decided to sort of up and close down shop, but we'll see. Something I've been thinking about is maybe moving the office hours over to some other host or some other tool.

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Sounder also recently emailed me a bunch of tools that they recommend, which is nice of them. I ideally don't want anything self hosted or if it is self hosted, I want it to make sense being self hosted.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
An example would be some sort of automated process to get it to the wiki, but then we don't get RSS when it gets Spotify publishing. It's a mess.

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
For now, the wiki is perfectly fine. It just doesn't let you know that it's happening. But if you remember when the event is, which is right now, then you can go ahead and check the wiki a couple of hours after that. It should be up two days.

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let us move on to additional questions rather than speaking about the office hours over and over again, which is it's fired. It's just a little bit meta. Let's speak about Neos.

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So Ozzy has a question about a sync issue of request weight too large. That is actually explicitly covered on the stock sync page and everything I have to say about stock sync is on that wiki page because I wrote it.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Anything in addition that I will gain about that will also be on that page because I'm like very tired of dealing with sync issues, basically. So I only ever update that page whenever I have anything new.

23
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Because I'm just tired, right? There's like four or five sync issues per day. We are working on resolving that. The update issues, et cetera.

24
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There are specific guidances for that too many requests problem. I have noticed a really good way of solving that is to stop saving worlds. I have a lot of people that I'm aware of who will continually save new versions of their worlds for no real reason.

25
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They come up with a system that either lets you keep the same copy of a world over multiple iterations. You might have a working copy that isn't public and then a public copy that might be two copies. But no, these people have got sort of like 11 copies of the same world.

26
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That can lead to that problem quite quickly because saving the world is more strenuous on the cloud than saving items. And then the other solution to that is to think about what you're saving.

27
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I also see a lot of people who work on a project in a world and save it to that world. Let's say, I don't know, you're making a panel that does some cool wizardry stuff. They'll save it into a world and then continue to save that world. Grab the panel, save it to your inventory.

28
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It will have a lot less issues syncing. Trust me. Like, you know, there's no need to basically there's no need to continually make new worlds is what I'm saying.

29
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, we don't have good version management tools, but, like, that's no excuse to also, like, double those problems, right? Also make sure you're making use of group storage as well where applicable.

30
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I get tired of passing world over the round when there's no group available. You're hosting the world today so you can save a new version of it and add one to the version number and I'm like, no, can you load the one from the group?

31
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The request rate one is literally, like, everything I have to say about it is on the wiki and stuff like that.

32
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Any additional questions, please do drop them in that text thread and I'll get to them in the order that they appear. There are currently no questions so I'll go ahead and mute and wait for questions.

33
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Any comments to the latest carol post? No. No comments. The last time I was aware of the server costs, they were in the range of, like, the sort of 3 to 5,000 range per month, which is why I'm continually telling people not to cancel their patreon because at a certain point the cloud will become at risk.

34
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But just lower it to the amount that they need for storage and that way it's still being paid for. People always say, like, oh, it just goes to carol's pockets and it's, like, no, it also pays for the storage.

35
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
As an example here, if you upload a gigabyte of data on your free account, we're paying for that.

36
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If you upgrade to patreon and you have 25 gigabytes of data and you use that entire 25 gigabytes of data while paying for it, great. We're kind of, like, net neutral there, right?

37
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You know, you're paying for it, money comes straight out of our account and goes into the server costs.

38
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But on the various things that you can do to, you know, mess around with storage, you can get to the point where it's, like, cool, I've got, like, five terabytes of storage for free and I'm like, great, thank you for putting your cloud at risk.

39
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Beyond the cloud storage source, though, I have no idea. I just know that those are automatic. Like, it's a big pile of money and the server costs come off the top of that big pile of money.

40
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I want to, once we get all this resolved, I want to sort of adopt an approach where we actually have the information as public as we can be.

41
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Now, there's information, of course, that we can't give out publicly, but there's so much stuff that we can that just, like, it doesn't, like, matter.

42
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We don't give it out because no one really does give it out. There's no real, like, harm in doing it.

43
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
A good example of this is a live streaming provider called Glimmish.

44
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Glimmish publicly discloses how much money is going through their business and it's beautiful.

45
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You know, they don't share anything private, like the names and addresses of their employees or anything like that, but they're like, hey, guys, we made this much money on subscriptions because they have subscriptions like Twitch.

46
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And this much was taken with fees and costs and, you know, tax, et cetera, and we gave this much out to you, the creators.

47
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And it's a lot better way to frame the whole revenue split that exists on live streaming platforms.

48
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:59,000
For those unaware, there's a whole big hurrah right now because Twitch is switching to a 50-50 model, whereas it used to be a 70-30 model. YouTube, I believe, is still 70-30, as in the creator gets 70%, YouTube takes 30%.

49
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But what you can do if you start sharing those fees is you can, like, explain with a better conversation, hey, guys, the reason why this is 50-50 or whatever it is is because although it looks like 50-50,

50
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the government actually takes 25 of our 50, so we get nothing, and then it looks a lot better, right? At that point, you have the lion's share of that, too.

51
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Additionally, they show how much money they made via t-shirt sales, which is, like, usually nothing.

52
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Merchandise is a really good moneymaker. If you can sell a lot, if you can't sell a lot, it's pointless.

53
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Moving forward to additional questions rather than me talking about streaming all day, which I could totally do, but I'm not going to.

54
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Rob says I'm interested in getting better deformations on my characters. Is there a way to integrate trained machine learning models matched as a deformer?

55
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No. That wouldn't be possible right now. You probably have to open up a GitHub issue for that.

56
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Better deformations occur with better weight painting. You can get, like, some really, really crazy weight painting that does a really good job.

57
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
An avatar that just comes to mind, which, like, people in this chat might say, like, that's a bad example because of XYZ reason.

58
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I got it, right? It's an example I can remember, and I'm on the spot here, is the hyena avatar.

59
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I see a lot in Neos, though that by default has a lot of layers of clothing, which I believe are all separatable, as in you can take bits of it off, right?

60
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And the weight painting is set up such that, like, there's no clipping that I've noticed, and everything just, like, flows and looks good.

61
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now, I've made avatars. I've made avatars with clothing. It takes me forever to get to the point where, you know, if you bend your elbow, your elbow doesn't shoot out the back of your clothing.

62
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In some cases, avatar creators will do something where they add a blend shape for when you're wearing clothing or it just, like, makes your arm look like a pipe cleaner.

63
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But that's really, like, not the way that you should do it. You can even see that in video games these days as well.

64
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Like, take a look at things like long flowing outfits, like skirts, dresses, robes, stuff like that in video games, and try and, like, swing your character around as fast as you can.

65
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,000
See how that looks and how that works. And then when you have a problem with defamation, think about, hey, these AAA people can do it, so I can probably do it. Let's take a look.

66
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There's also a video which I'm calling it famous because it's just in my head as, like, oh, my God, yes, from a user. I'll try and get a link for it.

67
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They talk about doing skirts for VRChat. And VRChat skirts are usually renowned for having, like, 200 bones and all being weight painted individually.

68
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And this user provided a guide to do a three or four bone skirt and have it absolutely perfect.

69
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And it's a really good video for basically, like, here's how you're meant to do a skirt with weight painting.

70
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And I found that really good because, like I said, I struggle with weight painting.

71
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So I'll look that up when we get a lot of questions. I'll drop it after in the chat here. I've got a bunch of questions to get through.

72
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Ozzy says, as for any other question, I recently got a facial tracker. I want to know if there's any advice you have for adjusting avatars, namely the avatar expression driver.

73
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I would like you to very much consider the avatars expression driver's properties and all of them.

74
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'd have to open it up. Actually, I do have the code base open so I can quote this from actual things.

75
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Sometimes I'm like, you need to specify the property that has volume in it. And someone comes back to me, like, three hours later.

76
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know which one it means. And then I open up the code base or I open up Neos.

77
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And it's not called volume. It's actually called, like, potato blah, blah, blah. I've just misremembered it.

78
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The problem is it's sometimes difficult for me to distinguish between my ability to go to that component and then have memory about it.

79
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then what that component has actually called. Sometimes I don't remember what the property is called.

80
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I just know which order it is or what it looks like visually, not what it's called in terms of words.

81
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So now I'm here. Yes. So take a look at the volume source and silence source.

82
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Make sure that those are specified in your expression driver.

83
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The volume source can come directly from a volume meter.

84
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The silence source can basically be sort of one minus the volume meter.

85
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You can also do that with the sill or silence thing on the Visum analyzer.

86
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There's like a Visum analyzer bar which will measure if you're not speaking.

87
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Those are very important. Once you've hooked those up, you can use volume suppression weight across the board.

88
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Now volume suppression weight is so difficult because it wasn't really explained that I typed it up at some point.

89
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't remember where I put that though. No searches across the entirety of the Discord.

90
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Great. Volume suppression. Maybe I did put it on the wiki.

91
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Help if I could spell suppression. There we go.

92
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Volume suppression did not match anything.

93
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Volume suppression. Ah, I put it in. I love this.

94
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's document stuff in a really obscure location.

95
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Here are my raw notes on volume suppression stuff.

96
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Volume suppression is very important. What volume suppression does when it's set up correctly.

97
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I know that's a lot of information, but go for it.

98
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Volume suppression when set up correctly will basically reduce the amount that an expression affects your blend shapes whilst you're speaking.

99
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And the reason why that's good is because it's often the case that when you're speaking, you'll make face shapes that match expression shapes.

100
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
A good example here might be sticking your tongue out, right?

101
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The face tracker might detect that you're sticking your tongue out, but it's just because you're saying one of the phonemes.

102
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Phonemes are the names for the individual mouth movements you do, and they're language independent.

103
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The phonemes that you do might include a tongue flick or a tongue poke.

104
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Some phonemes do have that, and the face tracker is like, you're poking your tongue out.

105
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And then in the middle of a serious sentence, you're like, we're gathered here today to give our condolences to this massive cheeseboard that Prime consumed in one sitting.

106
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And in the middle of that, you're smiling, winking, putting your tongue out, doing the bedroomized blend shape, and it's just like, what?

107
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Whereas if you configure the volume suppression way, it'll basically be like, all right, there is volume coming out of their microphone.

108
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I will suppress these expressions.

109
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So do take a look at that one.

110
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I have issues on a variety of avatars where the eyebrows on the avatar were basically doing sort of like sine waves because loads of blend shapes were firing at once.

111
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And so you could sort of music equalizer my eyebrows at one point, and that fixed by doing a bunch of volume suppression weight stuff.

112
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Additionally, the regular Viseme analyzer, I know this is a long explanation, but hey, documentation.

113
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The direct Viseme driver, just getting the name because the direct Viseme driver also has voice mouth suppress weight.

114
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't know if it's in my notes, but do take a look at that one as well.

115
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'd have to look how that one works.

116
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That one just like jump scared me.

117
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But you can put the mouth tracking source into the direct Viseme driver as well.

118
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And in that case, what it'll do is if you're not speaking, it can still detect the Viseme shapes and activate those based on that, which is a great way to get around the whole multiple blend shapes being, I'm sorry,

119
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
multiple sources driving the same blend shape problem.

120
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It allows you to drive all of the Viseme blend shapes using your mouth, which means that when you're not talking, you can still do things like OO or E or R, R being a common one for opening your mouth.

121
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You know, when you go to the doctor, like say R, right, you can do that by assigning the mouth tracking source to that.

122
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Of course, if you have enough blend shapes to not require that, go for it.

123
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But there you go.

124
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just a random anecdote whilst you're here.

125
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If you have a blend shape, which is triggered either via the facial tracker or via gestures or anything like that, that involves closing your eyes.

126
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You know, some people do it.

127
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They're like my eyes closed.

128
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Consider not doing that and instead consider going to the eye manager and using I think it's like I close override there because if you do that, I close override.

129
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It will signal to the eye managers to stop you from blinking.

130
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Because what I see on a ton of avatars is their eyes are closed due to a gesture, but the eye manager is still desperately trying to make them blink.

131
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And so what you get is what I call like a closed eye blink.

132
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But it's no issue, but like if you really want finesse, go take a look at the eye manager and see if you can get around that.

133
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It can suppress the blinks if you set some of those properties.

134
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's also great because again, multiple blend shapes, multiple drivers, right?

135
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You won't need two eye closed blend shapes.

136
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You need one blink blend shape for each eye and then you can use the stuff.

137
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The subtract limits.

138
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah, I have no idea how those work.

139
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'll have to take a look at those.

140
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I wonder what those were.

141
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I seem to remember as well there was like something in the eye manager that was designed to enable texture based eyes and texture based visemes to work a little bit better.

142
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I can't remember what that is.

143
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The eye manager is amazing.

144
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
There's loads of stuff that can be done there.

145
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So do take a look at that.

146
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm going to move on to the next question because I've been talking for a long, long time about that particular question.

147
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Hanu says, where do subs and bits money go from the newest Twitch channel?

148
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Two bank accounts controlled by Carol.

149
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Don't know where they go based on that.

150
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So with that, I believe we are done on questions.

151
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you have any other questions, please do let me know and I will get back to you.

152
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Mike, that's a good question, which is what's a good way for having multiple languages of text for a world or object?

153
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I've seen a bunch of ways to do that.

154
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I think the simplest way I've seen to do that is like a value multiplexer where you assign each language that you support an ID and then use a dynamic variable to specify which which language ID that you're using.

155
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The end goal for that is for us to open up the translation system that we use for the rest of Nios's locale to you guys for custom locale files.

156
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Currently, we're restricted to just one file and we're already seeing the sort of stresses of that.

157
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:38,000
For example, all of the Nios the universe translation strings are in the main locale file and there is no way that that should ever happen.

158
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But alas, it has.

159
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There's a bunch of stuff in the Japanese community area where they do their best to accommodate Korean and English, which may show you some alternative ways of doing that.

160
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's the way I've done it in the past.

161
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I've also actually just sort of like had to pop the locale system because I can do that so that it has those strings in there.

162
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, you should also when you're building UI, look through the locale files that we have and see if there's any local strings.

163
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You can just steal things like OK, yes, cancel, no, are probably in the locale files.

164
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You can just steal those and use our locale system and you'll get however many languages we have that one word like yes or OK will be translated for all of those languages.

165
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Big question here from Max who says, I ran into an issue of a user.

166
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They had more than five hundred and twelve depth of children object, which prevented them from learning a world.

167
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is there any reason it's why the max depth limit is five twelve?

168
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Would you happen to know why I let you save and not load the object?

169
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, this is an interesting one, and it's caused by lack of standards.

170
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So Neos being Indy in air quotes, early access in air quotes, beta in air quotes application that is developed by one person.

171
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It doesn't have many standards.

172
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So a corporate setting or maybe even like a triple A setting a limit like five twelve.

173
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Wherever the hell it is, would have involved like meetings, paperwork and emails, and I'm not saying Neos needs to do that.

174
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But the point is, once that limit is decided, it will be standardized everywhere.

175
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So a component that a slot depth everywhere in Neos would be five twelve.

176
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And it would probably link to.

177
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In a roundabout fashion, however you want to do it in C sharp, it would link to the same configuration variable or property or maybe even a death hashtag defined in C sharp, such that it is like mandatedly defined everywhere as a standard.

178
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If you want to look that up, it's something called like magic strings or magic numbers in code. It's basically like if you have a number, link it to a variable and then you can document what that variable means.

179
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You can also change it, which means that you aren't in the future magically hunting for that one.

180
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
As a good example here.

181
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What was hard coded somewhere recently?

182
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, yeah, I was looking at how noise works in Neos, and we use this library called fast noise.

183
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And it does this really weird thing where like it's noise like members.

184
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So like fields and functions and whatever you want to call them within.

185
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Within its library, they.

186
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Do this weird thing where they had a return type I didn't recognize, so I'll just post an example here.

187
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They have this return type.

188
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And I'm like, that's a bit weird. What the hell is FN decimal? And so I looked it up and FN decimal is defined using C sharp defines.

189
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Where if you enable the C sharp definition of use doubles, then FN decimal will be a double. Otherwise it will be a single.

190
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So that's that standardization, right? It's we're putting this in place and we're using FN decimal because then that means with one click of our build, we can swap between using system double and system single everywhere.

191
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
In the code base.

192
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And it was a tangent into like development. But yeah, that's that.

193
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
We'd have to probably like overhaul a lot of stuff to like get that standardized.

194
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's probably just like a weird edge case. There's going to be a bunch of them.

195
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There was another edge case I found where it's just like, cool, don't know why, but cool. I think it's in the value graph recorder. I've just opened it up.

196
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, here we go. So the value graph recorder, for those who do know, that is what is allows you to, well, that's what I'm saying, right?

197
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So in saving, we use a different standard depth limit than in loading.

198
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Maybe I'd have to look it up, right? So somewhere in the save routine, there is.

199
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
A number greater than 512 and then somewhere in the loader 18, there is a number less than 512.

200
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'd have to look into it more, but that's probably what's happened. I've noticed that a couple of times back onto that example.

201
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So the value graph recorder basically will record graphs into an array that you can't touch, but it's used for the graph measures.

202
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The line waveform measures that exist. And there's a points value on that component.

203
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And that is essentially just the size of the array that holds those values for that graph.

204
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I usually have about 1000. That's usually good. If you want like really short term daily, you want 250.

205
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But I found out the other day, the maximum value for that is 524288.

206
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm like, cool, is that a binary number? I don't know off the top of my head, but that is the maximum number of values.

207
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You could have a value graph recorder. I don't know. There is a comment here which says limit to roughly half a million values.

208
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I would say that 524000 is actually over half a million by 24000.

209
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But that number was there and it was decided on. I don't know the reason why it was decided on there, which leads into sort of anecdote.

210
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Comments in code get a lot of bad reputation because, you know, you get stuff like, I'm typing, sorry.

211
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You get people saying like, yeah, there's why we don't do comments on our code, because it's obvious what the code is doing.

212
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But what you should do with comments is explain why the code is doing that.

213
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So in this case, it's really difficult because signing A to 1 is very difficult to describe.

214
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But maybe, you know, A being 1 is very important to the mathematics we're doing.

215
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So it's like, we need this to be 1 because of Pythagoras, right?

216
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And then like someone coming back through that code when they see that and they're like, hang on a minute, why is A 1?

217
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And they're like, oh, because of Pythagoras.

218
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Or maybe there's a link to a GitHub issue or some other issue tracking there that's like, this is why, here's the decision, here's the design document.

219
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That's good commenting, not just assign the value of 1 to A. It's ridiculous.

220
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So I'm seeing more of that in the Neos code base since I've joined, really.

221
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't know if I'm just sort of like accidentally encouraging that, but I do see a lot there.

222
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I also do it to help review sometimes, which is a little bit like a misnomer.

223
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You shouldn't do it to help reviews, but sometimes I do.

224
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You know, if I think like something is going to be stringently reviewed in a code review, I'll add some extra comments explaining why the hell that's happened.

225
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And usually that is a double duty, right?

226
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It means the next person coming through that code is just like, oh, that's why that code looks like a piece of crap because of these reasons.

227
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But sometimes it's like, it's there just for shouldn't be doing.

228
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But there we go.

229
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I can look into that one, Lex, if you would like.

230
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm going to go ahead and find that skirt video in the lull that we have and look into that, but we'll be ending off shortly.

231
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So if you guys have any more questions, do let me know, and I'll get to them as soon as I can.

232
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'll go find that VRChat skirt video just shortly.

233
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
All right. I come back from the land of mute to thank you, your skirt sucks, zero to hero.

234
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I haven't watched the video in a long time, so I don't remember it being that sort of brash in its wording.

235
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But it takes a common avatar that you saw in VRChat about the time it was uploaded, removes its like 12 skirt bones,

236
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and replaces it with three or four skirt bones, and shows you how to weight paint them successfully.

237
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's a really good video for me just saying like, I was learning weight painting can't just be throw bones at the problem.

238
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Because that's what I kept doing.

239
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And if you look at like AAA games, that's usually what they do because they're controlling the engine to do that.

240
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
They're like, yes, there is like a chest 22 bone.

241
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What the hell does that do?

242
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But in a situation like Neos and VRChat, you don't need as many bones.

243
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
All right. Let's go down.

244
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Lex says, why does your main avatar have obfuscated names to the bones and that specific method is on the things to list?

245
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Isn't simple avatar production enough?

246
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I did that a long time ago, and undoing it is difficult.

247
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That is why that exists.

248
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:12,000
There's this like problem with avatars where the longer that your avatar has been in Neos and has been edited, the less stuff makes sense.

249
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I think like the other week I found box child child child parented to a random part of my avatar with nothing on it.

250
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Not even a box mesh, strangely, which I of course just deleted.

251
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But at a certain point I thought it was a good idea to parent box child child child to my avatar for some reason and then save it.

252
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I don't know if something was parented to that like a system or something, but it wasn't doing anything then.

253
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So you did it.

254
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
All right, Rob, if you have a final question, do let me know.

255
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I will actually I'll go find the Haein avatar.

256
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I typed a really bad spelling of it into Google and it came up with a Hyundai car.

257
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If anyone knows the avatar I referred to and is able to actually spell it or has it bookmarked, please, please do drop it in the chat.

258
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I know some of you got it. I guarantee someone's got it. It's quite a popular avatar.

259
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think I see Arena has probably got it.

260
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah, there it is.

261
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Here you go. And I'll get the picture I was referring to.

262
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So in this outfit here, the jacket doesn't clip with, I don't know, clothing names, the tube top.

263
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And the shorts are just really good. And there's like I've never seen any trouble with the shoes.

264
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't know what to call those either, but I've just seen like nothing like the weight painting is really good on those.

265
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You can even kind of see it in that pose, right?

266
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The shorts are bending in a way that to me makes sense.

267
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Or sometimes when I make clothes and I bend the legs to test, I'm just like, what the hell is happening to those bones?

268
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Last question from Rob before we leave off here says are you guys hiring reading artists or any other type of 3D artist?

269
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Not currently. I'm not hiring anyone currently.

270
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That changes. I hopefully will let you know.

271
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I can't promise anything there, depending on how things change and who's doing it.

272
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That'll be it for today, though.

273
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Lex, I will look into that 512 issue.

274
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I guarantee that if I just search the code base for like 512, I'll probably find it.

275
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But I'll take a look.

276
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And I'll get back to you.

277
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Otherwise, thanks for attending.

278
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Thanks for your questions.

279
00:30:35,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'll talk to you soon.
