1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:03.040
Okay, welcome to office hours. It is time

2
0:00:03.640 --> 0:00:07.240
So if you have questions, please feel free to drop them into the office hours channel

3
0:00:07.240 --> 0:00:10.160
I'll get them answered in the order that they appear. Otherwise, we're gonna sit in

4
0:00:10.840 --> 0:00:12.720
unimaginable unending

5
0:00:12.720 --> 0:00:17.480
Silence mmm. Okay. We have a first question of the day, which is from specs

6
0:00:17.480 --> 0:00:21.840
Which says I've asked a bit before but it's been a while. So why not? I'm running ahead the server again

7
0:00:21.840 --> 0:00:23.840
I'm trying to get near

8
0:00:23.880 --> 0:00:25.980
Logs into an elk elastic stack

9
0:00:25.980 --> 0:00:31.420
unfortunately the timestamps and the s logs only have the time and not the date of an experience with such things any advice on how

10
0:00:31.420 --> 0:00:33.340
I might do this. Um

11
0:00:33.340 --> 0:00:36.780
Do they not have the date? I was not aware. Let me

12
0:00:38.020 --> 0:00:42.420
Just open up a log file just for my personal reference here. Yeah, they only have a

13
0:00:43.020 --> 0:00:47.140
Only have the time interesting. Um, you could probably base it on the

14
0:00:47.740 --> 0:00:53.460
Like the name of the file when you ingest things we do have the date in the name of the file there

15
0:00:53.460 --> 0:00:58.700
So maybe you can pass that out logging is actually something which I really really really want to improve

16
0:00:58.700 --> 0:01:03.420
Like we don't really use like a standard logging library right now, and I would love to get one situated

17
0:01:03.420 --> 0:01:08.280
I'd also get to one get one situated where you can kind of provide like a little bit of config to it

18
0:01:08.820 --> 0:01:14.840
So for example when a user has a problem with Neos and we know it's in an area. Let's say physics I can say

19
0:01:15.740 --> 0:01:23.320
Run Neos with this like command line flag and it will enable extra logging about physics because right now what happens is if we

20
0:01:23.320 --> 0:01:25.180
Needed say extra logging about our problem

21
0:01:25.180 --> 0:01:31.260
We would commit changes to Neos in everyone's sphere that would update the locking to include that information

22
0:01:31.260 --> 0:01:37.140
And then when it was fixed we would then on the next update remove that information and that would allow us to

23
0:01:38.500 --> 0:01:43.100
Stop doing that that would also allow us to not remove those log lines from the code

24
0:01:43.380 --> 0:01:46.460
I'm weird and and maybe a little bit sort of

25
0:01:46.460 --> 0:01:53.900
Obsessed with it, but if a log line exists in code it should exist forever because there's sometimes a lot of work that goes into

26
0:01:54.420 --> 0:02:01.060
Creating logs or creating specific log messages, and we shouldn't need to delete that we should just disable it if we don't need it anymore

27
0:02:01.580 --> 0:02:04.780
There's lots of libraries for doing that we're just not really using any of them

28
0:02:04.780 --> 0:02:07.900
So we need to that one improve a lot of the stuff there

29
0:02:10.020 --> 0:02:11.540
Next question from

30
0:02:11.540 --> 0:02:13.700
Actually, I'm gonna jump to specs is because it's a follow-up

31
0:02:13.700 --> 0:02:20.020
Who asks when the date rolls over does Neos create a new log file and you date will it continues the same file?

32
0:02:20.020 --> 0:02:22.980
I have no idea. I have no idea

33
0:02:22.980 --> 0:02:28.420
We'd have to have basically like a 24-hour session running and then see what happens at the date boundaries. I don't know

34
0:02:28.980 --> 0:02:33.460
So gun Griffin asks what restrictions can oppose filter apply

35
0:02:34.020 --> 0:02:38.980
Can it be manually clipped I use a raycast to tell it to limit the motion in that direction

36
0:02:38.980 --> 0:02:43.660
So a post filter has like a number of components that you can use

37
0:02:43.660 --> 0:02:47.400
I actually have the code base open which is a rare occurrence right now, but

38
0:02:48.100 --> 0:02:53.840
It does mean I can I can look them up all real quick for you, so I just find references to post filter

39
0:02:54.400 --> 0:02:56.080
okay, so

40
0:02:56.080 --> 0:02:58.080
You can do what's called a smoother

41
0:02:58.500 --> 0:03:00.580
post filter that one will sort of make your

42
0:03:01.140 --> 0:03:05.780
Controls smoothed Gable has an example of that inside Neos essentials gadgets

43
0:03:05.780 --> 0:03:09.980
Skibbles toy shop and then there's a weight in there and it feels like a heavy weight

44
0:03:09.980 --> 0:03:17.060
And that's because it's smooth lerped in you grabbing it. That's also good for like levers or heavy wheels or something

45
0:03:17.380 --> 0:03:21.740
There's a part in Fundamentally 8. This is a sideline, but hey we have time. There's not many questions

46
0:03:21.740 --> 0:03:27.260
there's a side part in Fundamentally 8 where you're you're descending through a building and there's this

47
0:03:27.760 --> 0:03:32.260
big wheel to open up part of this like basement level of a building and

48
0:03:32.260 --> 0:03:39.240
You need to spam like the x button on your controller to do it and the speedrunners of that game have sort of

49
0:03:39.780 --> 0:03:45.020
Narrowed down the mathematics of spamming that big wheel to a tee so they can get through as fast as possible

50
0:03:45.700 --> 0:03:47.700
If you can't do it on the first try

51
0:03:47.860 --> 0:03:53.860
Another member of your party in this rPG will then join you and then you have to spam it less because then there's two bodies

52
0:03:53.860 --> 0:03:55.860
On that wheel spinning it

53
0:03:55.940 --> 0:03:58.340
So that's a sideline. It's cool

54
0:03:58.340 --> 0:04:03.740
I know what they call it in the speedrunner community is like first try valve or whatever it is and it's very difficult

55
0:04:03.740 --> 0:04:06.100
It's like I don't know. I'm not gonna get this right

56
0:04:06.100 --> 0:04:10.620
It's like 120 button pushes over a period of like a minute or I don't know whatever the the limit is

57
0:04:10.620 --> 0:04:12.980
But that's what it's meant to you know meant to signify

58
0:04:13.780 --> 0:04:16.240
Hefty lifting would be a good use of that post filter

59
0:04:17.100 --> 0:04:19.240
Moving on post filters. There's a rotation

60
0:04:19.240 --> 0:04:28.000
a rotation constraint that prevents you from Rotating whilst you're holding it so things like again levers

61
0:04:28.000 --> 0:04:31.920
And wheels would be really good for that one. I haven't actually used that one a lot mostly because you know

62
0:04:32.720 --> 0:04:35.640
It uses similar things to a joint and joint scary

63
0:04:36.680 --> 0:04:42.840
Joint scary, there's pose offset that will basically offset you and a position in a rotation when you grab it

64
0:04:42.840 --> 0:04:46.400
I'm not really sure why you would use that but hey, it's there

65
0:04:46.400 --> 0:04:52.300
The one that is probably more applicable to guns actual question though is the box constraint

66
0:04:52.320 --> 0:04:58.160
So what the box constraint will do is when you grab something you only be able to move it in that box and because there's

67
0:04:58.160 --> 0:05:02.000
A box it's got three dimensions if you only want left and right make the box really

68
0:05:02.640 --> 0:05:06.720
Really short, but really wide or really deep just you know remove that height

69
0:05:06.720 --> 0:05:09.240
And then you don't need to be able to move it up and down stuff like that

70
0:05:09.240 --> 0:05:16.760
Manually clipped use a raycast to tell it to limit motion you would do that using the box constraint. That's

71
0:05:17.880 --> 0:05:24.120
All there is really to them if you want any more sort of other pose restrictions that you've got please do drop them a feature

72
0:05:24.120 --> 0:05:26.120
Request on the github and we'll get it sorted

73
0:05:27.360 --> 0:05:29.360
Whenever we can or if it's a good idea

74
0:05:30.200 --> 0:05:37.840
Remember when you're like asking for things like that ask for what you would like to happen rather than your intended approach

75
0:05:37.840 --> 0:05:40.560
So for example here and you're doing good in the way that you've asked it

76
0:05:40.560 --> 0:05:42.560
I'm just pointing out because there's an opportunity to

77
0:05:42.960 --> 0:05:47.160
Gun asked use a raycast to tell it to limit motion in that direction

78
0:05:47.160 --> 0:05:49.000
We don't need a raycast to do that

79
0:05:49.000 --> 0:05:53.640
You could use a raycast to do it and then calculate the the distance based on that

80
0:05:53.720 --> 0:05:59.280
But what we need is an ability to limit the range of motion the amount of motion, right?

81
0:05:59.280 --> 0:06:02.680
So that doesn't technically need a raycast that could be static. It could be dynamic

82
0:06:02.760 --> 0:06:07.040
So make sure you kind of separate those two so that we don't get lost in the sort of like

83
0:06:07.040 --> 0:06:12.280
Why would you need a raycast and said it's like oh you could use a raycast to have this effect

84
0:06:13.080 --> 0:06:18.400
Moving on to our next question we have from unnamed cyborg cat has anyone tried creating a physics gun yes

85
0:06:18.400 --> 0:06:24.040
I believe quite a few people have just off the top of my head. I would probably go off. I wrote

86
0:06:24.040 --> 0:06:27.560
Sorry, we're really like scariest mod, so maybe they would know if someone has one or maybe they made them on themselves

87
0:06:27.560 --> 0:06:32.000
I'm not sure, but sorry would be my target to go ask that particular question

88
0:06:32.880 --> 0:06:36.520
Specs asks lately myself and friends have experienced issues joining sessions. Yes

89
0:06:36.520 --> 0:06:41.160
We're aware of that one I think we're looking into it today

90
0:06:41.160 --> 0:06:46.760
It's probably just the relay server like pooping again, so we'll take a look at it should be fixed today

91
0:06:46.760 --> 0:06:53.960
If not, I will I'll bash bash fruits around a little bit too. It's fixed gently of course just like that. Hey fix it um

92
0:06:55.000 --> 0:07:00.520
Really almost too fuzzy. It's a way to swap into another avatar. That's in the world via logics. Yes

93
0:07:00.960 --> 0:07:02.960
There is the equip avatar

94
0:07:02.960 --> 0:07:05.000
Node is inside the avatars folder

95
0:07:05.000 --> 0:07:10.600
So cool like just take a look at it. You can find inside my public folder

96
0:07:10.600 --> 0:07:14.960
I think it's in like public proper prime tools. There is the avatar equip

97
0:07:15.600 --> 0:07:19.920
Tooltip that basically you can just point at an avatar and equip it it sounds weird

98
0:07:19.920 --> 0:07:25.720
But there was a bug for like one update where you couldn't equip avatars that are in the world and so I made that tool

99
0:07:25.720 --> 0:07:26.760
quickly

100
0:07:26.760 --> 0:07:29.760
It's also got I don't think actually release that version

101
0:07:30.880 --> 0:07:33.880
No, turkey turkey edited it. There's one way you can

102
0:07:33.880 --> 0:07:40.280
Select an avatar with secondary and then duplicate and equip it over into

103
0:07:41.440 --> 0:07:43.160
Like the other ones there

104
0:07:43.160 --> 0:07:47.220
That will just change the avatar not teleporting equip avatar will just change your avatar

105
0:07:47.220 --> 0:07:50.640
It shouldn't teleport you the context menu does teleport you as far as I'm right

106
0:07:51.360 --> 0:07:57.600
Name cybercat asks about Hypno space outlaw. I have no idea what that is and so no I have not checked that out

107
0:07:57.600 --> 0:08:03.960
electronic asks so I have a user parent or one of my avatars and users can walk around on a box collider with it when

108
0:08:03.960 --> 0:08:08.320
I move manually they tend to stay in place, but when I move my stick even slowly they tend to fall off

109
0:08:08.320 --> 0:08:13.440
I've been advised to use a box collider for the parent that is fairly large to basically catch them is the better way to do

110
0:08:13.440 --> 0:08:15.960
This um no, that's what you'll have to do

111
0:08:17.120 --> 0:08:23.000
Look into how the character parent who works this comes a lot a lot in elevators basically if you stop colliding with that

112
0:08:23.000 --> 0:08:26.840
Call a collider it will be parent you and so what's happening

113
0:08:26.840 --> 0:08:32.680
There is probably like an update order or something like that is happening to decollide them from the collider

114
0:08:34.000 --> 0:08:39.840
So that's cool. I didn't think it actually got taken down taken down. We didn't delete it

115
0:08:39.840 --> 0:08:43.780
I don't think we delete anything for that's a reference of Turks tool being taken down. I think it has

116
0:08:45.000 --> 0:08:47.600
So you just keep an eye on that collider make sure they're not

117
0:08:47.600 --> 0:08:52.960
De-colliding with it you might be able to hook up some light logics to try and figure that out a little bit more

118
0:08:53.560 --> 0:08:56.040
Because you can detect when they de-collide from it

119
0:08:56.200 --> 0:09:01.120
You know like children count change or something like that and maybe sort of narrow down

120
0:09:01.600 --> 0:09:08.440
What's going on there moving course to Fuzzy's question is there a recommended theoretical discovered maximum number of children you compare it before things get upset

121
0:09:09.400 --> 0:09:12.120
Not that I'm aware of you'd probably end up in issues

122
0:09:12.120 --> 0:09:19.160
quite rapidly, but like not quickly at all you should never have to worry about it

123
0:09:19.160 --> 0:09:23.920
This does come up a lot as well people worry sometimes too much like I understand the worry

124
0:09:23.920 --> 0:09:29.960
But if there is like a performance problem or like a limitation or something like that

125
0:09:29.960 --> 0:09:34.720
Then we should take care of it with you like we should take care of that for you

126
0:09:34.720 --> 0:09:37.160
So you don't have to worry about it. No, we see that's

127
0:09:37.160 --> 0:09:42.560
Children a parent can have children a parent. Oh, yeah, that's a different thing. Yeah number of slot children

128
0:09:42.560 --> 0:09:43.040
There is a limit

129
0:09:43.040 --> 0:09:48.280
I thought you were talking about trees like descending down children parent children children children children like a branching tree

130
0:09:48.480 --> 0:09:53.280
That's probably got no limit, but number of slot children. There is a limit. I forget what that is again

131
0:09:53.280 --> 0:09:55.400
You shouldn't worry about it. It's probably close to one of those other

132
0:09:56.400 --> 0:09:58.240
boundaries yeah, yeah

133
0:09:58.240 --> 0:09:59.520
256

134
0:09:59.520 --> 0:10:06.700
You shouldn't like it shouldn't like it shouldn't you shouldn't have shouldn't have anything there there are then of course as he brings up the

135
0:10:06.700 --> 0:10:12.460
JSON limits as well sometimes there are limits on on JSON when saving it good example here being that folder

136
0:10:12.460 --> 0:10:16.860
So I prevented it from being created, but I haven't obviously what's going on

137
0:10:16.860 --> 0:10:20.340
I haven't fixed up so that it will then be okay in the actual UI

138
0:10:20.660 --> 0:10:23.780
There's people that were creating folders that had incredibly long names

139
0:10:23.780 --> 0:10:27.320
They were using colors or ASCII art to make their public folders

140
0:10:27.460 --> 0:10:31.700
that was breaking stuff because the folder length was too long and

141
0:10:31.700 --> 0:10:36.940
Some of the validation just just couldn't handle the link for that. It was related to the JSON and synchronization

142
0:10:37.060 --> 0:10:41.660
So I put like a sort of stopgap on that in the create directory menu

143
0:10:41.660 --> 0:10:42.740
So you can't make them really long

144
0:10:42.740 --> 0:10:48.620
But I haven't then gone back and done the rest of the operations there to clean up from behind next on was to

145
0:10:49.500 --> 0:10:54.540
Has who says on unis player not sure if the right place to ask is there some kind of general plan to simplify

146
0:10:54.540 --> 0:11:00.500
I knew as his UI. Yep. There is that's the UI overhaul roadmap. Also. Take a look at the myths page on our wiki

147
0:11:00.500 --> 0:11:03.500
and this page is sometimes quite sort of

148
0:11:04.380 --> 0:11:06.940
Bludgeoning in the way that it's worded. It's not intended like that

149
0:11:06.940 --> 0:11:11.380
It's just intended to be as quick and as blunt as possible just to get in the message out there

150
0:11:11.980 --> 0:11:19.380
So we want to improve the UI we know it's bad. We are going to improve it like it's not intentionally this way

151
0:11:19.380 --> 0:11:22.700
It's not on purpose that it's terrible. It's just not finished

152
0:11:22.780 --> 0:11:25.540
We will finish it at some point in the future

153
0:11:25.540 --> 0:11:32.500
TBD fuzzy is there a nice way to discover and not off an object exists XYZ other than looping through everything from root down

154
0:11:32.900 --> 0:11:38.660
Checking yeah collider. So again, I guess happens a lot and I keep hearing about it. So I'll keep saying it

155
0:11:39.180 --> 0:11:40.660
colliders

156
0:11:40.660 --> 0:11:47.220
People worry about colliders being Aggie or colliders being problematic if you do them correctly, they're totally fine

157
0:11:47.620 --> 0:11:53.420
So what you would do there is probably take a small and I say small because you're trying to look for a singular point a small

158
0:11:53.420 --> 0:11:55.420
sphere active Collider

159
0:11:55.460 --> 0:11:57.380
teleport it to that position and

160
0:11:57.380 --> 0:12:02.460
Detective any collisions occur and then turn it off if you do that all within like a couple of update cycles. You're fine

161
0:12:02.460 --> 0:12:04.060
There's no like it's fine

162
0:12:04.060 --> 0:12:06.580
That would enable you to sort of see what's going on there now

163
0:12:06.580 --> 0:12:10.260
You could technically do sort of weird bounding box stuff

164
0:12:10.260 --> 0:12:15.560
But you would have to look through all the children there if you want like a dynamic access without looping through the children and descending

165
0:12:15.980 --> 0:12:17.980
Colliders the way to go

166
0:12:17.980 --> 0:12:23.820
And speaking of that, maybe I can tutorialize it at some point head on over to the creator jam

167
0:12:23.820 --> 0:12:27.720
Not this week's but last week's creator jam that was about bread and carbohydrates

168
0:12:27.800 --> 0:12:35.140
There is a small wheat farm there where I I use active colliders. I I use them. They're good

169
0:12:35.140 --> 0:12:36.540
They work well

170
0:12:36.540 --> 0:12:38.980
And you can kind of see how I advise doing that over there

171
0:12:38.980 --> 0:12:44.260
You can grow wheat and then harvest it and grind it into flour because that's part of the cup jam if to so

172
0:12:44.260 --> 0:12:45.780
It was a good job

173
0:12:45.780 --> 0:12:51.660
Etronus points out that the object that you're trying to discover must have a collider that is correct if an object doesn't have a collider

174
0:12:51.980 --> 0:12:57.500
It's kind of a bug sort of like if it's like an art world or it's your own world cool

175
0:12:57.500 --> 0:13:03.080
But if it's someone else's world don't spawn stuff that doesn't have colliders that happens a lot with sort of like

176
0:13:03.080 --> 0:13:04.980
I don't know half finished

177
0:13:04.980 --> 0:13:09.500
projects or something like I'll go into a world after it's been open for a couple of hours and it just be like

178
0:13:09.860 --> 0:13:13.740
There is a sphere the size of the Sun in the background

179
0:13:13.740 --> 0:13:18.060
Why is no one removed it and they're like we can't find it. It has no collider, and I'm just like

180
0:13:19.500 --> 0:13:21.500
Really?

181
0:13:21.980 --> 0:13:23.880
Active colliders active cut yet

182
0:13:23.880 --> 0:13:30.740
You just I know that we have the pseudo physics via the collider at the character colliders that are active, etc

183
0:13:30.740 --> 0:13:32.980
Just just don't do it. Just don't do it

184
0:13:34.940 --> 0:13:38.740
Electronus points out additional clarifications about collider types double check my table

185
0:13:38.740 --> 0:13:44.060
you'll see there, but there's something there an avatar would do that because avatars have the the

186
0:13:44.580 --> 0:13:46.580
Colliders on them that do have collision

187
0:13:47.220 --> 0:13:54.060
If you wanted to go for the non collision ones then maybe maybe raycast to help there like kind of it like picturing like this

188
0:13:54.060 --> 0:13:55.060
weird sort of

189
0:13:55.060 --> 0:13:59.860
Robot that flies around the map that just goes like okay couldn't get a collision with my active Collider

190
0:13:59.940 --> 0:14:06.180
Pupupu of a bunch of raycast couldn't get a collision with my actual raycast cool. Guess there must not be anything here

191
0:14:06.180 --> 0:14:13.140
But yeah, I don't don't descend madly through the through the hierarchy of just drive yourself mad. Oh

192
0:14:17.580 --> 0:14:21.020
I'm sorry. I did miss that question. Thank you for re-asking it. I try not to

193
0:14:21.700 --> 0:14:26.300
Crafting asks is it possible to make any contact means that aren't arcs. Yes, if you don't use our context menu system

194
0:14:26.620 --> 0:14:33.180
I said lots of people do it. They put like UI or tooling that exists on their avatar

195
0:14:33.180 --> 0:14:35.180
That is not arc related

196
0:14:35.180 --> 0:14:39.740
I guess a good example here is prominent that comes to mind is there is jacks like

197
0:14:40.020 --> 0:14:45.220
Wrist gauntlet thing that has a lot of sort of menus and stuff on it on arcs

198
0:14:45.940 --> 0:14:49.020
There's lots of people that do sort of customized avatars that go extreme

199
0:14:49.180 --> 0:14:52.540
And they've got all sorts of like yeah, just imagine like Iron Man menus in your head

200
0:14:52.660 --> 0:14:58.300
There's lots of those that exist those aren't arcs, but if you only use our context menu systems, then nope they gotta be ox

201
0:14:58.300 --> 0:15:05.180
And Griffin asks can you reference an item by relative hierarchy path Robin specifics lock ref no?

202
0:15:06.620 --> 0:15:12.260
What you're asking therefore is like almost CSS style searching

203
0:15:13.100 --> 0:15:15.540
in HTML you can kind of search for like

204
0:15:16.580 --> 0:15:22.420
Look for any cube which is under a sphere like you can totally do that in web programming web development

205
0:15:22.420 --> 0:15:24.900
It's totally easy to do, but you cannot do that there

206
0:15:24.900 --> 0:15:28.460
You might be able to do in the future and the reason I say that is whenever

207
0:15:28.660 --> 0:15:33.620
Fruits puts out something that has a text box like dynamic variables parent data links

208
0:15:34.260 --> 0:15:41.300
Tag slot names all sorts of stuff like that. He'll sometimes reserve characters so for example inside dynamic variable system

209
0:15:41.300 --> 0:15:46.260
There are reserved characters that you can't use for your dynamic variables the reason why those are reserved is so hey

210
0:15:46.260 --> 0:15:50.500
Maybe we can do more more complicated string matching later

211
0:15:50.500 --> 0:15:55.140
I'll follow this up the question with is it just search by name. Yeah, there's fine child by name which

212
0:15:55.780 --> 0:15:58.380
Confined a child by the name. There's no

213
0:15:59.060 --> 0:16:01.980
Fancy searching you can do there this fine child by tag

214
0:16:01.980 --> 0:16:06.620
There's no fancy searching you can do there to descend also reminder tags are singular

215
0:16:07.460 --> 0:16:10.100
Some people get confused about the has tag

216
0:16:11.540 --> 0:16:18.300
Node there the reason has tag exists is because it is a shortcut rather than doing get tagged equally cool

217
0:16:18.300 --> 0:16:20.620
It's like has tag instead

218
0:16:20.620 --> 0:16:26.620
It's it's like one or two less nodes fuzzy ask is there a way to get sound from one place to appear to be coming

219
0:16:26.620 --> 0:16:28.620
from another place yes um

220
0:16:29.100 --> 0:16:31.100
You know got a video on that one

221
0:16:31.100 --> 0:16:34.580
Let me let me see if I can find the video for you, and we'll take a look

222
0:16:35.460 --> 0:16:37.460
Yeah, yeah remote audio

223
0:16:38.460 --> 0:16:40.460
Essentially though what you do is you?

224
0:16:41.180 --> 0:16:43.180
you do

225
0:16:43.180 --> 0:16:46.220
Anywhere, there's an audio output component is where?

226
0:16:46.220 --> 0:16:52.420
The audio actually comes out of audio output is the is the component that plays the audio so let's say you have a music clip

227
0:16:52.940 --> 0:16:54.860
They exist in the world and you play it there

228
0:16:54.860 --> 0:16:56.220
There's usually an audio output on it

229
0:16:56.220 --> 0:17:02.860
You know the green the green sort of circle thing you could go into that audio clip and you can remove the audio output and wire

230
0:17:02.860 --> 0:17:08.500
Up an audio output elsewhere. That's what a lot of the sort of video players DJ systems

231
0:17:09.260 --> 0:17:14.460
Surround sound systems do they like take your audio data, and they wire it to different audio sources

232
0:17:14.460 --> 0:17:19.620
That's how you get sort of audio around there also check out my public folder. I think it's under gadgets

233
0:17:19.620 --> 0:17:24.820
I've got a tin can telephone here remember you know tie two tin cans together a piece of string and then spoke into them

234
0:17:24.820 --> 0:17:27.900
I've got that working that uses remote audio to do that

235
0:17:29.020 --> 0:17:34.180
That's a bit complicated like if you unpack it. You'll probably go. Oh, that's because I made it like many years ago, but

236
0:17:34.900 --> 0:17:40.580
What it essentially does is it redirects your audio output when you're holding a can to the opposite can as an audio output?

237
0:17:40.580 --> 0:17:46.900
Moving on to OZ question may have asked this before but is finding a child by tag more efficient than funny by name given the most

238
0:17:46.900 --> 0:17:48.900
Objects don't even have text search through

239
0:17:52.020 --> 0:17:56.380
Find child by tag let's take a look how this works

240
0:17:57.380 --> 0:17:59.380
instance finds child

241
0:17:59.380 --> 0:18:01.380
cool, and then

242
0:18:01.380 --> 0:18:04.380
t find child by name

243
0:18:04.380 --> 0:18:12.060
t find child by name does find child does find child index of

244
0:18:15.420 --> 0:18:22.460
Technically, they're about the same. They're probably about the same the reason I say that is because find child by tag

245
0:18:24.060 --> 0:18:25.980
has to do

246
0:18:25.980 --> 0:18:31.500
Predicate based searching where it's a sort of process each slot and go through the list

247
0:18:31.500 --> 0:18:37.460
But find child by name has to do a lot of string stuff, so they're like about the same

248
0:18:38.100 --> 0:18:42.500
Find child by name doesn't have to do any sort of predicate matching you can just do a for each so

249
0:18:43.420 --> 0:18:48.820
Honestly, you shouldn't have to worry. This is again what I talk about where I'm like if you're worried about performance

250
0:18:48.820 --> 0:18:52.460
Let us worry about that. We don't do it right now as much as we should

251
0:18:53.220 --> 0:18:56.600
But we did do it with one note that doesn't be released yet

252
0:18:56.600 --> 0:18:59.840
but will be other is just count occurrences fruits, and I had a

253
0:18:59.840 --> 0:19:03.440
Disagreement and this time is a polite disagreement these happen all the time of programming

254
0:19:03.440 --> 0:19:10.960
They're amazing and you should learn to understand that those happen that they're cool about the performance of a counter currencies node

255
0:19:10.960 --> 0:19:16.440
And which methodology were doing so we wrote tests to see how fast it was we found a faster methodology for doing that

256
0:19:16.440 --> 0:19:20.920
And so in that regard we found the fastest way to do count occurrences

257
0:19:20.920 --> 0:19:27.160
And so you as a user should never have to worry about how fast counter currencies is because we've done that testing for you

258
0:19:27.160 --> 0:19:32.320
That's the design of Neos right you shouldn't have to worry about performance if you do it means we should do more work

259
0:19:32.520 --> 0:19:34.520
We should do more work

260
0:19:35.040 --> 0:19:37.040
fuzzy asks about

261
0:19:37.080 --> 0:19:41.160
Okay, so the way that it's done with the Tim. Sorry. I'll state the question

262
0:19:41.160 --> 0:19:46.800
It's not a question, so I kind of just like paraphrase into a question so fuzzy is asking what I previously said about

263
0:19:47.600 --> 0:19:53.680
Audio was only applicable to avatars and not like an in-world microphone, so it's a little bit difficult with like a

264
0:19:53.680 --> 0:19:58.080
a user's voice because the only way to obtain a user's voice right now

265
0:19:58.280 --> 0:20:04.520
Dynamically is to use an avatar equipping event so the tin can telephone what it technically does when you grab it is

266
0:20:05.200 --> 0:20:06.800
you

267
0:20:06.800 --> 0:20:13.500
Temporarily get equipped into another avatar. I have stuff inside the avatar that then like shoulder taps the

268
0:20:14.320 --> 0:20:19.320
Tin can and says here's the audio stream use it and then you get a quick back to your original avatar

269
0:20:19.400 --> 0:20:23.200
So I know you're asking about a clip avatar above that tin can does both of them

270
0:20:23.200 --> 0:20:29.040
Um and then what that does is it lets you gain access to it. That's the only way that you can do it with

271
0:20:30.080 --> 0:20:36.200
Within avatars voice with a user's voice right now. Is that kind of weird equipping route SLS talks about ref hacking

272
0:20:36.200 --> 0:20:39.440
I don't advise ref hacking because it can break at any

273
0:20:40.160 --> 0:20:44.720
Moment so don't advise it it could break tomorrow. It could break yesterday

274
0:20:44.720 --> 0:20:49.280
I don't know could even technically break during a session it just depends like

275
0:20:49.280 --> 0:20:56.000
It's a bit crazy there if you're doing non avatar audio though. There's there's lots that you can do. There's the avatar frame slot

276
0:20:56.520 --> 0:20:59.320
That's why there's like a square and you can put the sound effect in it

277
0:21:00.760 --> 0:21:04.320
There's a bunch of components for doing that and a bunch of

278
0:21:04.600 --> 0:21:09.640
Like stuff there like random audio clip player stuff like that you can redirect that to any audio output throughout the world

279
0:21:10.040 --> 0:21:15.040
There's a bunch of like optimizations that can be done with audio outputs. I do want to talk about on a video at some point

280
0:21:15.040 --> 0:21:20.400
Something which I see for a lot of for example is when people use those frame slots

281
0:21:20.400 --> 0:21:24.520
They forget to remove the audio output on the actual green circle thing

282
0:21:24.720 --> 0:21:29.180
But they redirect the audio from the green circle thing to another output like a speaker

283
0:21:29.200 --> 0:21:33.020
and what that means is you actually doubled your audio output components, which means you've

284
0:21:34.200 --> 0:21:39.360
reduced the available audio outputs that can play concurrently in your world by two instead of one and

285
0:21:39.360 --> 0:21:46.080
You could reduce that back and have an extra audio output component something happens. There are a lot in particle systems

286
0:21:46.080 --> 0:21:48.080
for example, you can have

287
0:21:48.200 --> 0:21:51.800
The same particle system in use by two different emitters

288
0:21:52.040 --> 0:21:57.600
So let's say you're walking through a hall of fire and you've got fire coming out of the wall into you know

289
0:21:57.600 --> 0:22:04.160
Like a sort of Indiana Jones temple star thing. What I'll see is basically each fire on every side of the wall is its own

290
0:22:04.160 --> 0:22:10.200
Particle system and part on a particle emitter. And so there's competing systems that are all firing fire

291
0:22:10.200 --> 0:22:12.200
They're all in the same particle same effect

292
0:22:12.440 --> 0:22:17.120
Instead what you can do is have one particle system and an emitter first side of the wall

293
0:22:17.120 --> 0:22:24.600
And what that lets you do is change everything about the particles from one location and is slightly more efficient slightly

294
0:22:25.480 --> 0:22:27.360
It also means that you can sort of

295
0:22:27.360 --> 0:22:35.560
Globally control the number of particles for that particular fire walk in its entirety and know exactly how many particles exist

296
0:22:35.560 --> 0:22:39.200
For the entire walkway rather than for each flame at the same time

297
0:22:39.200 --> 0:22:43.320
And if you want the flames to be different color, you only have to write it one place. So that's a good tip there. Oh

298
0:22:44.680 --> 0:22:50.360
It's it's great when when people have to continually ask better and better questions to get exactly what they need

299
0:22:50.360 --> 0:22:50.880
I love it

300
0:22:50.880 --> 0:22:57.360
So fuzzy has updated the question again and saying that they would like to pull audio from the world itself including avatar or ambient noise

301
0:22:57.360 --> 0:22:59.360
You're talking more about sort of

302
0:22:59.960 --> 0:23:03.480
Recording what's going on in the world from a from an audio point of view?

303
0:23:04.000 --> 0:23:11.720
That we don't really have anything for and the reason is that like audio coming like out to your ears only goes through one

304
0:23:11.720 --> 0:23:17.920
Thing there. I think there's technically like something in the unity side of things which is the component that does that

305
0:23:17.920 --> 0:23:24.200
It's like the the point in space where you hear the audio coming from. There's only like one of those right now

306
0:23:24.840 --> 0:23:26.400
And that exists in your head

307
0:23:26.400 --> 0:23:32.780
There's a bunch of stuff that like only exists inside the unity side of things and it's completely invisible to you

308
0:23:32.960 --> 0:23:36.820
It might be an audio listener component. I could open up the unity project

309
0:23:36.820 --> 0:23:40.440
It's usually quite scary when I do that. It tries to recompile shaders sometimes which takes two days

310
0:23:40.440 --> 0:23:47.800
I'll find it at some point. But yeah, like it's uh, there's lots of like unity related stuff

311
0:23:47.800 --> 0:23:52.720
That we hope to open up to you at some point. They then be able to mess around with for example

312
0:23:52.720 --> 0:23:58.140
I'm quite interested in we want to do sort of voice calling or in some cases video calling between people in the

313
0:23:58.600 --> 0:24:06.400
In in Neos and to do that we would need like a better system for audio listeners as they're called

314
0:24:06.400 --> 0:24:11.440
So ears in the world, there's lots of ways to make like, you know mouths and speakers and stuff like that

315
0:24:11.440 --> 0:24:16.720
There's only one ear that exists inside your avatar. It's right in the middle head

316
0:24:17.360 --> 0:24:19.360
jumping around

317
0:24:19.680 --> 0:24:25.040
electronicis what's the limit on audio outputs? I never forget. I never forget. I always forget

318
0:24:25.040 --> 0:24:28.540
I always forget that it is something along the lines of 32 to 64

319
0:24:28.760 --> 0:24:32.420
I would always give yourself a little bit of headroom and aim for maybe 28

320
0:24:32.420 --> 0:24:37.340
just because you've got to remember the people in the world are technically an audio source as are

321
0:24:37.980 --> 0:24:40.880
Context menus or bells on their neck, by the way

322
0:24:40.880 --> 0:24:44.580
If you have a bell on your neck that rings when you move around, please adjust it

323
0:24:44.580 --> 0:24:49.340
So it's not on the global audio channel and consider making it not make noise at all. Thank you

324
0:24:50.540 --> 0:24:55.740
Like you're taking up an audio output from the rest of the session to be annoying. Sorry

325
0:24:55.740 --> 0:24:57.420
That's just the way it is

326
0:24:57.420 --> 0:25:04.580
electronicis, but they're the most important more show me your importance through being a good person and through the work that you do inside me

327
0:25:04.580 --> 0:25:06.180
So I don't even mean the stuff that you create

328
0:25:06.180 --> 0:25:10.860
I mean being a community member and then you'll get all my attention, especially if you write talks

329
0:25:11.340 --> 0:25:15.700
Fuzzy ask is there a way to swap left and right audio channels and someone know

330
0:25:16.380 --> 0:25:20.540
You might be able to do that in the user inspector. But again, I wouldn't really advise it

331
0:25:21.060 --> 0:25:24.900
If you do with the developer to create new editor user inspector

332
0:25:24.900 --> 0:25:27.860
There's a bunch of stuff in there and like if you play over the wrong thing

333
0:25:27.860 --> 0:25:32.620
You will crash your game or you will disconnect yourself from the rest of the like just be careful with that stuff

334
0:25:32.700 --> 0:25:37.020
But you might be you might be able to do it in there. Don't negatively scale ahead

335
0:25:37.900 --> 0:25:39.900
Audio has nothing to do with

336
0:25:40.300 --> 0:25:46.100
Like what your head looks like there is something in like how small you get that can affect the audio

337
0:25:46.740 --> 0:25:53.580
That's because the audio engine sort of on a sort of how big things are and tries to sort of mess around audio on that

338
0:25:53.580 --> 0:25:57.380
You'll notice that on an audio output. There's like in the scale max scale

339
0:25:57.380 --> 0:25:59.580
I haven't played with that person because I don't really understand it

340
0:25:59.580 --> 0:26:04.260
But maybe you're making like a borrower's game and you need like bigger things to sound bigger

341
0:26:04.260 --> 0:26:10.060
I don't know. It's there play around with it. Fuzzy says it'll be interesting challenge. Sorry Fuzzy Fox. There's two to two Fuzzy's

342
0:26:10.700 --> 0:26:12.500
says

343
0:26:12.500 --> 0:26:18.740
Fuzzy challenge to play with reversed audio. Um, when you say reversed you mean swapped L and right L R

344
0:26:18.740 --> 0:26:20.740
Sorry

345
0:26:21.820 --> 0:26:26.820
Or do you mean like reversed as in speaking backwards? Oh, they mean to know them. Oh, yeah

346
0:26:28.140 --> 0:26:30.060
Yeah, be interesting. I don't know

347
0:26:30.060 --> 0:26:34.580
Take a look at I'm gonna forget the name of it and probably spend like 20 minutes trying to find it if anyone knows it

348
0:26:34.580 --> 0:26:40.340
In the in the channel, please please please drop it by there is a audio only RPG game on Steam

349
0:26:40.340 --> 0:26:44.020
It won a bunch of awards you play it you play it with your eyes closed

350
0:26:44.020 --> 0:26:47.260
I mean there is text on the screen if you want to but like you don't see your character

351
0:26:47.260 --> 0:26:53.260
You don't see the enemies, but you can like battle people have like full-on boss fights. You don't see anything. It's amazing

352
0:26:54.140 --> 0:26:55.500
moving on to

353
0:26:55.500 --> 0:27:01.140
Additional questions actually just a little anecdote before we get on to the next question here because I see business lawyer in there

354
0:27:01.140 --> 0:27:04.540
There was one time when business lawyers microphone was emitting

355
0:27:05.220 --> 0:27:10.660
Absolutely eldritch cosmic horror noises. I don't remember why I think it's something to do Windows 10

356
0:27:10.940 --> 0:27:13.420
But they joined Aegis wolf and I on

357
0:27:13.420 --> 0:27:16.420
The moon landing world

358
0:27:16.420 --> 0:27:22.300
She's already quite sort of dark and dreary and dim and spooky and they just like because it's also spherical gravity

359
0:27:22.300 --> 0:27:28.740
They kind of like crested over a hill of this spherical gravity world and they were just like speaking just absolute

360
0:27:29.180 --> 0:27:33.660
Horror at us and it was terrifying at a recording of in-game

361
0:27:33.660 --> 0:27:36.620
I will try and get it outside a game so I can post it here

362
0:27:36.620 --> 0:27:43.460
But it was it was terrifying on the audio recording. I have it includes the hitch that would happen before

363
0:27:43.460 --> 0:27:48.540
We had a good garbage collector, which was the long you played Neos the worst the hitch got

364
0:27:49.140 --> 0:27:52.780
And you knew it was happening because all the audio sources would hitch you'd hear like

365
0:27:53.300 --> 0:27:58.640
And they would like get through the hitch and his cosmic horror recording includes some of that

366
0:27:58.640 --> 0:28:03.220
It was terrible especially with the glowing bird eyes of the beak

367
0:28:03.220 --> 0:28:09.580
Just sort of like bouncing up and down of this like oh, it was terrible. Yeah, it was really old like first couple of months

368
0:28:09.580 --> 0:28:13.060
I was scared like I was scared and then once I was scared

369
0:28:13.060 --> 0:28:16.740
It was business lawyer periodically coming back into the world and trying to see if it was fixed or not

370
0:28:17.620 --> 0:28:19.140
moving to

371
0:28:19.140 --> 0:28:21.600
Last questions, I guess because we're running over in time

372
0:28:22.980 --> 0:28:28.180
Girl Griffin asked us an intimate audio source keep a channel busy. Yes, depending on how you use it

373
0:28:28.900 --> 0:28:30.900
There are people here that will disagree

374
0:28:30.900 --> 0:28:33.260
periodically with what I say, but

375
0:28:34.580 --> 0:28:38.100
Use play one shot more lots of people like don't use play one shot these days

376
0:28:38.100 --> 0:28:43.460
I see lots of sort of parented audio outputs or parented green circles, etc

377
0:28:44.060 --> 0:28:48.280
The reason I say use play one shot more is because it creates and then deletes the audio output

378
0:28:48.300 --> 0:28:51.540
It creates then deletes the audio output and people say well it makes a slot

379
0:28:51.540 --> 0:28:55.100
I'm like yeah, but we can optimize that for you like if that's got a problem

380
0:28:55.100 --> 0:29:00.100
We'll optimize it for you like maybe we'll do a play one shot update where it doesn't create a slot

381
0:29:00.100 --> 0:29:04.740
And it'll be more performant if you go out of your way to make systems that we don't understand

382
0:29:04.740 --> 0:29:09.980
We can't optimize them for you later. So I always advise wherever you can play one shot

383
0:29:09.980 --> 0:29:12.060
It's it's just a lot better

384
0:29:12.140 --> 0:29:19.340
It creates the audio output and then removes it if you need to have the audio output around good example here would be repetitive

385
0:29:19.900 --> 0:29:26.920
Noise that needs to occur background music or like ambience stuff like that crickets wind howling stuff like that go for it

386
0:29:26.920 --> 0:29:34.080
But the moment you don't need that sound turn off the audio outputs enabled flag the enabled flag and needs to be off if you're not

387
0:29:34.160 --> 0:29:40.960
Outputting audio through the audio output turn off the enabled property of the audio output that will mean it won't count to your limit

388
0:29:41.240 --> 0:29:43.240
But it can still exist and be there

389
0:29:43.400 --> 0:29:50.240
Footsteps you should question why you need footsteps if it's a game world or you've got atmosphere sure if your avatar individually has footsteps

390
0:29:51.040 --> 0:29:54.420
My headaches do not like that spec says

391
0:29:54.420 --> 0:29:55.860
if

392
0:29:55.860 --> 0:29:57.940
They suggest play one shot

393
0:29:57.940 --> 0:30:01.340
But maybe limit if it's spammable like no more than 380 plays in a time

394
0:30:01.340 --> 0:30:02.900
We did keep audio source counselor

395
0:30:02.900 --> 0:30:03.380
Yeah

396
0:30:03.380 --> 0:30:08.940
Do keep an eye on that one if you spam it then you will create more than you would have found if you had used

397
0:30:08.940 --> 0:30:10.940
a static audio output

398
0:30:11.980 --> 0:30:14.640
Something which I usually do and do advise doing a lot more

399
0:30:15.220 --> 0:30:21.180
Particular things like play one shot and also raycast and stuff like that is make sure that you're filtering the user that the impulse occurs

400
0:30:21.180 --> 0:30:26.220
Into just one user like sometimes, you know, it's just a one user like if it's on a button push or something like that

401
0:30:26.220 --> 0:30:32.460
but if you're not sure there's throw in a equal equal if node and don't fire the impulse because uh

402
0:30:32.740 --> 0:30:34.980
That leads to problems sometimes, you know

403
0:30:34.980 --> 0:30:40.260
You'll you'll have an impulse that you didn't expect to be able to be caused by multiple users

404
0:30:40.420 --> 0:30:47.460
Being caused by multiple users and then at point you'll have n sounds rather than one sound because n is the net of people in

405
0:30:47.460 --> 0:30:48.460
the world

406
0:30:48.460 --> 0:30:51.820
Fuzzy Fox asks is the audio limited because the audio system we're using yes

407
0:30:51.820 --> 0:30:56.260
It's a unity limitation those limitations do exist in a lot of audio engines

408
0:30:56.900 --> 0:30:58.980
It just depends on the ones that we are using

409
0:30:58.980 --> 0:31:05.220
I don't know what it would be or how prevalent it would be but I would I would estimate the the unreal has it

410
0:31:05.220 --> 0:31:11.920
I'd estimate that cry engine has it I would estimate that they all have it. It's just the way that audio works in some regards

411
0:31:12.300 --> 0:31:17.380
I'd like it to not be there but like but probably need a new audio engine for that. I don't know whatever

412
0:31:17.380 --> 0:31:21.900
It's good that it needs to be there though. If you think of like traditional game programming

413
0:31:22.500 --> 0:31:28.060
The audio engineers you'll see that on the credits of our audio engineer. What does that mean? That means both sort of mixing?

414
0:31:28.660 --> 0:31:31.620
Creating the sound stuff like that. That's more audio production though

415
0:31:31.620 --> 0:31:36.860
But that also means like how the audio feels in the game and how it's activated in the game

416
0:31:36.860 --> 0:31:42.540
it's very very complicated and they would keep an eye on how many audio sources they had even if there wasn't a limit because

417
0:31:42.540 --> 0:31:47.340
Audio is resources dresse ask about sound filters. We do have some but they only apply to

418
0:31:48.420 --> 0:31:51.580
Globalized audio right now and they're also sort of like a box, right?

419
0:31:51.580 --> 0:31:54.540
So there are a cube around you that does that effect?

420
0:31:54.540 --> 0:31:59.260
I would like to be able to sort of more limit that to particular sounds etc. It's good for voices

421
0:31:59.260 --> 0:32:03.120
But again, it's only on broadcast audio. So annoying that is an audio engine limitation

422
0:32:04.100 --> 0:32:06.100
Yeah, if you wanna know more about audio

423
0:32:06.100 --> 0:32:13.260
Um speak to ng and if you want to know more about randomized audio stuff speak to fur who does audio for roller coasters

424
0:32:13.260 --> 0:32:15.260
That's a really interesting conversation

425
0:32:15.260 --> 0:32:20.140
Ask them about the Hagrid ride ask them about the Hagrid ride with that. I think we're done

426
0:32:20.140 --> 0:32:22.500
We're running way over on time here

427
0:32:23.340 --> 0:32:25.700
So I will go ahead and leave off here

428
0:32:25.700 --> 0:32:30.020
if you have other questions, feel free to DM me any time and I will get back to you as soon as I can and

429
0:32:30.020 --> 0:32:35.700
And this will be up on sound later today. You'll have a good day. Bye. Bye
