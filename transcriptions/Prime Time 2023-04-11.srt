1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Welcome to Office Hours, it's now 4pm so we're going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,840
 Right on cue, my living room lights just turned on because I got them set to turn on at 4pm.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,920
 And we're going to go ahead and get started by scrolling through the list of questions.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,200
 So Lou Zanth says, "Is there a list of slot names for temporary badges, fruits, account

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
 creation, bread, etc?"

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,080
 There is not, it particularly doesn't help that a lot of those are, what we do is we

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,680
 copy the previous slot when we're generating them so the name gets longer and longer.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,200
 You also shouldn't, like, what's the word, you shouldn't make your system with those

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,600
 slot names as guarantees because they may change at any time.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,680
 Depending on what you want to do with your badges, you have a few options, one is the

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,000
 various aligner components or just doing it numerically, like stepping through each element

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,480
 in the list etc.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,600
 Or you could just make your own icon to-ble-do, you know, whatever sort of scheme you want.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,120
 There's a lot of people doing that recently, they don't show their actual badges, they've

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,160
 got like a custom list of badges.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,760
 Not to call anyone out here, but I believe that Shifty for example, she went down to

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,400
 just the Neos team badge.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,340
 I think she was just done with badges and I perfectly understand that as the person

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,340
 with the most.

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,760
 So yeah, try that out.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,800
 Moving forwards, like, "Is there any updates on the fix for the native build of Neos being

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,140
 unusable?"

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,900
 We are taking a look at that and we'll get to it as soon as we can.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,940
 Grey says, "Is there a way to stop getting office hours pings?"

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,940
 Yes.

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,940
 So, the problem with that one is, it's not the office hours role isn't anything to do

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,940
 with that one.

28
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,860
 The problem is that stages like to add everyone even though they shouldn't.

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,020
 When you start a stage, there's like a button for it, but like I continually forget that

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,140
 that button is there, it's just like notify the server or something like that.

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,180
 I will go ahead and remember to use that setting next time I start a stage.

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,840
 But if you do what the slinker posted, then you'll be able to mute that stage.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,960
 It's actually nothing to do with the office hours role, the office hours role is just

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,820
 when I hang at office hours.

35
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,460
 When I start a stage though, it's like at everyone pretty much.

36
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,380
 Moving forwards to the next question here.

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,220
 Fuzzy says, "Can you speak faster by watching your YouTube videos at 1.5 speed?"

38
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,740
 No, you sound oddly slow.

39
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,740
 Interesting.

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,820
 I've always said to people, you can slow my videos down and I know a lot of people do

41
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,100
 do that because apparently I'm too fast.

42
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,700
 As I've said a few times before, I'm running at probably like 50% speed during a recording

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,220
 of a tutorial because I need to explain things.

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,260
 Whereas when I'm building, I can sort of barely explain anything.

45
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,300
 Someone will watch me build and be like, "What are you doing now?"

46
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,740
 And I'll just be like, "I don't know.

47
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,820
 I don't know.

48
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,980
 Just let me do it, please."

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,940
 Ray asks, "Are we required to have internal organs to use NeoSwati?

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,120
 We have external organs."

51
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,080
 The state of your organs is not a topic that is covered by the Neos usage guidelines.

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,300
 If it would be, there would be an update to the Neos usage guidelines.

53
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,700
 I don't think your organs have anything to do with that.

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,740
 Next question is, "Linka asks, "Any comment on the active sessions bot being down?

55
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,820
 It kind of died when the SSL cert on the old API."

56
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,340
 So I assume it's polling the old API in an ever-ending loop, most likely no idea who

57
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,780
 hosts it.

58
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,460
 That one I had not realized.

59
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,700
 I will raise that with the team when I can.

60
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,940
 Let me just make a note of that one.

61
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,260
 And with that, we are currently out of questions.

62
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,660
 If you would go ahead and come up with more questions.

63
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,060
 Or don't, it's completely up to you.

64
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,980
 Ray asks, "Does the drive node constantly update whenever it's driving, or only when

65
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,100
 the input value updates?"

66
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:46,100
 That is -- do you mean the drive drive node, the one that's in actions?

67
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,380
 Or do you mean just the arrow, like a regular drive?

68
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,140
 Okay, you mean the drive drive node.

69
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,860
 So the drive drive node is effectively equivalent to the drive arrow, for those who are unaware.

70
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,740
 If you see an arrow that's sort of got rounded corners in logic, that's a drive.

71
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,660
 If you see a pointy sharp arrow, which is more transparent in the center of it, that's

72
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,660
 a reference arrow.

73
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,340
 So there's a good sort of rule of thumb to identify the difference.

74
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,740
 If it's rounded, it's a drive.

75
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:19,020
 But the drive drive node basically sets up one of those drive arrows, but programmatically

76
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,420
 allowing you to sort of start and stop it with that node.

77
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:28,540
 So it functions identically to an actual drive, it just has more controls, and you can start

78
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,740
 and stop that drive.

79
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,860
 So therefore it has the same rules as a regular drive.

80
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:40,900
 And the regular drive is based on a sort of notification system that sort of floods through

81
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,400
 the wires a little bit, like electricity would.

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,120
 So if we think about the simplest logic circuit that you can think of, which is adding two

83
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,860
 numbers together and then driving the result of how big a sphere is with the result.

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,060
 Let's say you put 1+1, you add it together, you get 2, and then you drive the size of

85
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,260
 the sphere with that.

86
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,420
 At that state, nothing is changing, nothing is updating, because the value of 1+1 equaling

87
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,020
 2 is constant, and Neos knows that.

88
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,940
 If you then edit one of those input nodes to maybe change that 1 to a 2 or whatever

89
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,900
 number it is, you cause an update, both on the network to sort of say to anyone else

90
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,660
 in the session, "hey, this value is now 3" or whatever you put in, but also in terms

91
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,820
 of logic where it will re-evaluate that chain.

92
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,700
 It will flow out of the input node into the plus node and tell the plus node "yo man,

93
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,460
 update your value" and then the plus node goes "got it bro, updating my value" and

94
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,700
 then it passes that on to the drive system.

95
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
 So that's how it works.

96
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,900
 There are of course exceptions, things like updating relay which will force stuff to continually

97
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:53,180
 evaluate and various nodes which just by their nature force stuff to continually evaluate.

98
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,860
 So it does depend.

99
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,580
 The goal is basically to not do mathematics twice, we don't need to.

100
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,260
 1+1 is always 2.

101
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,140
 Although I did watch a long time ago, someone linked me this video of this, it was either

102
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:12,260
 a retired military person or it was like a retired teacher, professor, scientist or something

103
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,060
 like that, and they were just rambling in front of a whiteboard about how they'd invented

104
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,260
 a new form of power based on the principle that 1+1 equaled 1 and it went on forever

105
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,980
 and it was like a fever dream, it was amazing.

106
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,820
 They were talking about the east and west magnetic poles as well and it was just like

107
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,820
 "what?"

108
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,260
 It was very confusing, but there we go.

109
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,260
 The CloutPanda says "how's my week been?

110
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,980
 Also we had a comment on hope you have a headache-free day from Jackal at the start of office hours"

111
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,980
 yeah, pretty good day.

112
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,940
 I'm probably going to TMI for a moment here.

113
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,460
 I was cleaning my bathroom yesterday right, and I needed to replace the toilet seat because

114
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,340
 it's old and it was cracking and I wanted to replace it, so I bought what I thought

115
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,580
 was an identical toilet seat.

116
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,660
 It turns out it was the wrong size.

117
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,260
 So just imagine me holding this new toilet seat triumphantly over my toilet, trying to

118
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,380
 affix it, screwing it all down, looking at it and being like "that looks stupid" because

119
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,740
 it was the wrong shape, and then having to unscrew it gently with much aggression, throw

120
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,980
 place gently the new toilet seat to the side and then re-affix the old one, grumpily.

121
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,480
 Well it was gently, because if I throw it I'd probably damage a wall and it's a rental,

122
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,860
 so it was as aggressive as gentle can be to not damage anything.

123
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,420
 I do wish I owned my own place outright, because then I could do what my dad does when stuff

124
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,460
 annoys him, he just says "that's going up the garden" and he means it.

125
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,680
 So there was this one time where there was a party, and he was using a blender to make

126
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,180
 a sauce or something, I don't remember, but the blender just stopped working, and

127
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:56,180
 he just opened the back door and just yeeted it into the garden, because that's where it

128
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,900
 belonged apparently.

129
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:06,300
 Moving forwards to Fuzzy's question, which says "been having trouble" exactly like that

130
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
 gif, that's from the office isn't it?

131
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
 I don't know.

132
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,780
 Fuzzy's question "been having trouble working out the various inn, user inn headset,

133
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,740
 etc. knows this, they don't appear to work agree with each other, trying to take AFK

134
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,260
 type situations, things seem inconsistent" You need an updating relay for those, and

135
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,180
 then you should be able to work out the difference, just make sure you've got an updating relay

136
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,180
 for those.

137
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,460
 I think Is User Present is like an "and" between the other ones.

138
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,500
 I can open up Is User Present now, just go to the tab to the correct Visual Studio project,

139
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,260
 seeing as I have 1, 2, 3, 4 open today, I don't know why.

140
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,340
 Is User Present.

141
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:53,740
 Is User Present will swap itself with Is User Present in World when it loads.

142
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,700
 Is User Present is not a node that we have, it will just swap around.

143
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,060
 Looks like we didn't remove it from the list, which is weird.

144
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,800
 No no no no no, hold on, hold on, I read that wrong.

145
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,300
 One moment here.

146
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:14,340
 If your Is User Present node existed before a certain date, when you load it will be swapped

147
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,300
 with Is User Present in World.

148
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,180
 After that fact, it will still work as Is Present.

149
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,100
 Is Present.

150
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:35,420
 Is Present is present in headset, or not VR active and is present in world.

151
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,860
 So are they in the headset and are they in the session?

152
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,420
 Is Present inside the world, are they in this world?

153
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,880
 No man, they're totally out of this world.

154
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,060
 Is Present in headset, is their headset working?

155
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,020
 Sorry, is their headset on?

156
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:02,580
 Yeah, our version management systems are fantastic.

157
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,940
 I've been trying to encourage us to do as a team, is to when we do that stuff, leave

158
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,060
 a comment saying why.

159
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:16,500
 There's a lot in programming and opinions about how useful comments are, etc.

160
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,580
 Some people say that the code should explain the why, and I'm just like nope.

161
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,620
 Code sometimes cannot explain why.

162
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,040
 So comments are needed to explain why.

163
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,140
 And then code purists will come after me and they'll say "oh but if you update the code

164
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,320
 then the comments are out of date" and I say well then your pull request or your code

165
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,220
 review process should include an item saying "I have updated comments around this area

166
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,820
 to make it make sense" and if it doesn't then that's a bad engineer.

167
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,160
 You know, it should just be no excuse for it.

168
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:54,140
 So if it's unclear why, or you think "hey 3am prime won't understand what I was doing

169
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,020
 here later" then I add a comment.

170
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,160
 There are actually some times where I add a comment with a link to the Stack Overflow

171
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,960
 question where I got the stuff from.

172
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,740
 That's good because it provides credit.

173
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,440
 But it's also good because I go back to it and I'm like "what is this eldritch chicken

174
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
 scratch here?

175
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,320
 Why have you done it this way?"

176
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,260
 And the answer is "because you spent 3 hours and here was the answer you found on Stack

177
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,660
 Overflow after 3 hours" so I've even said "hey we can even reference issues, for example

178
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,440
 if something weird happened we can just put a comment saying 'this is why we did it'

179
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,140
 and then we can literally reference the github issue because it'll be there as long as github

180
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,680
 is up" which I don't imagine it going down any time soon.

181
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,560
 That's that question, I want to scroll through and make sure we got... okay that's that done.

182
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,940
 I think we're out of questions now.

183
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,800
 Fuzzy is asking a cloud variable question which is why I'm giggling because cloud variables

184
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,980
 are... cloud variables are unfinished which is why they're so confusing.

185
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,240
 I'm so sorry that cloud variables are so confusing.

186
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,560
 I have to consult the oracle.

187
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
 Give me a second.

188
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,640
 By the oracle I mean my documentation on the wiki which is sometimes wrong.

189
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,000
 It was wrong, I updated a bunch of it but like it's always wrong.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,960
 You're asking about definition only... definition owner only unsafe.

191
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,300
 Okay definition own own... do you... can't even say it.

192
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,820
 Definition owner... no.

193
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,560
 Definition owner only unsafe can be used by users and groups.

194
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:38,600
 Definition owner only unsafe is only used for a singular value and it's in read write

195
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,840
 permissions though so it's useful for version control systems.

196
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:51,760
 I don't know if you uclops here but like definition owner only unsafe would be what I might use

197
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,200
 if the wiki is correct which it might not be for the version detection system which

198
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,320
 redprint has for example.

199
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,020
 I would probably use definition owner only there which means I could set the version

200
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:09,840
 number inside the dash because I didn't want someone doing some hacky logics to do it in

201
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,640
 an unsafe way with like "you guys there's a new version of redprint and it's called

202
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:23,360
 version 17400 and cheese" which could theoretically happen if you use definition owner only unsafe

203
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,680
 because it can be set in an unsafe context.

204
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,520
 You set that for a read permission on a variable and it's still readable in world using a user

205
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,880
 from username node unless read by... you set it for...

206
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,120
 I'd have to look at like the setup and the configuration and which logics nodes you're

207
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,120
 doing so if you can share that we can look at it more.

208
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,080
 Great like it's not like there is no node by that name.

209
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,640
 Can we like yeah can we can we just you know tone that down I'm looking at the full node

210
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
 list here.

211
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,800
 Yep I know that name.

212
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,440
 Oh confusing the stage also has a chat channel oh my god we should probably like switch to

213
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
 that at some point yeah.

214
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,520
 Anyway moving on to questions.

215
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,940
 Fuzzy wants a variable only they could okay so if you want it only that you can read it

216
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,280
 definition owner only without the unsafe would be the way that you do it because with the

217
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,280
 unsafe it means that people can read it if you're in the session and they know their

218
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,800
 way around logics.

219
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,680
 The oo node is a joke node you're not meant to use it for anything concrete it's just

220
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:43,000
 outputs what's this much like the b0 3 all node which is just a typo that for example

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,800
 funny so put it into the code.

222
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,600
 I was actually thinking about this the other day and hey this is this is my space to talk

223
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:56,440
 about random stuff including toilet seats so Microsoft has a policy where we don't do

224
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,080
 April Fools jokes and because of my time at that company I agree I completely agree that

225
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:11,520
 companies should not do April Fools jokes and what happened is that order or like directive

226
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,360
 or I guess policy but the right word since we're not talking about military came directly

227
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:23,180
 from like the chief legal officer of Microsoft and the reason behind that is like they calculated

228
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:29,720
 the like cost in terms of sort of marketing legal financial etc about putting out something

229
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,680
 that was confusing and it was large like say for example you put out like you know today

230
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:43,480
 Microsoft is releasing Microsoft cheese because it's April Fools or Microsoft Pi 3.1.4 etc

231
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,080
 some person somewhere is going to be confused by that and they're going to have some action

232
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:57,080
 that may lead to a decline in reputation revenue legal standing stock price whatever so they

233
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,080
 were just like nope we don't do it anymore and I just completely agree with that so I

234
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,000
 want more companies to sort of do that measurement if they're like really small it's probably

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,320
 not going to matter but like when it comes to like a gigantic company like Microsoft

236
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,840
 it just like makes sense.

237
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,240
 Zari says it always backfires it's not like it always backfires it's like the potential

238
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,120
 for backfiring is higher than the reward right if you want to be funny be funny 365 days

239
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,360
 a year you can see that with the social media accounts for brands where they're trying to

240
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,360
 be funny sometimes they aren't funny sometimes they are but they are consistently trying

241
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,600
 if the brand is only quote funny on April 1st then it's just it's really weird like

242
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,080
 I kind of like for example I like Discord's brand Discord's brand is it feels quite young

243
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,680
 it doesn't feel stuffy it doesn't feel you know too corporate like and that's because

244
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,600
 they work on that brand every single time they do an announcement every single time

245
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,080
 they do a release there's a frog on my head for example.

246
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,040
 I don't answer cheese questions here yes questions or questions about toilet seats those are

247
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,280
 mine today all right I don't see any other questions although fuzzy does say sorry for

248
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,000
 all the dumb questions there is no such thing as a dumb question if you don't understand

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,520
 something you have two choices in the world and that is to try and understand it or to

250
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,240
 give up and trying to understand it is always the best option so please ask questions there

251
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,500
 are like dumbly worded questions I guess would be the sort of term to use it you can read

252
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,760
 all of that that at a page called asking good questions you could just Google I can't remember

253
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,420
 the exact one I was looking for but yeah just how to ask good questions that's also the

254
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,260
 XY problem etc let's take a look I have questions Tiki says to save something like a personal

255
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,880
 playlist what kind of storage should I use playlist of videos I wouldn't recommend cloud

256
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,260
 variables for that because lists are of course difficult you could comma separate value or

257
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,120
 tab separated value or whatever the hell you want separated value a list of videos into

258
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,880
 a cloud variable definition owner again is the sort of variant of permissions that you

259
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,740
 need as as fuzzy as struggling with those you'll probably have to do some experimentation

260
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,500
 but I wouldn't recommend cloud variables for a personal playlist when it comes to music

261
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,860
 and playlists I actually recommend especially if it's a YouTube playlist make a YouTube

262
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,180
 playlist and then you can like put that YouTube playlist into some of the players we have

263
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,460
 in game and it will play that playlist and in some cases and I apologize for bringing

264
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,100
 this up in some cases consider whether you need to play your music to everyone else in

265
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,140
 the world gray says just check I think the user mesh hide component is broken yeah I

266
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,840
 don't know what that one is either like this is another sort of like we need we need comments

267
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:53,260
 and it's like avatar user mesh hider what do you think it does because I've just read

268
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,940
 what it does and to answer your question I need to know what you think it does I've just

269
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,420
 been through the entire node list gray like there's not a node by that name like I did

270
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,480
 control T typed in that and then I scroll through the entire list and I need to scroll

271
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,420
 down I'm sorry I don't realize I was gonna scroll down apologies for that I'll take a

272
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,940
 look now sometimes I just forget a scroll bar exists I blame it being like almost the

273
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,080
 same color as the background angry pilot says is it technically possible for users in the

274
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,800
 US to load a resource pics videos etc from other user host if it's only available on

275
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:33,440
 a local server for that host I don't know what you're asking let me read it again is

276
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,240
 it any possible for users in news to load a resource from other users or the host if

277
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,440
 it's only available on a local server for that host no the load would have to be triggered

278
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,080
 by the person who owns it a good example for that would be let's say you have the latest

279
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,000
 funny meme tik tok video on your hard drive you would have to import it for people to

280
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,880
 be able to see it okay so catching up on the composition but use a mesh hider yeah it's

281
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:07,160
 for like hair and stuff like that it should work I'm reading the code for it now basically

282
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:15,520
 on equip it says yeah whoever's wearing the avatar we go through all the mesh renderers

283
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,240
 are the ones that aren't on the exclude list it will just hide which which sounds backwards

284
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:30,160
 I feel it should be like an include not an exclude list like hide the hair hide the hat

285
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,120
 linker says that it does work people just think it hides the other yeah yeah people

286
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,920
 I remember also thinking that the avatar mesh avatar user mesh hider was also some sort

287
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,280
 of like safety feature right it sounds like user blocking it is not all of that will be

288
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,840
 fixed by you know documentation it also be fixed in some cases by just having those features

289
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,880
 generically yeah it just like it does a value user override for the for the hair etc it

290
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:06,960
 will include mirrors it will include cameras anything rendered from the point of view of

291
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,200
 the user who has it equipped camera avatar mirror whatever will have the effect like

292
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
 if you wanted to do it if I don't know a photo shoot let's say you're dancing or whatever

293
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,600
 you would have to get a camera person that didn't do that yeah it probably I mean I don't

294
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,720
 know there's no comments in the code base around why it was added but it probably existed

295
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,440
 before we had the net the near clip adjustments and it was probably something for excited

296
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,840
 to give people additional options that weren't hey just do it do it vrchat does guys just

297
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,400
 just do it just do what vrchat does which is where they like shrink your head to zero

298
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,880
 from your head camera only right let's move forwards fuzzy says had some witness today

299
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,440
 running headless or custom URL one person couldn't join through a button facet I made

300
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,920
 although it's been working for weeks and work for me after giving them a regular invite

301
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,840
 they were able to join the world and come back again using the facet not really a question

302
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,160
 but moreover that was an odd moment if I was gonna manage try to report it yeah depending

303
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:13,400
 on like the invite settings and the privacy settings even if you have a custom URL you

304
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,800
 sometimes can't join it without an invite like the fact that you gave them an invite

305
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,400
 and then the facet works makes me think it was like a permission II thing like if you

306
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,240
 did like I don't know I'd have to I'd have to do an entire test matrix on it and I haven't

307
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,760
 done that but like you could totally do that and figure out what the options are there

308
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,600
 switch this is just out of curiosity any info what the universe ID is for what does for

309
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,720
 I don't know if it works I don't think anyone's used it but universe ID is to segregate parts

310
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,160
 of the Neos community this sounds so like the touristic is to segregate parts of the

311
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,560
 Neos community into separate universes you can think of it a little bit like subreddits

312
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,320
 so there's an example here a school my enter universe ID of hopefully something that isn't

313
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,240
 just the name of the school but they're an entire universe ID and all the computers that

314
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,440
 run Neos and then they wouldn't be able to see us us fairies hanging out in the corner

315
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,200
 you know making fairy noises because they're a school they'll be on the school universe

316
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,380
 I've not seen anyone use it successfully I've had many occurrence where we should be using

317
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,120
 it but it's just not being used I don't know if that's because it doesn't work or because

318
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,240
 people aren't aware of it but there we go as an example the user Peck is a professor

319
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,160
 at the University of somewhere in Prague sometimes his students come in and they flood the active

320
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,360
 session list with a bunch of sort of new users who are also your students and so that's always

321
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,320
 fun to see that should probably be on its own universe like says what you think of this

322
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,720
 show 256 it's impressive I hope you had fun I won't be reading it further because it makes

323
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,880
 my head spin I am impressed that you got it done though picture says Aggie parts question

324
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,860
 was more related to network and powers if it was linked to local server on another user

325
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,880
 could it be opened on another user through the hose sort of similar to relaying RPCs

326
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,100
 from loading no that can't be done the avatar use a mesh

327
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:13,840
 is broken there's a difference between broken and not designed well it's working I guarantee

328
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,240
 that reading the code it's really really simple guarantee it works it's just not designed

329
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,940
 for the way that you want to use it so the avatar user mesh is broken it's just not designed

330
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,000
 the way that you want to use it there's a there's a difference there that's also why

331
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,520
 we have the bug issue type on GitHub and the tweak issue type on GitHub like that isn't

332
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,740
 a bug that's it that's a tweak you are requesting additional functionality to be added to the

333
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:43,400
 component thank you parlor elaborates and talks about them having a local FTP server

334
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,740
 and asking if news users could go through that and talk to them no that would be would

335
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,040
 have to bring would have to bring the external news user into your network which just doesn't

336
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,480
 exist could we ferry packets somehow there's probably some sort of protocol where we can

337
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,560
 sort of proxy or something yes so like ultimately that's possible but no you can't right now

338
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:10,440
 gray asks so you can make an adult universe maybe gray needs a cold shower theoretically

339
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,680
 yes but you'd have to abide by all nearest usage guidelines even on that universe so

340
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,500
 nothing in public sessions etc etc go read the guidelines there would be not much reason

341
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,040
 to do it is what I'm saying because you would still be breaking the guidelines if anything

342
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:35,200
 was public in the future perhaps eventually not now not now you might be able to do and

343
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,120
 have public adult sessions Yuki asks so question though would would wouldn't even with separate

344
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,640
 university you'd have access to both essential photos I think you would yeah I don't know

345
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,440
 how much the universe system has been implemented I just haven't had a chance to try it zinc

346
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,920
 has followed up with some information that says you can send it to anything really and

347
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,880
 then only works the world browser and you can still join in contacts it's literally

348
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,600
 hidden but allowed in contacts page it does nothing to folders see it's purely session

349
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,720
 listing gray is still claiming it's broken yeah it only does it when you equip it so

350
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,320
 you need to once you've set it up you need to re-equip the avatar Lex is seeing how to

351
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,320
 break the guidelines if someone else uses your universe ID then the universe sessions

352
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,860
 would show up publicly in the session browser of that content so it would still be public

353
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,840
 because it's still viewable to the public and yeah you might make a universe ID like

354
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:36,120
 a random alphanumeric string that is like very long but someone could still guess it

355
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,700
 gray says please don't put whatever my sorry it wasn't intention I will go ahead and make

356
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,920
 a tutorial on it for you and that way we'll see if it works Yuki says a school setting

357
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,180
 universe ID isn't enough they would have to delete those fault yeah I'm trying to sort

358
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,460
 of figure out and have a conversation with the team about what we do about near essentials

359
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,440
 and central tools I want to combine them together essential tools should just be near essentials

360
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:10,000
 tools and I also want to sort of come up with a way where we don't have as many orange folders

361
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,200
 inside news essentials as we do like I don't I don't like how there are team folders in

362
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,880
 multiple locations like I would love if it was just like in those actually a folder for

363
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,040
 a community folders and then inside the community folders we put all the team folders in there

364
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,360
 because then it would be it just like it's clear that you're entering an area that is

365
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,440
 not near essentials because right now they're just everywhere I also think as a team we

366
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,740
 need to come up with a policy of what goes in near essentials and what doesn't because

367
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,200
 it's very clear that some team members put useful items in there whilst those items are

368
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,400
 useful it's sort of like do we have a policy and what should be included and what shouldn't

369
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,200
 be included I don't so we need one those sorts of things are things that you only think about

370
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,980
 when you start getting into like a larger company when you're like oh you know it's

371
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,440
 beyond sort of like a few hundred people playing now it's a few thousand people playing now

372
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,240
 it's ten thousand people playing and you're like okay we need to make sure nothing goes

373
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,960
 wrong we also need a policy for what gets featured how stuff gets featured etc word

374
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,760
 policy might sound scary to some people but it's basically just like let's discuss it

375
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,200
 and then record that we've discussed it so that we're not confused later tiki says it

376
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,420
 often happens in desktop mode the world goes fully white on a session switching session

377
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,480
 everything's okay coming back it's still white until I respawn and ideas how this happens

378
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,160
 I had that for months literally months and then it just randomly stops so I never looked

379
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,000
 into it I apologize I don't have much more information on that one that literally happened

380
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,360
 for months and I've only really just now remind remembered it I could look the flashbang right

381
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,760
 sometimes it would happen and used to go like what's up and I like I don't mind me the flashbangs

382
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,780
 got off I'm gonna respond sorry says the new shield has always struck me as not being well

383
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,080
 placed in the official news folder yeah I don't like the new shield I don't think it

384
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,120
 should be there now to be clear because I know we have this issue and then in this community

385
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,400
 that doesn't mean I dislike the owner or the author it just means I don't personally like

386
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,680
 that particular item and I don't think it should be exactly writers jackal says very

387
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,760
 good point about nice essentials I mean there's interesting stuff in news essentials but as

388
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,700
 a relative newbie a lot of things have for me meaningless names because they are named

389
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,440
 for the people who built them and such and such so-and-so is creative stuff yeah there's

390
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,760
 also a problem where some of the items are named like you'd name a book or a film not

391
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,080
 how you'd name a tool like for example a screwdriver is called a screwdriver because it drives

392
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:46,080
 screws but in neo sland a screwdriver might be called like primes super fantastic ultimate

393
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:54,920
 RGB tag special ultimate RGB tag version 17 thing and you're like yeah I have no idea

394
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,880
 what that does and then you spawn it and there's no instructions it's just like a tool you

395
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,320
 hook up but you don't know what it does some people do have like ways around that the basic

396
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,720
 is one I say movies where a gearball will like parent a piece of text to the object

397
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,100
 which is set to non persistent when it loads so it's sort of like spawns in the text but

398
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,500
 won't hang around and it says like equip this and push left trigger to fly or whatever if

399
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,480
 you look inside the examples folder inside news essentials that's kind of sort of my

400
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,360
 playing ground is a little bit more organized there and sort of functional units although

401
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,160
 of course there's always more work to do on that line gray says why don't you like the

402
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,240
 shield the shield teaches the wrong solution to a problem so the solution to the problem

403
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,060
 is to combat the culture that you're experiencing which requires you to have the shield now

404
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,440
 of course you'll say yeah but so many new people come in and then they get our hands

405
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,680
 on stuff the you know do does stuff that the shield protects against which like okay can

406
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,440
 a people stop making that stuff be can we stop handing out to new users see can we start

407
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,600
 educating new users on our rules and guidelines and then like D E F and G and H is like please

408
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,840
 report people who are consistently harassing you to moderation they need to know it's bad

409
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,560
 we are running over time here but I'll give you a quick example of the story I was in

410
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,360
 a world there was some unoccupied avatars in the corner a brand new user who was young

411
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,620
 but old enough to play the game so 13 or above came into the session and started verbally

412
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,720
 abusing an unoccupied avatar in the corner now of course this unoccupied avatar was unoccupied

413
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,000
 so they weren't verbally abusing some actual person but I went over and I told them off

414
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,600
 and I said hey this behavior isn't appropriate on this platform we don't insult each other

415
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,240
 we you know we have fun we hang out and they didn't really get the message for a little

416
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,680
 bit but a bit later they did get the message and they actually went back over to this under

417
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,080
 completed avatar and apologized to it and I thought that was kind of sweet I have never

418
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,400
 seen that user ever again I presume they went on to go play gorilla tag or something but

419
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,920
 it was just like a perfect example of I taught them the culture that I wish that the entirety

420
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,440
 of Neos had which is we see an issue we talk to them about the issue until they understand

421
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,680
 it and if they don't understand it we continue to talk to them about the consequences of

422
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,880
 them not understanding that issue which is the consequences are you will be kicked like

423
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,960
 here are the consequences of your action Lexus how do we currently change the culture without

424
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,840
 changes to soften it Neos essentials and updates of the platform to make it easier one way

425
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,280
 would be to I guess a few ways would be first of all recognized as a session host you do

426
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,520
 actually unfortunately have to go into teacher mode sometimes and do what I was just describing

427
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,080
 which is you explain to someone why their behavior is inappropriate you talk about the

428
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,680
 consequences for if they continue the behavior and then you you you kick them I've seen a

429
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,800
 lot of users who sort of come forward or talk about it where they are the session host but

430
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,760
 they feel bad about maybe kicking or banning people because they don't want to cause strife

431
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,760
 or upset etc that's the sort of thing that we need to change like it also happens in

432
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,760
 in the real world there's whole sort of I think it's called like bystander training

433
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,240
 or something there's a whole name for it like green green dot or something I can't remember

434
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,880
 what it is it's basically like if and this is a horrible topic but let's say I don't

435
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:20,500
 know you're on a subway train and you see I don't know let's say someone being harassed

436
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,240
 in the corner like are you going to intervene with that and if you are going to intervene

437
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,040
 do you know how to intervene appropriately would other people on the train back you up

438
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,180
 not in a way where they're going to throw fists or anything but like would they back

439
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,440
 you up in the ways of sort of correctly de-escalating the situation and you know getting the person

440
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,080
 to safety etc would they and the answer is probably no and bystander training is the

441
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,720
 idea of trying to improve that situation there are a couple of updates that can be made to

442
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,300
 worlds to help things as well if you go into the permission system you can set the max

443
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,680
 scale and min scale they're currently set to a little bit of a weird number if you just

444
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:06,320
 raise those up and down a little bit that will help you can also set the full respawn

445
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,160
 position to a little bit higher that will also help because that means that when people

446
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,720
 do fall off terrain they won't spend forever falling they'll just fall for a little bit

447
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,520
 and then immediately respawn so it minimizes them for time where they're disturbed there's

448
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,880
 probably like other stuff you can do in the character controller to like limit the velocity

449
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:30,800
 of people like globally I know that you'll be able to do it with the the locomotion modifiers

450
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,480
 that I've seen that I did that big world on it is a difficult problem and like it's it's

451
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,600
 not like I'm asking you guys to solve it and we won't like trust me like I want to solve

452
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
 it I want to like provide as many tools as possible to solve it it's just we are currently

453
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,400
 stuck in that situation where we can't there's a particular variant of the bystander training

454
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,040
 I just can't like it's something like green green light green dot it was all sort of like

455
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,720
 trying to sort of like change the mindset from sort of like that isn't happening I should

456
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,240
 ignore it into I am an active participant in this event and it's on me to try and do

457
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,340
 something or something like that green dot find standard intervention training that's

458
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,020
 the one yeah there we go Specs has an amazing statement which I'll read we are leaving off

459
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,920
 so please drop down the level of questions I'm trying to wrap things up here now but

460
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,520
 Specs says confrontation can be scary most time people will listen I've had people quite

461
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,080
 firmly hey please don't keep sporting noise color vomit 5000 or I'll have to kick you

462
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,920
 and they stop doing it do you remember when it turns when it comes to loading stuff as

463
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,240
 as grace's collide initialization route it was literally the first tutorial I did please

464
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,200
 go watch it you'll learn a lot about like paroms first tutorial and it tells you how

465
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,420
 to fix up your collisions so that you don't fall through the ground on load whilst I'm

466
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,360
 here because I came up in conversation at some point as well consider not spawning the

467
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:58,080
 hermit meter by the way the hermit meter for those who are not aware is a meter which gets

468
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,880
 the percentage of people in private worlds and it's an unhealthy metric that I don't

469
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,380
 think you should do what it does is it points a massive big finger at those people hiding

470
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:14,180
 in private worlds and says haha you're a problem and that isn't a healthy way to get them out

471
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,400
 of private sessions like if you want to get people out of private sessions you need to

472
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,560
 give them a reason to come out of private sessions and if the first thing they see when

473
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,680
 they come out of private sessions is people discussing people in private sessions it doesn't

474
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,840
 encourage them like it's basically just going like these people are a problem and when they

475
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,120
 come out of private sessions we're going to talk about them even though they've they've

476
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,300
 braved a public session it's it's just like it's it's the wrong way to do it like give

477
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,200
 them a reason encourage them and invite them very good specs you've won the sort of analogy

478
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,120
 award for today specs is if you've ever been told by parents or family oh so you've come

479
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,880
 out of your cave as an introvert you know how much that sucks good good good analogy

480
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,160
 uh yeah i'll speak to major about i didn't realize it was in the creator jam uh template

481
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,960
 like if you want a hermit meter flip it upside down have the non-hermit meter and then try

482
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,640
 and increase that it but like the number of people in public sessions right now the social

483
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,720
 meter the potential friends meter i'll go ahead and leave off there if you have any

484
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,080
 additional questions please feel free to dm me tag me send me pigeons whatever you want

485
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,000
 to do i will go ahead and answer them to the best of my ability i am starving i'm gonna
