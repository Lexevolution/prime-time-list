1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.880
All right, so I make it the top of the hour that means prime time the AMA office hours are for me

2
0:00:04.880 --> 0:00:08.320
It's starting if you have questions drop them in the office hours text channel

3
0:00:08.320 --> 0:00:12.120
That's like two channels up from the one that you're currently looking at if you're in the meeting stage

4
0:00:12.360 --> 0:00:17.680
Let's go ahead and get started do have a few preamble bits. So we're experimenting today with new technology

5
0:00:18.040 --> 0:00:23.720
I set up prime time as a podcast on the sounder FM system

6
0:00:24.200 --> 0:00:27.200
Which means we update upload an audio file to them

7
0:00:27.200 --> 0:00:31.440
They do automatic audio transcription and storage for us at varying qualities

8
0:00:31.440 --> 0:00:37.640
And then you guys can listen to that online at any point with the audio transcription sort of like following along in between

9
0:00:37.920 --> 0:00:41.960
On there so they get you sort of like recordings and audio transcription

10
0:00:41.960 --> 0:00:46.440
That means that prime shouldn't really have to write notes anymore. I'm not really sure about the quality of that

11
0:00:46.440 --> 0:00:49.540
I did some test recordings, but it's kind of difficult before you do like a full run-through

12
0:00:49.880 --> 0:00:53.400
So if it's crap, I'll write regular notes and we'll sort something else out

13
0:00:53.400 --> 0:00:58.440
But it should help those who want to listen and read along and do both at the same time as far as more

14
0:00:58.960 --> 0:01:00.960
So that's cool

15
0:01:00.960 --> 0:01:06.160
Secondarily, I keep getting asked like what do you want people to do? You know more what do you want the community to do more?

16
0:01:06.160 --> 0:01:11.540
I got a bit ranty. So I just like ranted into a document that's on the wiki here. It's under my

17
0:01:12.120 --> 0:01:13.920
user page, so

18
0:01:13.920 --> 0:01:16.520
It's like my space I can rent if you don't agree with it

19
0:01:16.520 --> 0:01:17.240
That's totally fine

20
0:01:17.240 --> 0:01:22.460
But it's just a page could be considerate where I talk about all the things that people do that I wish you guys didn't do

21
0:01:22.460 --> 0:01:30.080
Um, there's discussion about sort of why how what when where in there if you disagree with literally any of that, it's fine

22
0:01:30.080 --> 0:01:35.140
I'm not gonna hate you about it. It's just a list of stuff. I wish people didn't do or did do

23
0:01:36.500 --> 0:01:39.340
There is lots of stuff there that causes frequent arguments

24
0:01:39.340 --> 0:01:44.460
But do you remember that none of it is an attack on you is instead just sort of a request like hey

25
0:01:44.740 --> 0:01:48.500
maybe don't shoot me in the face of your giant weapon every time you see me or

26
0:01:48.500 --> 0:01:50.500
Or

27
0:01:50.740 --> 0:01:56.720
Hey, maybe don't put a bell on your neck which rings from across the map I can hear literally everywhere

28
0:01:59.500 --> 0:02:02.100
Hey, maybe don't make the entire halo

29
0:02:03.140 --> 0:02:10.500
Orchestral and choral theme tune play when you open your context menu on global audio at global volume. Thank you. Oh

30
0:02:10.500 --> 0:02:18.820
Oh, yeah, maybe bake your blend shapes bake your blend shapes plus

31
0:02:23.420 --> 0:02:28.180
So we have no questions, so I'm just gonna sit here if you've got questions, please drop them into the chat

32
0:02:28.180 --> 0:02:30.180
I see lots of people are talking

33
0:02:30.620 --> 0:02:32.020
Go ahead

34
0:02:32.020 --> 0:02:41.020
tabby-dabby I

35
0:02:44.140 --> 0:02:48.860
List a bunch of reasons why on that page if you disagree with them, that's totally fine. I'll add more as I hear them

36
0:02:48.860 --> 0:02:50.860
You

37
0:03:01.140 --> 0:03:05.400
Know questions, please go ahead type them or get started on questions the moment the questions start appearing

38
0:03:05.660 --> 0:03:09.180
Strangely questions don't usually appear to like a quarter past and it's like ha

39
0:03:10.460 --> 0:03:12.460
Hey

40
0:03:12.460 --> 0:03:19.340
I pretty it's a very good question. Here's a good way of seeing it which is to if you got a sort of blend shape

41
0:03:19.340 --> 0:03:23.180
heavy avatar just go ahead and like take a copy of that and

42
0:03:23.780 --> 0:03:26.620
Should probably say for the recording as pretty as asks

43
0:03:26.660 --> 0:03:31.740
How much does baking blend shapes affect the performance or optimization of at the avatar?

44
0:03:32.020 --> 0:03:34.940
so take an avatar that you have lots of blend shapes on and

45
0:03:35.300 --> 0:03:37.280
Save a copy of it so that you don't you know

46
0:03:37.280 --> 0:03:43.580
You've got to back up and then bake the blend shapes off the avatar then compare the spawning load and performance load on the avatar

47
0:03:43.580 --> 0:03:48.940
when you spawn it out Tom Fox and if Tom Fox is here listening, but Tom Fox did this in one of the

48
0:03:50.420 --> 0:03:52.980
Fernal equinox worlds and it was incredibly

49
0:03:53.980 --> 0:03:58.860
Incredibly obvious which one had been baked and which one had not he literally had his avatar

50
0:03:58.860 --> 0:04:02.980
Which he's wearing and he said that he'd done some optimization particularly for fernal equinox

51
0:04:02.980 --> 0:04:07.140
On the avatar and he was wearing it and he loaded it back into it

52
0:04:07.140 --> 0:04:11.580
No problem whatsoever, and then he loaded into his unoptimized avatar, and it was like ah

53
0:04:12.100 --> 0:04:13.860
I'm dying

54
0:04:13.860 --> 0:04:17.860
So like it does have a lot of impact if you want to see it for example

55
0:04:17.860 --> 0:04:21.340
And you have access to the Rex avatar not blaming Rex avatars Rex avatars much

56
0:04:21.340 --> 0:04:24.700
He's saying a good for testing this because they have a lot of blend shapes because they have a lot of

57
0:04:24.980 --> 0:04:28.380
customizability load into an unbaked Rex and then a baked Rex I

58
0:04:28.380 --> 0:04:30.380
Don't

59
0:04:31.940 --> 0:04:35.340
Really know if I can put it like a metric like how much is what you asked

60
0:04:35.340 --> 0:04:37.620
I don't think I like you know what you want the measurement in

61
0:04:38.060 --> 0:04:45.860
It's purely on so it happens on both loading and just sort of like generic a lot of memory requirements, right? So each

62
0:04:46.940 --> 0:04:53.140
Vertex that moves is is data vertex, which is which are frozen and don't need additional data about where they need to be

63
0:04:53.140 --> 0:04:58.300
I don't need to exist. So if your left pinky doesn't have a blend shape associated with it

64
0:04:58.380 --> 0:05:02.580
Then your left pinky knows in terms of like into the like

65
0:05:02.620 --> 0:05:08.060
You know in the model data in that the theory of the program and network trafficking and loading all sorts of stuff like that

66
0:05:08.060 --> 0:05:11.620
The left pinky is never going to move now, of course, it's going to deform with the bones

67
0:05:11.620 --> 0:05:15.100
So it's probably a bad example what I mean, like it's not going to form with relationships

68
0:05:15.100 --> 0:05:24.460
A ramp asks with what happened on the web and wiki lately would it be feasible to provide official dumps though?

69
0:05:24.460 --> 0:05:29.100
He's similar to how Wikipedia does it this would allow usage of offline wiki really is when needed or desired

70
0:05:29.380 --> 0:05:35.040
We do have backups. We're doing like full-scale backups of basically anything that we don't have access to

71
0:05:35.980 --> 0:05:40.380
So we do sort of like semi-regular basically whenever I like poke wraith and say do it

72
0:05:40.380 --> 0:05:44.980
Backups of the wiki into like third-party locations

73
0:05:44.980 --> 0:05:52.380
We're not providing those currently but we'll provide them when we know where the wiki is heading later see announcements

74
0:05:52.380 --> 0:05:57.020
Basically, we don't control the host that the wiki is on and so we're not kind of like we want to just keep it backed up

75
0:05:57.020 --> 0:05:59.020
So we're keeping it backed up

76
0:05:59.020 --> 0:06:03.660
Once we know what's happening there, we can sort of get backups or whatever sorted

77
0:06:03.980 --> 0:06:06.440
You of course welcome to do your own backup tooling

78
0:06:06.440 --> 0:06:12.840
But like the wiki being down shouldn't actually ever happen especially seeing as it's like it's not a complicated website

79
0:06:12.840 --> 0:06:15.440
It's like we can cache the heck out of that and it'll be fine

80
0:06:17.000 --> 0:06:20.680
We do do do like really smart cache and validation there, it's incredibly easy

81
0:06:20.680 --> 0:06:24.640
It's basically like did someone update the page cool then validate the cache

82
0:06:25.320 --> 0:06:27.320
beautiful cache and validation on that one

83
0:06:27.320 --> 0:06:37.840
So moving along what's on to specs is question now the MMC has wrapped up and you've had a chance to go through it as a judge

84
0:06:37.840 --> 0:06:44.720
Were there any common problems on missed opportunities to optimize that you notice across the board? Yeah presentation was a problem occurred a lot

85
0:06:47.000 --> 0:06:51.920
Always ask a fresh set of eyes to look at your entry it took me a long time to understand quite a few

86
0:06:51.920 --> 0:06:55.420
I really want to like pick out I like any entries in particular

87
0:06:55.420 --> 0:07:01.560
It does happen a lot in sort of tools apps utility. So, um, you might love your application your utility or your tool that you've made

88
0:07:01.560 --> 0:07:04.640
I have no idea what it does. Like I have literally no idea what it does

89
0:07:04.880 --> 0:07:10.840
There was one where like even when it was explained to me by Canadian get hoops in the the world before I'm like

90
0:07:10.840 --> 0:07:13.760
Yeah, but like why does that exist? I don't understand it and

91
0:07:14.200 --> 0:07:19.880
It took probably about ten minutes later. We're on to the next world where I'm like, oh I understand I

92
0:07:19.880 --> 0:07:26.680
Understand that makes sense. Um, so that's a missed opportunity. It's just making sure that we're advertising

93
0:07:27.280 --> 0:07:33.600
Presentation is key. You can see that particularly in a lot of the sort of JP worlds. They do a lot of presentation

94
0:07:33.600 --> 0:07:38.320
They also do a lot of multilingual presentation and that's because they are on the other side of the fence, right?

95
0:07:38.320 --> 0:07:44.240
most of the content we produce in Neos is in English and so they're constantly asking like can we translate that like I know we

96
0:07:44.240 --> 0:07:45.720
Don't have translation for logics right now

97
0:07:45.720 --> 0:07:50.720
That's silly but like they always do the other side of it and they will take anything they're making it translated to English for us

98
0:07:50.720 --> 0:07:57.320
So they're sort of offering an olive brunch and we're just like ignoring it in some cases not actively or intentionally just through like

99
0:07:57.320 --> 0:08:01.400
You know, whatever sort of priorities are piling up. So presentation is always good

100
0:08:01.960 --> 0:08:07.360
For example Coles's entries with the commentary. I would much rather like walk around a world

101
0:08:07.360 --> 0:08:12.680
We've gone commentary mode than read a gigantic board full of credits. It was it's always good to see that they did that in

102
0:08:12.680 --> 0:08:18.000
Hole in the wall and then they did that in Grove Lake. I can never remember if it's 72 or 74

103
0:08:18.600 --> 0:08:23.340
Grove Lake though is what I call it. So it's good to see that as for problems

104
0:08:25.640 --> 0:08:30.760
There were a number of worlds which had white procedural boxes underneath the floor

105
0:08:31.560 --> 0:08:36.600
My very first tutorial ever was on how to configure your collision settings

106
0:08:36.600 --> 0:08:40.600
So you don't need the white box under the floor. Let's take a look at that

107
0:08:40.600 --> 0:08:43.520
It's how to improve your world collision. You can register a mesh

108
0:08:44.120 --> 0:08:50.680
which is a mesh which must be loaded before collisions will actually like before gravity will actually affect the user and

109
0:08:51.160 --> 0:08:54.040
Even if that is a procedural mesh, that's totally fine

110
0:08:54.760 --> 0:09:00.880
But that means that like you could put in your floor mesh and that way it would wait until the floor mesh

111
0:09:01.000 --> 0:09:04.600
Loaded before it engaged gravity and you fall through the ground

112
0:09:05.560 --> 0:09:09.940
Also think about loading as well. There was a great world again by the Japanese community

113
0:09:09.940 --> 0:09:11.940
um Jim I

114
0:09:12.560 --> 0:09:14.320
Geometropolis

115
0:09:14.320 --> 0:09:18.040
Well, he like started in a toilet and it was it was artistic

116
0:09:18.040 --> 0:09:23.120
There was an artistic reason why they started you in a toilet and it was great

117
0:09:23.120 --> 0:09:28.000
But then like 13 people loaded at once and we're like in a toilet and it was just like, huh?

118
0:09:28.800 --> 0:09:35.720
Because we're all in like this one cubicle and it's like what is happening here sometimes happens in media TV films, etc

119
0:09:35.720 --> 0:09:38.640
Way, you know multiple people end up in the same cubicle. That's really comical

120
0:09:38.640 --> 0:09:45.080
I think about using spawn points or spawn areas that have capacity you can spread people out and spawning

121
0:09:45.080 --> 0:09:48.800
They also think about loading, you know, whilst I'm loading sometimes things are kind of scary

122
0:09:50.720 --> 0:09:52.720
Lotus

123
0:09:53.040 --> 0:09:57.280
Lotus Bay yes, Lotus Bay. I can never remember if it's like a valley or a bay it look more like a valley

124
0:09:57.280 --> 0:10:03.480
I wouldn't call it a bay but Lotus Bay they had the breath effect and you spawned outside and so whilst the breath effect was

125
0:10:03.480 --> 0:10:05.480
loading I had like

126
0:10:05.480 --> 0:10:11.560
Squares appearing in front of my face, so I didn't know why or what and it was just like, you know until that loads

127
0:10:11.560 --> 0:10:13.960
I don't know what that is. So just just think about loading as well

128
0:10:14.440 --> 0:10:16.400
I was

129
0:10:16.400 --> 0:10:19.520
Happy to see a lot less issues of multiplayer issues

130
0:10:19.600 --> 0:10:25.320
We did still have some but there are a lot sort of less there in the game category. I did notice a lot of people still

131
0:10:26.920 --> 0:10:31.420
Misunderstanding maybe intentionally maybe not intentionally it depends on sort of like your understanding of it

132
0:10:31.420 --> 0:10:33.600
So I'll do some videos on the asset management system

133
0:10:33.600 --> 0:10:35.280
I

134
0:10:35.280 --> 0:10:40.800
Understand storing materials within your world hierarchy for easy access and standardization, you know

135
0:10:40.800 --> 0:10:45.440
If you need to go find it, but our people are also storing things like textures static texture components

136
0:10:45.960 --> 0:10:51.320
Other things like that inside a separate asset folder within the top root of their world

137
0:10:51.320 --> 0:10:57.080
That makes it difficult for the asset system to automatically optimize and stream in different versions of your assets

138
0:10:57.320 --> 0:11:02.600
Because you're saying like hey don't use the asset version system of this use this exact image

139
0:11:02.600 --> 0:11:04.400
So try and avoid that

140
0:11:04.400 --> 0:11:09.400
You know, there are optimizations at play that we can do for you if you use the asset system

141
0:11:10.040 --> 0:11:12.840
And if you don't let me count a common one with that

142
0:11:12.840 --> 0:11:17.240
I see is if you put like the assets or the materials etc on your avatar

143
0:11:17.240 --> 0:11:20.160
I should really only have materials stored on your avatar if you're driving them

144
0:11:20.240 --> 0:11:25.400
So if you're playing around with the colors of your avatar store them on your avatar or if you're playing around other properties and materials

145
0:11:25.400 --> 0:11:27.320
Animate them etc restore my avatar. That's fine

146
0:11:27.320 --> 0:11:33.440
if not, let the asset management system handle it and that means that if you are respawned if you are like duplicate your avatar or

147
0:11:33.440 --> 0:11:35.440
something you will

148
0:11:36.960 --> 0:11:43.040
Load in a lot quicker because when you're respawning it won't have to recreate those assets or refetch those assets because they're like already

149
0:11:43.240 --> 0:11:46.960
Yes, some management system. There's lots of stuff there. That's like really

150
0:11:47.800 --> 0:11:49.800
difficult

151
0:11:50.280 --> 0:11:52.280
To talk about there

152
0:11:52.280 --> 0:11:58.700
Um, but who knows well, I'll have to see what happens with it

153
0:11:59.400 --> 0:12:01.400
weird filing noises

154
0:12:02.520 --> 0:12:04.840
Coming from I don't really know what's going on

155
0:12:04.840 --> 0:12:10.000
I may have to jump away my building management are visiting my an apartment at some point today or tomorrow

156
0:12:13.480 --> 0:12:15.480
To update

157
0:12:16.480 --> 0:12:19.640
Sorry, it's really weird. I may have to cut things short. I'm just a little bit here. Um

158
0:12:19.640 --> 0:12:27.040
Where was I so specs follows up that question with interesting notes materials in the world hierarchy makes sense

159
0:12:27.040 --> 0:12:30.360
But not textures themselves. I don't think any of them do

160
0:12:31.760 --> 0:12:33.760
But I know that some people do it for various reasons

161
0:12:36.200 --> 0:12:38.400
Let's look through on other matters here

162
0:12:38.400 --> 0:12:48.320
The clap plan this is not a question but a small spelling mistake to the be considerate page totally fine doesn't matter

163
0:12:56.160 --> 0:12:59.720
Yeah, like spelling doesn't matter on my ranty page feel free to correct it if you'd like to

164
0:13:01.080 --> 0:13:03.860
Ozi asks, is there anything that surprised you during the MMC?

165
0:13:03.860 --> 0:13:09.860
I'm always surprised at the sort of like whiteness that people have when their creations

166
0:13:09.940 --> 0:13:14.940
It's very interesting to see like what people interpret things as especially when the stuff it feels

167
0:13:15.260 --> 0:13:20.500
Miscategorized like it's up to you which category you put it in like we have to act upon that and judge a category based on

168
0:13:20.500 --> 0:13:23.140
That but there were some games that should have been in game

169
0:13:23.140 --> 0:13:26.720
But one in game there were some social things that should have been in social

170
0:13:26.720 --> 0:13:29.940
But we're in game there were some social things that were in other that should have been in

171
0:13:29.940 --> 0:13:36.700
Game or other or social like think about the category again. I don't want to call out things, but it's basically like

172
0:13:37.300 --> 0:13:43.500
For social particularly. It's am I meant to relax here and will I revisit this world and have fun there like

173
0:13:45.020 --> 0:13:50.540
That's really what like has social for me. You know I don't want any barriers to my social nurse

174
0:13:50.540 --> 0:13:52.860
Um so there's one particular social map that had

175
0:13:54.340 --> 0:13:58.260
Barriers to my ability to be social in that world that was kind of strange

176
0:13:58.260 --> 0:14:04.580
And then above that is just the sort of variety of some of the the tools that we're still seeing

177
0:14:04.820 --> 0:14:08.180
People like I bet I could do that if I ever tried it

178
0:14:08.180 --> 0:14:12.900
I bet I could do this or could I do this and it's just like what never really thought of it

179
0:14:12.900 --> 0:14:17.600
I was interesting this year as well because we had like we didn't have many like our entries the

180
0:14:18.060 --> 0:14:21.300
Ray thought provoking for me. I like weird art if you see my Twitter

181
0:14:21.300 --> 0:14:25.220
I retweet weird art like all the time and I even made a weird art like entry

182
0:14:25.220 --> 0:14:28.420
It's hard to explain. We didn't have a lot of sort of what I would call

183
0:14:29.260 --> 0:14:31.540
General art, but there wasn't sort of any art that like

184
0:14:32.380 --> 0:14:36.860
Appealed to like my actual like taste and oh, but that's fine like I'm there to judge

185
0:14:36.860 --> 0:14:40.060
What's there not to judge? What's not there, but yeah, I would like to see

186
0:14:40.740 --> 0:14:45.860
Different areas of art. I'm not like an art boffin or anything. I kind of hate art boffins

187
0:14:46.740 --> 0:14:52.380
Especially when they're like yes this painting of two lions is worth 32 million dollars like I don't understand

188
0:14:52.380 --> 0:14:55.380
But there are pieces of art which are like really

189
0:14:55.660 --> 0:15:00.460
Strange compared to just sort of the normal sort of a painting of a lady is sitting at a table

190
0:15:02.900 --> 0:15:09.220
Which you know you see a lot, but yeah, so it's good to see that we keep seeing like gaps or needs for like other categories

191
0:15:09.220 --> 0:15:11.220
I know someone wanted I

192
0:15:11.980 --> 0:15:14.860
Actually can't remember that were like it would be great if we had this as a category

193
0:15:14.860 --> 0:15:16.020
I don't know what that is

194
0:15:16.020 --> 0:15:20.340
I think they were looking for like world experience or something because they're like it's not a game

195
0:15:20.340 --> 0:15:27.060
but it's like a I don't know it wasn't it sort of like the the Venn diagram of like museum tour and

196
0:15:27.540 --> 0:15:32.140
Video game and in the middle is where they wanted world experience, so it's quite weird in that regard

197
0:15:34.900 --> 0:15:39.260
Okay, let's move down through questions froppies link the video make sure that's on the note somehow

198
0:15:39.260 --> 0:15:42.660
I think I can edit them. I don't know. We'll see what like a server trying this new tooling

199
0:15:43.700 --> 0:15:45.940
Recordings going great. We'll see what happens there

200
0:15:45.940 --> 0:15:50.500
We couldn't yeah, we're good on everything um

201
0:15:52.340 --> 0:15:57.660
Okay, we have no other questions here play code is talking about some of the entries. That's great

202
0:16:01.060 --> 0:16:06.900
Play Cody says I've noticed that when deleting accident deleting an object and bring it back that most of the meshes or materials come back

203
0:16:06.900 --> 0:16:13.780
It defined as asset holders. Yes, that's correct. That's a that's how that system works. There is a sort of video

204
0:16:13.780 --> 0:16:17.420
I couldn't work out whether it was correct. I watched it, and I had to ask

205
0:16:18.060 --> 0:16:21.900
Jax to go take a look at it again. They did like creating a fence with like

206
0:16:23.060 --> 0:16:27.220
Preserve preservation of assets. I'm not sure if they did it correctly, but it was a good sort of thing basically

207
0:16:27.220 --> 0:16:30.140
They made like a fence post and then they duplicated it a few times

208
0:16:30.140 --> 0:16:33.420
They were trying to sort of say like here's the best way to duplicate to make sure that you have like one

209
0:16:33.700 --> 0:16:38.820
Fence post mesh, but I'm not sure if they did it correctly so video content on that one ain't around to it

210
0:16:38.820 --> 0:16:42.620
If you have further questions, please go ahead and typey-type

211
0:16:55.620 --> 0:17:02.100
Play Cody comments on the world experience category as saying like a visual novel, but like a cinema

212
0:17:02.100 --> 0:17:10.220
He recalls seeing free apps where the person sits down doesn't move, and there's like a movie that plays in the background um

213
0:17:11.540 --> 0:17:15.940
Maybe that would fit in there like a good example would be like there was a meme entry from

214
0:17:16.980 --> 0:17:18.980
from Danny of course which was

215
0:17:20.780 --> 0:17:27.260
Joyful guy I was trying to remember the sort of adjective that came before that like joyful joyful guy, which was really clever like

216
0:17:27.260 --> 0:17:32.700
you you sat in a box, and then the box moved around the world and

217
0:17:33.340 --> 0:17:36.660
It was like really weird so theater there

218
0:17:37.500 --> 0:17:42.140
Especially the second run through you can sit in the chair play the animation through and you're like great

219
0:17:42.140 --> 0:17:45.460
That was cool, and then you can get out the chair, but hit play on the animation

220
0:17:45.460 --> 0:17:48.980
You can just see like the the chair and the box is sort of like zooming around

221
0:17:49.180 --> 0:17:53.540
It was a great explosion of what you can do of animation with the limit and animation systems that we had

222
0:17:53.540 --> 0:17:59.100
It was also interesting. We didn't have anyone ask because I think they're all aware on the judging team

223
0:17:59.660 --> 0:18:04.460
But if they were not aware then would have explained to them because there was no sound in the entry of course

224
0:18:04.460 --> 0:18:05.620
There's no sound

225
0:18:05.620 --> 0:18:10.180
But it does become like an interesting sort of area like is that something we can judge like are we being?

226
0:18:10.540 --> 0:18:16.540
Unfair to the user by judging because they don't have sounds or are we being unfair to not judge them because they don't have sounds

227
0:18:16.540 --> 0:18:18.540
It becomes sort of interesting

228
0:18:18.820 --> 0:18:22.140
conversations there about sort of accessibility and judging we also had

229
0:18:22.140 --> 0:18:27.460
A Turks teams entry where you couldn't speak to each other for until you found the talking stick

230
0:18:27.780 --> 0:18:30.420
That entry was again interesting because it was like hey

231
0:18:30.940 --> 0:18:35.820
We can't talk to each other so again. That was a play on sort of removing an ability from someone

232
0:18:35.820 --> 0:18:53.180
That made things interesting. There's like instruction going on outside of my like boarding up my door. Maybe I'm trapped. I don't know all right

233
0:18:53.180 --> 0:19:06.300
Keep your questions going. I'm gonna go look through my people of my door all

234
0:19:06.300 --> 0:19:21.500
Right well, I don't see any other questions, so any other questions

235
0:19:21.500 --> 0:19:23.780
Do you let me know about ten minutes left on the office hours?

236
0:19:23.780 --> 0:19:26.140
I can always quit it early if he there's no more questions I

237
0:19:29.620 --> 0:19:34.420
Could talk about MMC like forever though, so it's interesting to see some stuff

238
0:19:34.420 --> 0:19:42.100
I don't really answer. How am I today? Is it just like it's it's an office hours about yes, and yes stuff

239
0:19:46.460 --> 0:19:50.820
And to have an answer it just like you know it gets off topic pretty fast

240
0:19:55.020 --> 0:20:00.220
Crusher I already answer that one upstairs. I say upstairs sometimes, and I don't mean it. I mean it like

241
0:20:01.180 --> 0:20:03.140
location based not like

242
0:20:03.140 --> 0:20:11.060
Physically upstairs, so they said like I answered the upstairs. I bet I answered that earlier, and I meant like hi

243
0:20:13.180 --> 0:20:16.260
In the scroll feed not like literally upstairs

244
0:20:16.260 --> 0:20:20.100
There's sometimes when I'm like higher in a Neos world than someone else

245
0:20:20.100 --> 0:20:23.960
Maybe they're lower and there isn't like stairs involved. You know we're on no clip most of the time

246
0:20:23.960 --> 0:20:28.340
And I'm just like oh yeah, they're downstairs. What do you mean? There's no stairs in this entry?

247
0:20:28.340 --> 0:20:33.740
It's like well. They're downstairs. There was an entry at the MMC that has a lot of downstairs though

248
0:20:33.740 --> 0:20:35.740
I do not remember the name of it

249
0:20:36.220 --> 0:20:38.220
Is that visual experience?

250
0:20:39.380 --> 0:20:42.180
Appeared to be sort of playing on sort of dementia etc

251
0:20:45.260 --> 0:20:47.940
Reviewing so many entries they're just like a blur often

252
0:20:47.940 --> 0:20:51.820
I don't remember the name, but I don't have to find it a burning memory. Oh there you go

253
0:20:51.820 --> 0:20:56.260
Thank you so much that was that was interesting. It was like yeah, actually we could go downstairs

254
0:20:56.260 --> 0:20:59.400
We had some issues. They're running it with multiple people

255
0:21:00.080 --> 0:21:06.360
It's the team that built if they're listening go check it through with multiple people in the end. I actually got sort of

256
0:21:07.360 --> 0:21:14.360
Frustrated with the pacing of having multiple people doing it and so I ended it myself like I split off the judging into

257
0:21:14.560 --> 0:21:16.560
multiple people

258
0:21:16.920 --> 0:21:21.800
So that I could enjoy it by myself, and I thought I could judge it a lot better

259
0:21:21.800 --> 0:21:28.600
Experiencing it by myself rather than what inevitably happened because the whole thing was like that entry was about a routine

260
0:21:28.600 --> 0:21:31.440
It was you wake up your brush your teeth you go downstairs. You have coffee

261
0:21:31.440 --> 0:21:38.120
I don't know why brushing your teeth and then having coffee was the routine because there's always that meme about brushing your teeth then drinking

262
0:21:38.120 --> 0:21:40.120
orange juice or apple juice

263
0:21:40.400 --> 0:21:45.960
Just like not a good thing to do because it tastes completely different same thing with coffee, but that was the routine

264
0:21:46.080 --> 0:21:50.560
But what we usually happen in a multiplayer scenario, and it isn't actually something you can code for is

265
0:21:50.560 --> 0:21:52.560
some

266
0:21:53.120 --> 0:21:57.720
Player one would be brushing their teeth and player two would already be downstairs at the coffee machine

267
0:21:57.720 --> 0:22:03.060
And so like the whole sort of sequence of events was broken which did actually result in some bugs

268
0:22:03.060 --> 0:22:08.320
But also result in a bug sort of narratively based because it was all about that repeated narrative

269
0:22:12.240 --> 0:22:15.240
We did not record actually no we did record our judging for

270
0:22:15.240 --> 0:22:22.520
Like gavel reasons medra is really obsessed with legalities this year to make sense because the the size of the

271
0:22:23.560 --> 0:22:25.560
prize pool

272
0:22:25.760 --> 0:22:28.960
Why is it renamed themselves today anyway?

273
0:22:33.240 --> 0:22:35.160
Moving onwards

274
0:22:35.160 --> 0:22:37.960
So medra has a copy of it. We won't be posting it

275
0:22:37.960 --> 0:22:43.160
We don't want to post really sort of any of the sort of in-depth judging discussions or voting

276
0:22:43.160 --> 0:22:45.520
Discussions because the results are final

277
0:22:46.040 --> 0:22:49.800
And it leads to arguments. We've tried it before and it led to arguments

278
0:22:50.040 --> 0:22:56.840
We won't be posting the voting time least because it leads to arguments at least trauma like it's not about the specific sort of it

279
0:22:57.960 --> 0:23:01.480
Something which I would like to do, but the timing just didn't work out

280
0:23:01.480 --> 0:23:06.120
It's a busy time of veneers if you look around you know stuff happen

281
0:23:06.520 --> 0:23:08.160
I

282
0:23:08.160 --> 0:23:14.240
Would love to sort of have the voting period and then after the voting period I'd love to go through all of the entries by

283
0:23:14.240 --> 0:23:17.680
Myself and then do the sort of judging criteria

284
0:23:19.400 --> 0:23:24.200
As a separate meeting so it would be like voting where I don't anything out of course because I'm an influencer

285
0:23:24.600 --> 0:23:28.680
Voting period ends I run through all the entries myself to get my first impressions

286
0:23:28.680 --> 0:23:32.220
And then I didn't run through the the judging process privately

287
0:23:32.220 --> 0:23:35.000
And then you'll be able to see that middle one there and see their first experience

288
0:23:35.000 --> 0:23:39.840
Good examples of first experience is that something you can't recreate are things like

289
0:23:40.560 --> 0:23:43.480
Neolander like when we went to ring of the Neolander, I think

290
0:23:45.040 --> 0:23:47.920
Two-thirds of us have been there before and so we knew

291
0:23:49.120 --> 0:23:54.520
We knew how the Neolander ring worked, and we were just you know happily building things taking a second look at it

292
0:23:54.560 --> 0:24:00.120
But of course we had some guest judges now guest judges are outside of Neos like they're not Neos community members

293
0:24:00.120 --> 0:24:02.000
They're not Neos team members, so they're not

294
0:24:02.000 --> 0:24:06.920
Expected to view all the entries are only expected to view the ones we got a tour with you know the sort of almost the

295
0:24:06.920 --> 0:24:08.920
final decisions and so

296
0:24:09.120 --> 0:24:10.880
We took those through that one

297
0:24:10.880 --> 0:24:16.140
And it's like I don't want to say anything here like I want them to judge Neolander as a new user and so if they

298
0:24:16.160 --> 0:24:18.960
Struggle with setting it up. I want them to struggle setting up

299
0:24:19.920 --> 0:24:23.680
But I was already on my second impression where it's like yeah, I've used this thing

300
0:24:25.080 --> 0:24:27.200
That thing had great tactile audio design

301
0:24:27.200 --> 0:24:31.200
Um so I kind of just sort of like hid behind a tree and used it again

302
0:24:31.200 --> 0:24:33.200
So people didn't see what I was doing

303
0:24:33.520 --> 0:24:37.720
But it would be good to see this first impression because I was confused at first. There's a lot of entries where I'm confused at first

304
0:24:39.320 --> 0:24:45.280
Except puzzle games like NCR the heist I think I could probably speedrun that thing like the first run through I could probably speedrun

305
0:24:45.280 --> 0:24:48.200
But I'm just like oh, I need to go over here got it cool

306
0:24:49.160 --> 0:24:52.400
If you're in a maze, or you don't know where you're going always stick to the left wall

307
0:24:52.400 --> 0:24:55.760
Just keeps to the left or left wall left wall left wall

308
0:24:55.760 --> 0:25:01.560
Most mazes unless they're what are called disjointed mazes allow the left wall scenario to work

309
0:25:01.560 --> 0:25:03.800
It works in most video games where there is a sort of

310
0:25:04.760 --> 0:25:10.760
Branching path to get where you're going hug the left will get everywhere did that in Elden Ring last night

311
0:25:10.760 --> 0:25:15.520
There's a sewer area where it's really maze like and I just hugged the left wall and managed to see everything

312
0:25:15.920 --> 0:25:21.220
There is a little bit disjointness there though because it's a bit like non-linear. I love non-linear games

313
0:25:21.220 --> 0:25:26.700
There was an inspiration hill someone said that we're looking at doing anti-chamber in the US and that they'd unfortunately quit that project

314
0:25:26.700 --> 0:25:33.060
So do something similar maybe not as big as anti-chamber in the US, but do non-linear stuff. We had mirror room

315
0:25:34.420 --> 0:25:40.500
And we have that reflection game last year mirror room and a reflection game last year. I've got the non-nucleation tunnel

316
0:25:40.500 --> 0:25:50.720
There's a few more non-nucleation things I see in people's inventories and stuff make more non-nucleation stuff. It's great. It's great. So

317
0:25:52.660 --> 0:25:58.300
Player Cody asks isn't most games kind of like doing specific chores meeting certain tasks into progress

318
0:25:59.340 --> 0:26:00.700
Not most games at all

319
0:26:00.700 --> 0:26:01.020
No

320
0:26:01.020 --> 0:26:06.500
There are a type of like a sub-genre of puzzle games where I call them like to-do list games where you just basically like

321
0:26:06.500 --> 0:26:10.660
I get it. I just got to do this. I get it. I just got to do this. I

322
0:26:12.820 --> 0:26:16.060
Get it, I just sort of do this, you know, it's it's it's crazy like that

323
0:26:16.060 --> 0:26:23.260
So maybe the burning memory does sort of qualify as that but it has a reason to like it's trying to tell a story with that

324
0:26:23.260 --> 0:26:25.260
That's totally fine

325
0:26:25.460 --> 0:26:28.580
Same thing with like Stanley Parable would be a good example there

326
0:26:28.580 --> 0:26:31.860
You're doing the same thing over and over again because it's part of the experience

327
0:26:31.860 --> 0:26:38.940
Whereas there's a sub-genre of puzzle games called hidden object games where it's like you've entered the spooky house

328
0:26:39.220 --> 0:26:44.100
Find the key for the secret vampire lair. You need to like look at a

329
0:26:44.980 --> 0:26:47.420
picture of the house and find a

330
0:26:48.340 --> 0:26:54.740
Cheese grater that's like hidden behind the first the third banister and like that that that's not a puzzle game

331
0:26:54.740 --> 0:26:58.060
That's just like visual recognition, but some people like those

332
0:26:58.060 --> 0:27:02.020
I know the hidden object games are particularly popular with like

333
0:27:03.580 --> 0:27:07.380
Some demographic because there's tons of them tons of

334
0:27:09.580 --> 0:27:13.580
Moving onwards to definitely not get why have you renamed yourself? I'll ask later

335
0:27:14.300 --> 0:27:19.680
Hypothetically if the audio recording and transcription system works permanently, would you be willing to show someone else how to set up? Yes sounder fm

336
0:27:20.260 --> 0:27:27.060
I'll just post that chat sounder fm. It's basically a podcasting website and they're like free audio transcription and I'm like hell yeah

337
0:27:27.060 --> 0:27:32.060
I basically stop recording on my recording upload it to sounder. It does all your transcription

338
0:27:32.060 --> 0:27:34.640
I predict it's going to be terrible particularly when I say things like

339
0:27:35.180 --> 0:27:36.780
fruits

340
0:27:36.780 --> 0:27:42.220
Git siro and all the like weird, you know, it's screen names that you guys have

341
0:27:43.460 --> 0:27:50.660
Audio recognition is of course trained on common words and sort of with the sort of end diagram and inclusion of

342
0:27:50.660 --> 0:27:56.860
VR VR development and then funny screen names. It's not probably not going to do good

343
0:27:56.860 --> 0:27:59.260
But they actually have features to do with that which is why I chose them

344
0:28:00.420 --> 0:28:05.140
They will see like hey, we've heard this name a few times. For example, if they keep hearing fruits and

345
0:28:05.700 --> 0:28:11.660
They see it as fruit exactly as tempestrel just said I could say hey every time I say fruit

346
0:28:11.660 --> 0:28:18.020
I actually mean this and then type and it will update the audio transcription on the on the fly. It's called something like

347
0:28:18.020 --> 0:28:22.940
A term replacement. I can't remember the name of the feature, but it'll basically be like, oh, okay. Sorry

348
0:28:22.940 --> 0:28:28.580
We made that mistake and they'll feed that data back to their audio transcription services. So see if they can make it better

349
0:28:37.740 --> 0:28:39.740
All right moving onwards to

350
0:28:40.260 --> 0:28:47.340
Another question from lurking this will the there will there be any effort to mainstream years going forward? I love to see more players

351
0:28:47.340 --> 0:28:49.340
Yes, we are. Absolutely dying

352
0:28:49.980 --> 0:28:55.940
Jumping at the seams to try and like get more development going. We have stuff going on behind the scenes as well

353
0:28:55.940 --> 0:29:00.940
Like they're still working on stuff. It's more sort of random. It's not directed. It's not motivated. It's not moving in the same direction

354
0:29:01.620 --> 0:29:03.380
because

355
0:29:03.380 --> 0:29:05.380
See announcements etc

356
0:29:05.540 --> 0:29:07.540
We are doing stuff though. Like I know

357
0:29:07.820 --> 0:29:12.500
Earlier I open up the code based is look at I think it's such a shock mayor if they're still watching

358
0:29:12.500 --> 0:29:18.620
or listening Chuck mayor and their interpolation issue where they're like hey when we interpret the hints we do it wrong and I'm like

359
0:29:18.620 --> 0:29:22.980
I'll open up the code base and see what's going on there because that's confusing to me mathematically

360
0:29:22.980 --> 0:29:26.820
And I want to see that there's a mathematical reason that's happenings. We just need to find out what that is

361
0:29:27.620 --> 0:29:29.920
So I open up the the code base

362
0:29:30.500 --> 0:29:31.860
To see what's going on there

363
0:29:31.860 --> 0:29:36.620
I think it's probably doing some sort of curve maths and the curve is just like wrong for integers

364
0:29:36.620 --> 0:29:38.880
And so it's it's it's exceeding its bounds somehow

365
0:29:38.880 --> 0:29:42.240
It actually happens on happens of the graphing component a lot as well

366
0:29:42.240 --> 0:29:47.200
It happened on the graphing component on the left hand side of the graph and I reported it and freaks is like I fixed it

367
0:29:47.200 --> 0:29:51.120
And like no the bug actually just moved to the right hand side of the graph

368
0:29:51.120 --> 0:29:55.120
So we've got a look at that one again, and maybe I'll take a look at some point

369
0:29:55.120 --> 0:29:58.160
But yeah, well, we're dying to get development going forwards

370
0:29:59.360 --> 0:30:01.360
so

371
0:30:02.080 --> 0:30:03.760
Gun Griffin

372
0:30:03.760 --> 0:30:05.760
Doesn't doesn't work changing name doesn't work

373
0:30:05.760 --> 0:30:08.880
Changing name doesn't work asks. What's the best?

374
0:30:11.680 --> 0:30:14.960
What is the best method to set up a headless client for the first time

375
0:30:15.440 --> 0:30:18.720
Uh, take a look at the headless client guide. I also do tutorials on it

376
0:30:18.800 --> 0:30:21.120
There is a lot of information on the wiki. I don't know why it's not linked

377
0:30:21.200 --> 0:30:26.000
I see questions in the headless client channel all the time where they're like, what does the configuration property mean?

378
0:30:26.240 --> 0:30:28.960
I mean i've i've documented them all on the wiki. So

379
0:30:29.600 --> 0:30:34.560
So go take a look at I do actually recommend as well that you set one up locally on a computer that you own

380
0:30:34.560 --> 0:30:39.200
That's like next to you. Maybe it's an old laptop. Maybe it's even the computer that you play on. I know someone does that

381
0:30:40.000 --> 0:30:42.000
and try and get it working because

382
0:30:42.160 --> 0:30:44.240
Once you get it working, you'll be a bit more confident

383
0:30:45.280 --> 0:30:48.320
If you want to set it up on a server that's located outside of your house

384
0:30:48.480 --> 0:30:52.560
Like somewhere in a cloud or data center or something like that. You need to be familiar with

385
0:30:53.040 --> 0:30:55.040
Logging into that server be a vm

386
0:30:55.680 --> 0:30:56.960
Like a windows like, you know

387
0:30:56.960 --> 0:31:02.640
The the blue bar at the top logging into a vm or if it's maybe a linux terminal get familiar with that stuff first because

388
0:31:02.640 --> 0:31:06.480
That will be the the cincher for you once you've got that sorted

389
0:31:06.480 --> 0:31:10.800
It really is just as simple as running mono space like headless client or whatever it is

390
0:31:11.120 --> 0:31:18.080
Xe and then it loading a json file like it's simple learn json too. Jason. Um, if you're interested in computing a tool

391
0:31:18.480 --> 0:31:20.480
I want you to learn json

392
0:31:20.800 --> 0:31:23.680
And I I don't care if you're interested in json

393
0:31:24.080 --> 0:31:29.600
If you're interested in computing programming or anything like that. I want you to learn json, uh, the jason spec

394
0:31:29.600 --> 0:31:32.800
Is listed on the official website for json

395
0:31:33.040 --> 0:31:40.160
It's presented as like a weird flow chart, but it's like really really really really important that you learn. Jason

396
0:31:40.560 --> 0:31:42.640
Uh, you can also use a site called jason lint

397
0:31:42.800 --> 0:31:48.240
Uh, there's many like things that can do this but basically like type json and then chuck it into jason lint

398
0:31:48.240 --> 0:31:50.240
And let you know if there's a problem

399
0:31:54.080 --> 0:31:55.440
Uh player coding has a question

400
0:31:55.440 --> 0:32:00.960
This will be the last question actually froppy sharkman tempestrel. If you're asking a question, please type it. Otherwise, no more questions

401
0:32:01.520 --> 0:32:07.440
We're at time. Um, so player cody asks speaking of the wiki when wanting to add contribute to it. Uh

402
0:32:08.560 --> 0:32:11.920
Is it best to look through the different pages confirm info wanting to be shared is already there

403
0:32:12.000 --> 0:32:16.240
I'll go through the search bar and put keyword all of those things. Um, search for information to see if it's there

404
0:32:16.560 --> 0:32:19.280
Don't search for information. See if it's there is is a bad fight

405
0:32:19.280 --> 0:32:23.120
So just check it's there before you do it wait a question a couple of weeks ago at the office hours

406
0:32:23.120 --> 0:32:27.280
Which is something on the lens of like when are we going to document what a logic node does on the wiki?

407
0:32:27.280 --> 0:32:31.040
And i'm like, well that's already kind of there. Maybe you didn't search for it

408
0:32:31.040 --> 0:32:33.760
Or maybe you'll do some visibility or discovery sort of solutions there

409
0:32:34.240 --> 0:32:35.680
Who knows but yeah, just look for it

410
0:32:35.680 --> 0:32:38.320
There's also a link on the left hand side of the wiki called contributing

411
0:32:38.400 --> 0:32:41.520
And there's a contributing page there that talks about how to do it and why to do it

412
0:32:42.400 --> 0:32:44.400
Just as a reminder for everyone

413
0:32:44.560 --> 0:32:47.040
Anyone can contribute to the wiki

414
0:32:47.040 --> 0:32:54.560
Your grandmother your grandfather your aunt your niece your nephew your daughter your son your sister your brother

415
0:32:55.200 --> 0:32:59.540
Your next-door neighbor can contribute to the wiki. There is no restriction whatsoever

416
0:32:59.600 --> 0:33:04.240
If you want to type go type I don't care if you make a mess. I'll just fix it for you. Honestly

417
0:33:04.240 --> 0:33:07.280
I'll just fix it for you. I won't even be mad if

418
0:33:08.560 --> 0:33:14.080
You know 50 of how a node works go type it there if you know 10 of how a node works go type it there

419
0:33:14.080 --> 0:33:16.880
If you have a sentence about the node

420
0:33:17.520 --> 0:33:21.920
That provides detail to our users that is not there go type that sentence

421
0:33:21.920 --> 0:33:26.400
I don't even care if you just start a new page and put that one sentence on it if that's all you know about it

422
0:33:26.400 --> 0:33:28.400
Go start that page

423
0:33:29.840 --> 0:33:31.840
Documentation is a sort of

424
0:33:32.400 --> 0:33:34.400
progressive enhancement thing

425
0:33:35.200 --> 0:33:38.240
Think about it like, you know cleaning your house. I need to do that

426
0:33:38.640 --> 0:33:42.720
Sometimes just starting is the problem if I stood up now and I took out the trash

427
0:33:42.720 --> 0:33:45.920
I've started cleaning so start that documentation

428
0:33:51.360 --> 0:33:59.360
Last question from lucky because we're running it really long time lucky moose asks will dedicated hosting beyond near servers by default rather than the host computer in the future

429
0:33:59.360 --> 0:34:01.360
That is something we're looking into it's on the roadmap

430
0:34:02.400 --> 0:34:09.200
Details TBD right now headless client is the way to host headless things. It's not really even a server servers would be a little bit different

431
0:34:09.200 --> 0:34:13.680
It's a headless client, but people just call it servers it for clo-co reasons

432
0:34:14.480 --> 0:34:17.680
Take a look at the wiki and there's a link above from froppy about that

433
0:34:18.800 --> 0:34:24.160
With that that's all the time I have I gotta run so I will see you guys next week if you have any questions in the meantime do

434
0:34:25.680 --> 0:34:28.320
Make noises in my general direction DM me or whatever later

435
0:34:28.880 --> 0:34:34.720
I will be posting the link to the recording of this which should have hopefully been audio transcribed in a way that makes sense

436
0:34:34.720 --> 0:34:37.760
Or I'll just do regular notes, but the recording will be up on that

437
0:34:37.760 --> 0:34:40.800
Podcasting website soon. I'll speak to you guys later. Bye. Bye
