1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
 It is 4 p.m. So go ahead and get started. Welcome to office hours with Prime.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,440
 Let's take a look at the questions that we have if we have any.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,960
 Oh!

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,540
 "Peacole asks what have you been up to lately? Prime not specifically a newest question, just a general one." I booked movers today.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,160
 So they arrive on the 2nd, I get keys on the 1st.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,520
 They'll be grabbing all the crap that I boxed up and the couch and stuff and taking it downstairs.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,200
 Yeah, new place. I'm not looking forward to it, but whatever, it'll be done.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,640
 Within like a week, I'll be sat at this exact same desk in this exact same chair just in a different location.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,480
 So it doesn't really matter. Not within a week, but like a week of the move, like it's the 1st. I get keys.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,040
 Anyway, um,

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,920
 $800 a month cheaper at the new place.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,460
 $800 cheaper. $800. I also lose my balcony, which I don't use anyway, so there's just no point in the balcony existing.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,720
 Yeah, that's what I've been up to. There are no... Oh, there we go. We got that question answered as well.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,080
 There are no additional questions, so we're just gonna sit here.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,520
 Oh, that's a good question.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:13,040
 "Hack13 asks, is there any truth to the rumor about the tail root virus thing I heard about in some NeosVR servers getting attached to people's avatars and making stick drafts?"

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
 That exists. It is there.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,560
 It is very similar to a similar situation we had a few years ago.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,840
 I don't want to use the term virus because it confuses people that are new to Neos.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,640
 It is an apt description though, but like it is there. I believe there's some tools to get rid of it, etc.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,560
 Whenever anyone does something like that, I just sort of think like, why?

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,640
 Usually they don't realize what they're doing. They're just like, you know, "Oh, I did a thing" and it's like, "Cool,

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,840
 did you need to? Is your life better because you've done that thing? Do you feel accomplished in life because you've done that thing?"

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,000
 There we go. So Beagle posted in the chat there a link to the doobly-doos to get rid of it.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,960
 I would advise not saving

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,880
 basically anything in a public world right now.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:08,320
 Hack 13 says, "Is there no way for staff to find and identify the offending asset and blacklist it?"

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,920
 No, because it's not like a single asset.

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,040
 So

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,880
 let's take for example the example of say a mesh or a texture, right?

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,320
 So we can search for a mesh or a texture very very easily.

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:28,200
 So let's say that you have a high quality mesh of a chicken nugget that cost $8.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,800
 You could easily find that mesh because it's unique, right? There's only one chicken nugget that looks like that.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,040
 And so we can easily find that. However, when it comes to this particular issue,

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,880
 it's just a collection of logics nodes and those logics nodes are self-duplicating. And once they're duplicated,

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,680
 there's nothing really to say that they are different or distinct from one another.

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,520
 Something which we need to do probably in the future is start forming some sort of antivirus or heuristics about this.

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,400
 I was thinking about this in bed last night. None of these ideas are potentially good.

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,760
 They are just ideas, remember? No bad ideas exist in literally anything. Even if they're proven bad,

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,240
 it's because they're proven bad, not because they actually start out bad.

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,360
 So I'm like, what if you take every logic's chain and

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,640
 someone hashed that because then you'd get some sort of ID. That's how early virus detection works.

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,360
 They sort of just hashed files. That doesn't work because then people started messing and making hashes, but maybe that would work.

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,080
 Then you can start doing a hash based not on the structure, but based on the behavior.

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,240
 So it does this, then this, then this, then that, and that's heuristics, etc.

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,040
 That's the sort of stuff that we would need to go ahead and find it.

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,880
 The other problem is some of the stuff that it does is

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,880
 needed for other applications. For example, we can't just block the duplicate slot node because that's used for a lot of legitimate cases.

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,520
 Guns use that a lot,

50
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,560
 particularly like rocket launchers and stuff like that.

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,780
 So yeah, it's a very challenging problem. But yeah, people are like, is that a rumor? Well,

52
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,200
 that one's like easy, right? You can go see it. You can hear about it.

53
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
 You just look in the Discord about it.

54
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,360
 The original Nenis Rec doesn't help as well because that's just like it packaged in its original container.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,240
 Here's another example which might help you visualize it if you're having difficulty with the "why can't we find the original part of it?"

56
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,600
 It's like let's say that we had a band book.

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,200
 So I know the Anarchist Cookbook is sort of like questionable band, etc. Because it teaches how to make bombs and stuff, right?

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,920
 So the original copy of the Anarchist Cookbook probably was bound and an actual book and was probably on sale somewhere.

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,840
 But the contents of that book could be copied onto napkins, and those napkins could be passed around.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,360
 And at that point you're looking for a book, you're looking for a napkin.

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,440
 There was also some stuff about that. I don't remember exactly which culture it was.

62
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,640
 There was a lot of book burning in our history.

63
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,080
 We did a lot of book burning, but what they couldn't do is they couldn't get rid of the spoken word.

64
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,360
 So there are some cultures that survived their culture just on telling stories.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
 And again, you can't do that by looking for the original copy of a book.

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:18,480
 You have to do that by examining the knowledge that exists in every person's brain and then, I don't know, like lasering them in the face with some sort of like zappy brain laser similar to the thing from Men in Black, right?

67
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,240
 So that's what's going on here.

68
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,480
 Okay, so this entire office hours is going to be about hypothetical ways to deal with this. That's fine.

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:35,280
 Bigel asks, "Is there a way to get something to detect the change in locomotion module where it changes and record the users in the room?"

70
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,480
 Um, it's not really tied to a locomotion module.

71
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:49,120
 If you wanted to detect, because it does try and hide in the rules slot of the world, you could do like a children count of roles and detect when that changes.

72
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,080
 Oh, it's everywhere, I don't know where I land. You could do that.

73
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,000
 This is exactly the sort of thing that Hard Permissions is designed to cover.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So Hard Permissions is a very sort of intangible feature because of course, A) it doesn't exist, B) it's not been planned, and C) you know, stuff.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:20,280
 We could do something as, again, an example that's an idea. Remember ideas are not bad, they're just bad until they're proved, they're just ideas until they are proven bad or unsuitable.

76
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,400
 You could do something where each person is an isolated slot hierarchy from themselves.

77
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,480
 So they're still able to make guns and stuff work, but they're not able to sort of parent above an isolated slot.

78
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,480
 That could be an example of Hard Permissions that might help.

79
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:48,960
 An addition of one might be being able to configure a world where only certain users such as the host or people with admin permissions could parent to certain places such as the roles folder or the locomotion folder.

80
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:57,320
 I have many issues about the locomotion modules and how I hate people that just come into my world and install their own locomotion modules and start flapping around and stuff.

81
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 It's like, guys, it's a parkour map. Stop. Stop flying.

82
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:07,960
 I think we should call it by its name, which is something like Poop Emoji Poop Emoji. Poop Emoji Kissy Face Emoji.

83
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,160
 Good question, Biko.

84
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,760
 Yeah, so I have a balcony right now, I needed to clean it, so I bought a broom.

85
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:28,600
 But now the problem is, like, I need to add water, and I don't think it's acceptable to rain water down on my downstairs neighbors, so I'm not sure how to clean my balcony, other than grabbing a bucket and doing it sort of like military style.

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,320
 You know, where you're on your hands and knees with like a hand brush, because then I can kind of control where the water's going.

87
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,960
 Not with a toothbrush, though.

88
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:44,120
 Oh yeah, I think I just have to like pray that it rains sufficiently between now and when I lose the keys to this place. Yeah, cool.

89
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:53,840
 Yeah, I just don't think that'll be like good, because like what you're doing there is you're saying, Biko asked about power washing, like you're basically saying like, cool, I'm going to rain down poop water onto your balcony below me.

90
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,280
 Like imagine if like, there's seven floors in this building, so imagine if like the seventh floor apartment did that.

91
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,680
 Rain down poop water into six, which rain down poop water into five, four, three, two, one.

92
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,520
 First one on the first floor is just like, cool, poop water.

93
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,880
 Kind of happy the new place doesn't have a balcony for that reason, I never use the balcony.

94
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,880
 And that means like in the new place, the outside of the building, nothing to do with me.

95
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,640
 Feel free to, you know, sometimes they get window cleaners in that use ropes and sort of abseil down to clean them.

96
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,880
 But not my problem.

97
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,320
 They did that here a few times and they sent out notices.

98
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,440
 And the notices were like, we'll be cleaning the windows, there'll be abseiling down on ropes.

99
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,160
 And I forgot to read the notice or forgot, and I like wake up in the morning and there's like noises outside my like closed curtains and it's just like, oh, what's going on?

100
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,760
 But then you look out there and there's like a man like cleaning your window or a rope.

101
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,640
 Okay, we got it. We got a question.

102
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:57,240
 So Slink says, also, I've got any tips on handling and teaching 20 users in one go since tomorrow will be hectic for me.

103
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,880
 You got to like, you got to sort of instill a kind of classroom atmosphere in that, particularly if you've got like a lesson.

104
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,920
 So often people will not realize what they're in, like they're in a lesson.

105
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:19,080
 So you need to be very clear on sort of like how you can talk, when you can talk, you need to raise your hand, like, you know, how to make sure everyone understands, etc.

106
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,120
 I had a whole plan for like a lesson classroom world that's going to have a lot of tooling to sort of help with that stuff.

107
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
 I just never got around to building it.

108
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,440
 Hank asked, do I use mechanical keyboard?

109
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,200
 I do.

110
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,680
 Slink says also, thanks for fixing my bad code.

111
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,360
 Yeah, um, Zinker works on a plugin for Neos called Neos Plus and they have a launcher for that.

112
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,240
 And I noticed that the launcher was, um, Zinker was like, oh, yes, I use MVVM now.

113
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
 And I'm like, no, you don't.

114
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,000
 Here you go.

115
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:59,080
 Um, uh, MVVM is a architectural choice that, uh, um, you can go for when you're creating, um, an application in many, many application frameworks.

116
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,640
 And, uh, it takes a while to get your head around it.

117
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,320
 It's similar to MVC, which is the one I grew up using.

118
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:13,280
 Um, but yeah, I've noticed a lot of times with that particular area, um, just in general, sometimes people write more code than they need.

119
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,560
 Like I deleted, I don't know, like almost 40% of the launcher just by like changing a couple of things.

120
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,280
 Uh, Hack asked what my favorite switches.

121
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,960
 I don't know.

122
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,480
 Um, the problem that I have is I don't want keyboards lying around in my apartment because like, I just, I don't want more than one.

123
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,960
 So I never tried any other switch other than the one I have.

124
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,280
 I don't even know what I want to have.

125
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,160
 In fact, the last time I needed to understand the keyboard that I have, I had to go behind my couch and I fell over and almost died.

126
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:48,720
 It was like really scary back there because there was tons of boxes and stuff and I fell over and I couldn't get up and I was stuck there for like 20 minutes.

127
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,480
 I don't know why I just was, and it was really scary.

128
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,760
 So I will not be looking at my keyboard because there are even more boxes back there now.

129
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,680
 Um, uh, Beagle asks, did you, uh, did you mount your base stations in the wall?

130
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,640
 No, I have like light poles that you might see it like photography studios.

131
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:17,400
 It is sometimes like weird when a non VR person visits my apartment, they're just like, it looks like sort of like a CIA base or something here.

132
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,960
 Uh, what like the various people have said, sometimes they get like weirded out.

133
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,040
 They're like, are they cameras?

134
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,440
 And I'm like, nah, they're just like, you know, irradiating you in infrared.

135
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,120
 It's totally fine.

136
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,680
 Don't worry about it.

137
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:37,560
 Most of the time they're on blue mode as well, which means they're not actively irradiating, but you know, like 13, my mother was here like a month or so ago and I was in a VR

138
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,120
 meeting to do some science stuff.

139
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,440
 And, you know, I apologize that I couldn't reschedule the meeting.

140
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,680
 Um, so I said, you know, just sit out the way and if you interested, you can see what's going on on my monitor.

141
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,600
 Um, she got too close at one point and I punched her in the face.

142
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
 Oh, she was there.

143
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:01,240
 Oh, she, she, but at least she got to see the, you know, the entire irradiation stack, um, wearing away.

144
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,480
 Um, hack 13 asks, how many light, uh, light houses, base stations do you think is the right amount for good

145
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,920
 tracking?

146
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,200
 Two, but it does depend on your room.

147
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:18,720
 I have four because I'm in an open plan, um, living room, uh, kitchen set up and it means that there's lots of reflective stuff in the kitchen.

148
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,000
 So I use, um, I box it in with four and that has improved my tracking.

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,280
 I actually don't know if it has.

150
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,280
 I would say subjectively it's improved my tracking objectively.

151
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,040
 I have no idea, but yeah, normal users only really need two.

152
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:44,600
 If you're doing two, uh, do them opposite corners, one high, one low, obviously not too low and then you get like feet in the way and stuff, but like, you know, one really high aiming down one sort of more sort of head height, et cetera.

153
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,760
 You got, you go on, it's just like irradiate it, just irradiate your entire space with as much infrared as possible.

154
00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:02,120
 And just because it's coming to mention, I've seen a lot of people that don't like new headsets because they don't have base stations, like trust that in the future, your future virtual reality

155
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,920
 headsets will not need base stations and then trust in the technology.

156
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,280
 It's getting better and better every year.

157
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,040
 And I was like, but they didn't use base station, so I won't buy it.

158
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,200
 I'm like, okay, yeah, welcome to the year 2100.

159
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,680
 We've all got full dive VR, but because your full dive VR headset doesn't use base station, you're still not using it.

160
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,560
 Fantastic.

161
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
 See you in the metaverse, I guess.

162
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,040
 Um, anyway, um, yeah, there's no, there's no reason why base station should be like needed for the rest of time.

163
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,920
 I say the same as well to people who like complain about gestures all the time.

164
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:39,680
 Like there's no way in like a few years that you're going to be still making weird sort of gestures with your hands to try and smile and stuff inside VR.

165
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,960
 That's just, it's just not going to happen.

166
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:50,360
 Um, Hack13 asked, do you think, uh, the visual quality of the Vajaro, the Vajaro Aero is overkill for the average consumer?

167
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,600
 I've forgotten the Vajaro's price point, but it would all depend on what that price point is.

168
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
 So I can go look that up or someone can just type it.

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,600
 Yeah.

170
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,840
 Okay.

171
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,880
 2000 is too much.

172
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,080
 Bex talks about controllers not being trapped behind your back.

173
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,440
 Yep.

174
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,120
 That is true for some headsets right now, but you remember there's going to be some new tracking technology.

175
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,720
 I don't know what it is, but there's going to be some new tracking technology that just fixes everything eventually.

176
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,000
 And if anyone who says that isn't remember that when I was young, we had a Nokia 3310.

177
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:30,680
 And before that, my stepfather had a, um, had a phone that would disturb speakers and TV screens when it was near them because it was outputting so much radiation.

178
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,600
 It was this huge brick and it was just like a horrible.

179
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,640
 So yeah, that's what he used to do.

180
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,200
 And then only one generation prior, they only had black and white TV.

181
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,040
 And for some of their life, they had no TV.

182
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,760
 So just, you got to keep that in mind.

183
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,880
 Base stations for now. Agreed, but just be careful of being too rigid in your technology.

184
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,600
 Cause that's how you turn into an old person that is like, I don't know how this new technology works.

185
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,720
 You've got to stay up to date and transition through the technology.

186
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,240
 But there's still some 3d modelers.

187
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,520
 I know that haven't upgraded to blender 2.8 or whatever, whatever the weather UI went from gray to dark gray.

188
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,680
 They haven't upgraded.

189
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
 And they're just like, I just like where everything is.

190
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,640
 And it's like, okay, yeah.

191
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,040
 Let me know in like, you know, let me know in like 10 years where you're still on 2.7, everything's still slow.

192
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,960
 I can't use blender 2.7.

193
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,040
 Like, you know, the moment 2.8 or whatever it was came out, that was good.

194
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,880
 Amazing.

195
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,000
 The UI is so much worse in 2.7.

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,080
 Any more questions?

197
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,200
 Hack13 asks, what's the cheese of the day?

198
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,240
 I don't answer cheese questions.

199
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,840
 Next question.

200
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,360
 So we've got about six minutes left.

201
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,440
 So if you have any more questions, please drop them in the office hours text chat.

202
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,760
 I'll get them in the order that appear.

203
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,160
 Whilst there are no questions, we'll just sit here and think about cheese.

204
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:51,040
 Godly asks, has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like we can do move mountains?

205
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,960
 Hack13 asked about the best file format to import an avatar to an esvr that was exported from blender for the easier setup.

206
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,440
 I am 2023 is glTF gang.

207
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,600
 So glTF.

208
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,880
 I'll use Sulteo FBX.

209
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,680
 FBX is a proprietary format which hasn't been updated in a long time.

210
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,120
 And so I want to move to a more open format.

211
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:19,120
 So 2023 try using glTF provided you aren't using like weird formats such as OBJ or STL.

212
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,360
 You can't really go wrong.

213
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,760
 Like I've seen some avatars work in like DAE.

214
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,760
 I've seen some avatars work in really weird formats, but if you can, you might as well.

215
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,160
 GLTF is where we're going.

216
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,560
 Maddie says DAE.

217
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,760
 Sometimes DAE works.

218
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,560
 Sometimes it doesn't.

219
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,880
 Like I don't like DAE.

220
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,160
 Like I avoid DAE more than I avoid any other format.

221
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,360
 I don't know why.

222
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,640
 I just do.

223
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,440
 Beagle says is glTF nearly supported at university?

224
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,200
 I would say no.

225
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,640
 The problem is glTF is a standard and that means it's progressing.

226
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,600
 It's a little bit like the whole USB debacle that's going on right now.

227
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,960
 Different parts of the standard are supported by different applications.

228
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,080
 For anyone who doesn't know what I mean by USB debacle, USB-C was meant to be a standard that

229
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,680
 enabled everyone to move forward and just stop having a fun time with crazy connectors.

230
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,400
 But now there is USB-C, but there is a standard that no one follows.

231
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,280
 So sometimes C can only carry power.

232
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
 Sometimes it can carry power and data.

233
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,360
 Sometimes it can carry power, but only to a certain wattage.

234
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,800
 Sometimes it can't carry power at the USB-C wattage because it's a Chinese cable.

235
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,280
 Sometimes it can't carry all the data pins.

236
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,360
 Sometimes the pins aren't even soldered together.

237
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,400
 Sometimes just the power pins are soldered together.

238
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,360
 Sometimes just the pins that allow USB-2 data fees are soldered together.

239
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,480
 Sometimes there's bridged connections.

240
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,240
 Sometimes there's inverted connections.

241
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,680
 A bit like network cables where there's like all the cables and you compare them.

242
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,360
 Sometimes they're sort of swapped around inside a USB-C.

243
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,000
 People are doing stuff on top of USB-C.

244
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,240
 Like there's lots of cables that have microcontrollers in them.

245
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,680
 So they take the USB signal and do something to them in the middle of the cable.

246
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,280
 It's just a nightmare.

247
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,960
 Then there's USB-4, which doesn't really exist right now, but like some people are saying

248
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,840
 their USB-C cable, that's USB-3 is USB-4, sometimes it is actually USB-4.

249
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,240
 It's a nightmare.

250
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,640
 We've about a minute left, so if there are any additional Neos questions, please do get

251
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,520
 them in the office hours check chat or we will go ahead and close off things.

252
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
 Oh, thank you.

253
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,280
 I missed a question.

254
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,720
 Thank you.

255
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,880
 Lex says, what are good ways of mitigating floating point jitters for large worlds?

256
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,760
 I have an unconventional way of handling that, which I haven't seen mentioned a lot by other

257
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,760
 people, which is one of the problems with floating points is, well, the problem I explained

258
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,600
 floating points was for, if you start at 0, 0, 0 at your world spawn, which most worlds

259
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,720
 do, and you go out a certain distance, you'll start seeing jitters because floating point

260
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,800
 maths breaks down because we don't have enough digits of precision for that distance.

261
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,400
 But people never remember the fourth dimension is available to combat that.

262
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,080
 And some people are like, time?

263
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,720
 I'm like, no, no, no.

264
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,960
 In this case, scale.

265
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,200
 If you want a really large world, you could reduce the overall size of your world by, let's

266
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 say, by 10 on the scale axis, and therefore everything else will need to be positioned a

267
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,360
 shorter distance away.

268
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,400
 So if you have, I don't know, like if you have a one kilometer world that spans left to

269
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,960
 right and that's one kilometer at one, one, one scale, you maybe you'll hit floating point.

270
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,640
 I don't know the exact numbers is, but maybe you will.

271
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,480
 But you could shrink that world by 10 percent of the scale, shrink all users by 10 percent of

272
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,960
 the scale.

273
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
 And then suddenly you've got a much more manageable world.

274
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,560
 Of course, there's a limit where you start having compounds where you compound the

275
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:38,560
 floating point issues on the scale axis as well as the coordinate axis.

276
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,680
 Matty says scale only works if users aren't overwriting their scale.

277
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,640
 If users are overwriting their scale, they are idiots and they should leave your world.

278
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,800
 Just saying, I get like really grumpy on people doing bad stuff to their users because

279
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,880
 they're like, oh, I always want to be one scale no matter what's going on.

280
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,560
 It's just like, hey, well, get out of my world then.

281
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,520
 Bigel talks about scaling the world route.

282
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,880
 I don't advise scaling the world route because the route is like the special handling on the

283
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,040
 route.

284
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,640
 Please don't scale the world route.

285
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,000
 There's other people that like, I always want to be parented to the world route.

286
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,080
 I'm just like, well, get out of my world then.

287
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,000
 Specs says I have to fiddle with my scale to be actual height of the character inhabit as an

288
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,480
 avatar.

289
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,080
 You should be using height compensation or default user scale to do that.

290
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
 You shouldn't be using the actual user scale.

291
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,120
 Default user scale would be compatible with what I'm talking about.

292
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,480
 Damn it.

293
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,400
 Specs says, but I have to toggle to be one to one for times when I'm building.

294
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
 Yeah, if you're building, it's fine, right?

295
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,360
 If you're building, you do whatever the hell scale you need to be.

296
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,960
 If you're not building, then please honor the world settings.

297
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,600
 Please honor the world settings when it comes to scale.

298
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,320
 You can be small and big and stuff like that.

299
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,760
 Yeah, I get that stuff, but like, you know, do it using the appropriate components and stuff.

300
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,120
 If the world parrots you to somewhere, don't reparent yourself to route.

301
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,520
 Just like get over.

302
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:56,800
 Yeah.

303
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,360
 Yeah.

304
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,800
 World parenting will screw a lot of stuff.

305
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,800
 I have a page up on the Wiki called be considerate.

306
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,280
 Um, it is a grumpy phrased and grumpy toned page where I'm just like, just remember that

307
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,280
 you're a guest in the world and a guest in the session.

308
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,400
 And so you aren't entitled to as much stuff as you think you're entitled.

309
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,280
 Um, I don't see any additional questions.

310
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,480
 We are four minutes over.

311
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,320
 Oh, I do see an additional question.

312
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,120
 Thank you so much.

313
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,440
 This is on the ball.

314
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,280
 Um, Beagle says, can you make yourself a child of the route and make everything else a child of that?

315
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,160
 Yes, that's exactly what you know.

316
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
 You know, the user spawn has the parent option.

317
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,000
 You could do that.

318
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,840
 Although I don't suggest doing that if you're going to move your user spawn because then you're not moving everyone.

319
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,560
 That's always fun.

320
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,200
 Yeah.

321
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,800
 Think about it.

322
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,480
 Of course, like, you know, it's only one way of doing it.

323
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:50,040
 Um, but, um, other ways are like someone says is move the world, not the user, but like that gets really confusing and you have to like synchronize that.

324
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,640
 It's, it's weird.

325
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
 But yeah.

326
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
 Um, thumbs up.

327
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,320
 Um, I think that'll be it for today.

328
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,440
 So I'm gonna go ahead and leave off here and I will speak to all again soon.

329
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,360
 Please drop questions in the questions and help channel.

330
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,600
 If you have any additional new questions and I will speak to you again next week.

331
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,840
 Actually, let me just double check.

332
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,600
 Uh, yeah, we'll be fine.

333
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,880
 I was just double checking the move might interfere with the schedule.

334
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,200
 It won't next week and it went the week after because by the fourth I should be in anyway.

335
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,960
 Bye bye.
