00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 Welcome to office hours. We're gonna go ahead and get started. This is the weekly air-mayor section where I ask questions about Nios

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,980
 So if you have any questions about Nios, please drop them in the office hours text chat

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,380
 And I will go ahead and get them answered

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,240
 I'm just gonna go ahead and ping the office hours roll again so people know that we're here

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,380
 It does take people like I don't know ten minutes to arrive. It's like seven people right now

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,280
 Thank you so much those seven people for being here. We get to like 20 past. It's like 20 people. It's strange

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,840
 But there we go

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,560
 Try to keep this at the same time every single week for as long as possible

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,860
 Just so people think of it like a TV show. So we have one question right now from specs this question

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,080
 I'm going to delay reading just for a little bit whilst I open up the code base

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,320
 Excuse me. Oh, it's because I checked out a branch yesterday

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,120
 I tried to open Visual Studio Visual Studio and can't find that solution file. It's like oh, yeah, I'm on a branch one second

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,960
 I'll read the question whilst the code base is loading that takes a while anyone who's opened a Visual Studio project, you know

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,840
 It's just like oh, yes

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,600
 I'm gonna spin your computer fans up as loud as they will go just to read some text files because that's Visual Studio for you

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,440
 So specs this question is

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,740
 Do wigglers or and wobblers and other components that run on T incur much in the way of network traffic or do they basically run locally?

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,720
 Masking from matter how much how many might be too many in a world surprised to find how many we could sit you without seeing

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,080
 Which impact so I know that spinner for example runs locally and that's why

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,960
 Spinners can actually desync for various people

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,720
 So spinners are really only good for what I call sort of visual animations rather than sort of functional animations

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,580
 What I mean by that is let's say you're in a wizard study as a part of an RPG game

23
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,400
 And there's one of those like mobile, you know small planetariums in the corner

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,780
 If those planets on that planetarium are running on a spinner, that's probably okay, right?

25
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,760
 Because it's just there to add ambience to the to the scene. It's not there to

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:03,560
 Do anything functional so you people being desync is totally fine with that. It's just a you know background piece of art

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:11,920
 If however that wasn't a planetarium and instead it was actually like a solar system and you're making a space game where you fly between

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,240
 Planets using a spaceship you wouldn't be able to use spinner in that case because the planet might be in a completely different

29
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,520
 Location for half the crew of your ship which would kind of be a deal breaker

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,820
 So there you go. There's the difference on spinner at least now the code base is open and responding to control T requests

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
 I can go ahead and look at wobbler

32
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,920
 Yeah, so wobble is also local so local drive

33
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,400
 And the same with wiggler. We'll go wiggle and wobble

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,720
 Almost said what what what would too many w words wobble and wiggle do not sync any data

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,460
 Other than their settings if you change the speed the magnitude etc those will sync

36
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,240
 The actual state does not sync so again

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,980
 they are used for local effects like I mentioned the difference between the model planetarium and a wizard's office and the

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,540
 Space game where you're flying between planets, and that's why you can get away with quite a lot of them

39
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,160
 But do you remember that they don't sync?

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,220
 Moving forwards to the next question has been difficult to manage the development of multiple versions of Nia since you've said in the past you

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,000
 Have quite a few things were pretty much ready for an update and there's also small update required like the one we had

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
 But they score is it difficult to track all that considering how large the project is it get get is very good at that

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,180
 In some cases get isn't like I just had

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,560
 I don't know why but because I had a branch checked out the shortcut file

45
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,760
 I usually used to launch the solution didn't work for some reason

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,800
 Occasionally I have to remake that shortcut file. I don't really understand why but whatever

47
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,620
 Other than that it's good. There are some cases where like mergers are problematic a good example of this that has been in public before so

48
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,900
 It's you know

49
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,200
 Do you know about it already is color management in color management?

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,400
 We introduced a new data type color X which I believe you can still see inside Neos right now. It's just not finished

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
 Don't use it. Don't use it

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,440
 But it's there inside the code base

53
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:08,280
 When we are trying to make the full cut over to color management every version of color in our code base

54
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
 needs to turn to color X

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,000
 And so while that is only a one character change just imagine everywhere

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,920
 Why color is used as a good example there the delete button the default inspector is red and the reason why it's red is

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,500
 Because someone has typed the word color dot red at some point in the code base that needs to be color X dot red

58
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,820
 And so what that leads to sometimes is a lot of merge conflicts particularly when?

59
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:38,180
 You know the color management build is is you know trying to desperately stay up to date with anything else for the video

60
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,640
 It's that question, but get pick is designed to be there. I'm still trying to teach members of the team

61
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
 How get works etc for example?

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,020
 If you are one of the people who commits to get with the git commit message of update I will

63
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,260
 Do the leader Liam?

64
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,140
 Who's the guy that plays the wanted guy?

65
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:04,360
 No, no that's wanted the movie of bending bullets

66
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,660
 I want the one I was a new one he played memory Liam Neeson. Yeah, Liam Neeson

67
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,780
 You know he plays the same person in every single film. He's the guy who gets stuff done

68
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,300
 Taken is the film that I was

69
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,020
 Referring to that's the mean

70
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,640
 Yeah, so if you

71
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,940
 Get commits that was it yeah, if you use git commits with just a simple of like update

72
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,480
 I will find you and I will kill you

73
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,080
 Git commit should describe the change there is no such thing as a

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,900
 Too long and get commit you should keep the first line of the git commit very short

75
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,820
 But you can push enter and then type an essay and git will just handle it

76
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,600
 It's beautiful when you do that because people have context about why you made that change

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,560
 And then you don't do something like at 3 a.m.. Go why did

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
 Bob who isn't at work today because they're on vacation

79
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,000
 Why did he make this change because it just broke everything sure you doing that and then secondarily don't commit commented out code

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,960
 You need to comment something out, and you think you might use it later

81
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,820
 you should wrap it in a configuration block or a build flag or you should delete it and

82
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,940
 Leave a reference somewhere in your own personal notes about where you can find it in the git tree if you don't have personal notes

83
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,380
 Without your code then I don't know what you doing

84
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,140
 I just like keep notes for everything like I was setting up the MMC voting server for this year

85
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,900
 And I had no idea how it worked

86
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,220
 I completely forgot everything because I didn't make notes so I have made notes and I know how it works

87
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,420
 And I'll know how it works next year. Oh, it's an interesting question

88
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,020
 They say what is a part of Neos that you wish you understood better?

89
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:50,040
 I understood the actual like lower level data stuff the synchronization for anyone who's written a plug-in or a mod

90
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,720
 Maybe you'll understand that the majority of fields that do synchronize in Neos are just called what are called sinks

91
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,140
 Sink and then not sink the kitchen sink sinkers in to sink synchronize

92
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,880
 if you make something a sink it will just

93
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,380
 Magically appear on everyone's computer, and I have no real idea how or why because I don't really need to touch it

94
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,640
 I wish understood that more simply because if there are problems of it

95
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,160
 Which there are I could go ahead and fix them if that questions answered moving forwards to Riggs question

96
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,700
 Riggs says well the new Neos have

97
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 Different collision physics than the current build asks because I'm trying to make a pool of table

98
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,260
 I don't know what you mean by a new Neos, so we do have an item on our roadmap

99
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,060
 rigid body physics and rigid body physics will enable you to

100
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:45,380
 Make things like a pool table that isn't spotted right now. It's not like a physics system or anything to do with collisions

101
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,320
 It's just an unsupported feature. Yes

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,280
 You'll be able to do stuff like that in fact a pool table is actually like a really good example of the difference between

103
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,920
 Rigid body physics and what we currently have what we currently have is character physics

104
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,400
 Which is hey I can jump in the world and I don't fall through the floor

105
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,040
 Which you can sort of coerce into making balls and stuff that you can throw around

106
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:11,640
 But it's difficult laggy etc. And there's a huge warning when you do that like literally built into the inspector

107
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
 That won't be the case when we have rigid body physics if you like more information on rigid body physics

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,440
 Take a look at the character controller component inside the game

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,760
 Which has a list of you know talks all about it or take a look at the issue

110
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,380
 Which is reference from that character controller component or just search for rigid body physics

111
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,480
 Okay, moving forwards to Lex's question. What is the timeout for certain network related actions for example?

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,860
 How long it takes to automatically get set offline when you crash or how long it takes for a session to disappear off the session

113
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,120
 This one you crash. I'd have to look up each of those in turn

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
 Because they're they're probably different

115
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,980
 Some of them might just be sort of a function of other matters as well. For example the session lister

116
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,620
 I know that that has a couple of update mechanisms

117
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,140
 So there's the update mechanism that occurs on our end as in the cloud and then there's the update mechanism that happens

118
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,360
 on your end, which is periodically your world browser will

119
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,540
 Ask the server for new sessions, and so if those don't sync up exactly like a sort of weird orchestra

120
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,860
 Then things that aren't valid might be there. The breaking questions

121
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,620
 I'm going to mute and slurp and humongous amount of coffee. Okay, that was half a pint of coffee

122
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,100
 I should be good to go now. Why are there two threads? Oh someone speaking the thread from February

123
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,520
 Let's go ahead and lock that thread. I will answer the question. It's our fault if it's confusing, but I'll go ahead and lock that one

124
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,500
 So Rico says will near support non humanoid avatars from the VR chat depends what you mean by non humanoid

125
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,420
 I think that due to a certain population on our platform will probably look into

126
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,120
 different leg types at some point

127
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,300
 If you mean things like spiders quadrupeds

128
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,820
 Any millipedes probably not millipedes, but you know well

129
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,660
 I think you're probably asking there for is more generic IK which is a feature that we're interested in

130
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:08,980
 So for those who aren't aware IK and also FK aren't just things are used for avatars or

131
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,200
 You know moving arms or whatever inside of

132
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,880
 In you know inside video games they're used for the actual fully definite process of those

133
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,700
 Which is inverse kinematics or forward kinematics if you don't understand what kinematics are

134
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,500
 I want you to think about the cup of water glass soda, whatever it is on your desk that you're drinking

135
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,540
 Hopefully you've got a drink on your desk and what you think about you picking up and drinking them the fact that your body

136
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:41,060
 Knows the sequence of muscles to pull and push to make that happen

137
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,180
 automatically is

138
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,180
 Forward kinematics that's like where you you know where stuff needs to be and so you you know

139
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,380
 Just you adjust stuff until it works that way so it comes up in a lot of stuff

140
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,060
 It comes up in a good example being of like generic IK would be like a robot arm

141
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,520
 So you think about a factory where robot arms may be?

142
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,500
 Lifting a piece into place someone I always think about as a car manufacturing line

143
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,860
 You know when they take like half the car and this robot arm goes like

144
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,340
 Like sucks it to the other side of the car yeah that needs kinematics

145
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,080
 So you know where the robot arm is in space that the human body just knows that is is amazing

146
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
 We don't really understand how it works

147
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,540
 Everyone's now sort of waving their arms around and thinking about it next question here from Ozi who says

148
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,620
 Not sure how to phrase this right, but how odd is the facial tracking implementation for Nia's?

149
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,700
 It seems like the facial tracking software is well buggy horrible and annoying so imagine for Nia's is trying its best

150
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,900
 You have to remember that do everything through a layer

151
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,420
 so we do

152
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,660
 Device integration, and then we do what we sort of like

153
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,080
 I don't know if it's literally called this but in my head like sanitization and conversion

154
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,540
 So we take the data that the device gives us we sanitize it and we convert it into data which Nia's

155
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,300
 Understands and then we blast it out there in Nia's functionality

156
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,400
 And that's the biggest example of this that doesn't actually make sense to be integrated

157
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,460
 But is integrated right now is that for haptic systems?

158
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:12,200
 We support both the be haptic suit and the oboe suit if anyone who doesn't know what the o suit is good

159
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,360
 It's a alternative haptic base suit which requires sticky gel to be affixed to your skin via a tight jacket

160
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,260
 It looks interesting

161
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,940
 But I don't know if I want to get naked and sticky with the lads just to have some haptic feedback

162
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,200
 The point there being both of those systems work and have vastly different API's

163
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,620
 But they come out the same as the haptic components inside of Nia's

164
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,300
 We want to make that sort of first part like the device integration layer

165
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,880
 We want to make that open to you guys to write plugins is the wrong word because everyone goes like but then I can't join other

166
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,100
 People we want to make it so you can join other people and you'll be able to write your own device integrators

167
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
 So if you make a headset in your bedroom

168
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,560
 using a workbench and you know an Arduino ever you'd be able to

169
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:06,760
 Integrate it into our systems and it would pretend from the view of other people in the session that you are just wearing a regular

170
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,400
 Headset because that would stop the sort of arms race. It's not arms race is the wrong word

171
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,720
 But you know, I mean like we have when a new device comes out

172
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,780
 Well, I mean my arms race which is the wrong word, but I'll run with it is that you know

173
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,440
 New headset comes out does VR chat support it does

174
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:29,400
 Rec room support it does roblox support it does meta horizon support it does neo support it and the answer to those questions is

175
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,960
 the first person to support it usually gets like a

176
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,440
 Boost because they're like, yeah, we support it blah blah blah

177
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
 moving on to additional questions

178
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,280
 Alex says what did I miss what you can do the recording?

179
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,920
 There's also a transcription available which does stress out my computer, which is why it sometimes takes a while

180
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,960
 It's like ah VR platform developer is slow on AI thing. Yay

181
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,480
 I need like more computers

182
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,500
 I know that it's the stereotypical thing for people who work in the tech sector like me in this area to have like server racks in

183
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,480
 Their houses or something so many people I know have just got like a full server rack in their house

184
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,600
 And they're just like, oh, yes, I could process this transcription through my server rack. I don't I used to it's off

185
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600
 It's the tree. It's been I shipped it from the UK where I lived

186
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,080
 To Germany where I live for 18 months

187
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,600
 I didn't turn it on and then I shipped it to America and I still haven't got it turned on

188
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,000
 There's actually still packing tape on it from when I moved in here five years ago

189
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,960
 It's not even really a server. It's just a tiny box that can do what I want to

190
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,720
 But yeah, there will be a transcription and there will be a recording

191
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,020
 Alex then extends this question with talked about Nia's future. We have not talked about Nia's future

192
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,380
 If you like to ask a question, please go ahead and do so moving on to the next question

193
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,000
 Riggs says full body locking to hip or head feature possibly on the horizon. I'm used this might be a thing

194
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,280
 I seem to be hip-locked

195
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,760
 Ah, yeah

196
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,960
 So there is a large collection of issues to do with IK particularly when it comes to full body tracking

197
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,220
 That we want to look at and improve. Frix is quite sure of what he needs to do there, though

198
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,020
 He just needs to you know, have the time and capability to do it. He spends a lot of time in full body understanding

199
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,600
 What's going on there?

200
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,660
 We get it's problematic. We're just there's nothing we can do about it right now. There's a bunch of changes there

201
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,640
 Erin asked what's the difference between forward and inverse kinematics?

202
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:22,600
 I've had a forward kinematics before so inverse is you take the end position and you figure out the joints going backwards

203
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,980
 So in the case of a robot arm, you would take the position of the clasper

204
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,380
 You know the grabby bit at the end of the arm and you would work backwards from the grabber to figure out

205
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,120
 Where the joints of the arm need to be to make sure that that grabber is there?

206
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,840
 Whereas forward kinematics is the other way around you start at the top and you are down

207
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,620
 I don't know much about it, but I presume like inverse is more

208
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,500
 Easy to wrap your head around because you're like, yeah

209
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,840
 I want I want the grasp or of my arm to be here

210
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,480
 Work out where the elbow needs to be work out where the shoulder needs to be

211
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,360
 And that is I don't know because we don't know what mathematics our brains are running

212
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,160
 But I believe that's kind of sort of how our brains interpret it as well

213
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,240
 Like I don't ever think about my shoulder or my elbow and I reach out and grab my giant mug of coffee

214
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,660
 I just grab my giant mug of coffee because that's where I want my hand to be

215
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,760
 So I believe that's that question

216
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,920
 Moving forwards to Rico's question Rico says will there be more features to make easier to create things for desktop users?

217
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,460
 Depends what you mean there if you could elaborate on what difficulties were having as a desktop user

218
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,480
 I might be able to answer you more effectively Aaron asks. Is there a question you're surprised?

219
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
 Nobody has been asking an office hours yet

220
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,260
 I'm always curious about sort of like some of the weirder parts of news that no one seems to use

221
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,120
 I would love to answer questions about the areas which I use

222
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,020
 every day that no one else uses like let's get some more questions about the

223
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,380
 3d volumes

224
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,500
 Slices the measure tip the meter tip the distance meter component

225
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,760
 You know more questions like that like if I haven't heard of the component and you ask about it

226
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,220
 You should get like a badge you get like oh my god prime hasn't heard of this component badge

227
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,500
 Alex you can watch the recording. I

228
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,100
 Can't continually repeat myself. It's it's like we run on into the future

229
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,640
 Ozzy says there was a new tip added to initial tools recently. What's that intended? It was intended

230
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,680
 I did it and I don't really like I don't care what anyone thinks what I did was I took the mesh visibility

231
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:26,840
 Tooltip and I made it visible inside essential tools. It was completely invisible. I also updated the

232
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,440
 this visual for the

233
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,140
 component clone tip so that you can actually see it's the yellow one because again like the picture like I basically just

234
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,880
 updated the pictures because it was bothering me the

235
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,520
 Three people in that week had asked about the mesh visibility tip and I'm like, it's there

236
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,600
 It's just the invisible one and I'm like hang on a minute. Why can't I just update this and I'm like I can so I did

237
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,000
 I understand that that breaks muscle memory. There's nothing I can do about that

238
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,200
 I think it's better in the long run that the mesh visibility tip is now actually visible

239
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
 I just found it ridiculous

240
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,020
 like and then someone needed the component clone tip and they didn't realize that that was the component clone tip because again it was you

241
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,360
 Know the picture was very small. What I'd love us to do is get

242
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,380
 You know probably get some like good UI

243
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,760
 not designers illustrators would be the appropriate term for this particular task to make

244
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,440
 Diagrams and pictures for each tool that we would then replace in the inventory

245
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,720
 Rather than a picture of the tool tip

246
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,560
 It would be like a square with the word developer tip and then a picture of the developer tip

247
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,120
 you know like a billboard ad sort of I just think that'd be a lot clearer and better than

248
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:44,960
 An often weirdly stretched blurry photo that you can only really tell which tip it is by the color. So

249
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,640
 To summarize I guess it is not a new tip. I just updated it so you can see it

250
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
 If anyone has a problem with that

251
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,920
 I will turn invisible and you won't be able to find me

252
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:03,160
 Just like the mesh visibility tip which is designed to make stuff invisible, but itself was invisible very confusing

253
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:10,360
 Alex's where is the recording the recording will be up between one and seven days from the time of this

254
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,880
 Session it really does depend on what I need to do immediately following this if I get distracted

255
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,960
 It's suddenly midnight and I haven't done it which then means it's Wednesday and I haven't done it

256
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,960
 And then if I have way too much like 3d graphic stuff to do on Wednesday

257
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,840
 I just can't I can't run the eye. Rusio says has prime heard of the linear map of 3d or

258
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,280
 We're just gonna like test me out. Like do I know these components?

259
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,080
 The reason why I'm delaying is because I'm actually going to my youtube channel because I think I have a video on the linear mappers

260
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,520
 Yeah, I do 31st October 2019, yeah, I know about the linear mappers

261
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,720
 Moving forwards to stifle says I wonder if prime has heard of the lapping multi clip player before. Yes

262
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,960
 I have someone was asking about that misunderstanding what was going on. There's one of those that is broken

263
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,560
 One of the clip players is broken. I can't remember which one is broken. I need to look at both of their names

264
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,840
 I'm in Neo, so I'll just empty object attach component media and see if I can find it

265
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,260
 It's in players. It's an audio then. Yeah, there's the lapping multi clip player and the multi audio clip player

266
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,480
 And one of those is broken. There was an issue I was reading about moving forwards

267
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,460
 Rusio said that they assumed it would be invisible like an in joke. I don't agree of in jokes the hamper

268
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,380
 Uses freedom like an in joke is totally fine. For example

269
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,520
 Really don't know of a good example

270
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,360
 I guess the example is when you like, you know

271
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,500
 I mean in the bottom left of discord when you click like the area that's got your your doobly-doo your numbers on it

272
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,460
 You can copy actually that's changed recently because now it just brings up that used to be that when you click that it would copy

273
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,900
 It to clipboard and if you clicked it like a few times like there'd be a little white to die like the elephant

274
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:58,240
 Logo person would not the logo one but the one that they animate sometimes would come up and go to die or something

275
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
 That's that's a fun joke

276
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,240
 Something that like is a detriment to uses is not a fun joke though. Oh, yeah, Sasha

277
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:12,140
 I do want to ask why is the clear logics interface but icon in there called clear logics which ends born actually called clear

278
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,360
 Interfaces no actual confused problem. Just confused me and how that desync. I don't know how that desync either

279
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,860
 I'd have to look into it. Maybe they did the picture thing

280
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,180
 You can customize inventory thumbnails and maybe they customize the inventory thumbnail for it

281
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,000
 But just didn't update the thumbnail being forwards Tiki says there's the new neat say the MMC 23 map

282
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,280
 When I play it, I find myself missing blocks if I never actually see the saber inside the block

283
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,760
 Especially when the framerate is low. Do you think it'd be possible to make more efficient block hit detection using logics?

284
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,280
 Just to know if colliders the most efficient solution to the already

285
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,120
 Colliders should be the most efficient solution. I've had people before

286
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,920
 That have said something on the lines of like but my logic's collision code is better and I've come like do you have any idea?

287
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,800
 What you're saying?

288
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,280
 Inside the physics engine that we use to do collisions is

289
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,720
 Awesome. Awesome code that you just can't do like overlaps

290
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,960
 Intersections all that sort of like terminology for the physics and that's how it works out whether to colliders are colliding and that's how it works

291
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,760
 Out if mesh colliders are colliding it's like it's insane. It's examining each individual triangle and seeing if it overlaps of another triangle

292
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,440
 It's crazy. You can't do some of that in logic, but not all of it

293
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,200
 I've had someone literally say that they were going to take their object and sort of surround it in

294
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,880
 Ray cast a little bit like pinhead from Hellraiser to try and see if it's colliding in anything and I'm like

295
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,160
 Could you not just put an active collider on it?

296
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,520
 And I heard active colliders were bad and I said yeah, but what you're suggesting is much worse

297
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,120
 Active colliders are not bad by the way

298
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,380
 You just need to use them carefully spec says on that note if you're working with a team

299
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,640
 Please don't name your slots after memes instead of meaningful descriptions working with a team is an interesting

300
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,060
 Exploration and I'm happy to see that there are you know some standard teams that always come out MSC and do a really good job

301
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,340
 but I'm also happy to see as well that there are a lot of people who maybe haven't worked in a team before and are

302
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,760
 learning the

303
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,680
 quirks of doing that there is a lot of stuff that goes into there for anyone who doesn't know by

304
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,920
 By trade is wrong because I don't actually do it right now, but I spent

305
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,840
 Five six years as an engineer, and I've spent five or six years as a product manager

306
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,440
 I didn't understand what a product manager did but now I do

307
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,240
 People often get that role confused as well because a couple word manager and

308
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,400
 Manager has sort of connotations of being sort of like a leader or in charge or a boss in quotes

309
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,600
 When it comes to product manager, it's anything but our job is basically to orchestrate chaos

310
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,680
 And and that's what we do if you're a people manager. That's the traditional management thing that guys are

311
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:54,300
 Afraid of or apprehensive about if you're a product manager your job is to manage the product don't manage people so it's different

312
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,640
 Lex looked up. Yep. It's a custom thumbnail

313
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,560
 Item texture thumbnail source, I don't think has been renamed I can check for you. I go here

314
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,420
 I can go to item texture thumbnail source

315
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,360
 Looks like it used to be called texture thumbnail source. I don't know if that was before or after I made a video on it

316
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,820
 So I will check my channel make sure that's up to date item

317
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,880
 customize

318
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,100
 inventory

319
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,360
 Customize inventory thumbnails, let's see what I call it

320
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,480
 Oh

321
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,960
 Dear this is a three minute video run this at five times speed. I am running it faster than YouTube can keep up

322
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,440
 Give me a second here YouTube buffer the video

323
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,460
 Okay, I'll leave that buffering for a bit. I'll see if my tutorials up to that

324
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,680
 There are some frame synchronization issues for physics, which I think we're planning on looking at later. Thanks. Hey, look

325
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,920
 so the update was

326
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,960
 September 20th, and I did this

327
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,080
 Wish here September 20th 2021. Yeah, my videos are date. That's fine

328
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,400
 When we when we get going again with updates, I'll

329
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,380
 Start having some sort of policy on how I update videos and stuff

330
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,920
 I have a lot of people that comment on my world creation video and they're like this is all day

331
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,480
 I understand that the - is different but like if you just ignored the - everything's still valid

332
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,680
 Think says now that's where you trust on users to understand the names of the UI same but different UI homeless

333
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,400
 Wanna step by step holding the hand the exact same, you know, yeah, you are right and I've always said this

334
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
 I'm just you know reset it we are at time, but I'll restate it

335
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,200
 Anyone is free to make Neos tutorial videos and at some point I do hope that the Neos team themselves

336
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,920
 make

337
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,520
 Their own tutorials at which point they will be much better orchestrated planned and scripted

338
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,140
 You know, I'll probably be involved in those etc

339
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:48,120
 The the reason why my channel exists is to do tutorials in my style and my brand which is just like I hit go and I

340
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,280
 Record none of my videos are planned actually a couple of them are planned

341
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,820
 But like they still aren't planned when I hit there's no script

342
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,420
 The one where I did mineable or for example, that one was planned

343
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,440
 I had to go get some assets for that one, etc

344
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,800
 But I hit go and I just started talking I didn't have any script in mind. It's working out great

345
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,640
 Hence why everyone likes them, but there is a point in

346
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,600
 Neos's future I hope where my tutorials are sin as

347
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,560
 Less good because they are not scripted and that's absolutely fine

348
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,880
 And I like that day whenever that day happens

349
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,800
 I can we take a look at just a popular tutorial channel for a very popular topic, you know

350
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,640
 Maybe web development or something those people they plan and script so so so much

351
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:42,580
 To get the best quality video and then I'm just there like record giggle. Stop recording start recording again giggle

352
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,640
 Yeah, I don't like editing if I have to edit it would take me longer to learn to edit than it would to

353
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,260
 Just rerecord it. Well, there's been a couple of times where I've accidentally leaked like personal information or something

354
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,420
 You know what happens with OBS and I've gone I'll have to edit that out and blur it

355
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,840
 I've gone or I could just rerecord it and that'll take me ten minutes

356
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,020
 But I just rerecord it take a look at the outtakes video if you'd like to see some of those outtakes

357
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,560
 there are hundreds of exactly the same thing there Jackal says that the tutorials appealed to them because

358
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,000
 They're not polished. Yeah, I know it's exactly why I keep doing them

359
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,320
 I do need to I've got this idea for a meme video where I do a mock

360
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,440
 Video in the star everyone else does tutorials. We're gonna have dubstep. We're gonna have intros

361
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,960
 We have like a subscriber met thing would have the bell up here

362
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,640
 We're gonna have a raid shadow legend sponsor and it's gonna be a very simple tutorial

363
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,000
 It's gonna be like how to click a button in Neos like

364
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,400
 20 minutes with just like a single like second of left click. I should also you're right

365
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,680
 I should also do a hyper cam video. That would be great. I couldn't actually do raid shadow legends

366
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,760
 I I put ready to add a legend through the thesaurus and I came up with a very close title

367
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,260
 Which I'll make up and trust me that the sponsorship segment will have like a dragon downloaded from sketch fair

368
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,120
 But like reading and stuff, it'll be awesome. Okay, we have one final question

369
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,480
 I was just about to end but Zach did ask a question says how do I set up a dove dev tooltip again?

370
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,820
 You attach the dev to totally

371
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,680
 You attach the dev

372
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,440
 Tooltip component and everything will just work I can get you the name of that that component. Give me a second

373
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,840
 No, that's the logic step dev tooltip. There you go. Yeah, the actual whole part of the video will take

374
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,000
 300 times longer than the actual tutorial content of the video, which is just how to click a button

375
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,040
 So but that's the kind of the point

376
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,800
 Anyway with that we are at time we've been at time for like 10 minutes

377
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,840
 I will go ahead and leave us off here if you have any additional questions in the tight in the meantime

378
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,280
 Drop them questions and help channel DM me. Send me a carrier pigeon

379
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:53,080
 Whatever you want to do. I will get back to you with another office hours in a week. I will speak to them

380
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,580
 Bye bye.
