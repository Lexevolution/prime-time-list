00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 Welcome to office hours with prime if you go ahead and get your questions in the office hours thread for questions

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,320
 We'll get them answered in the order that they appear there are currently no questions

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,080
 So we're gonna sit here in unimaginable silence until there are questions

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,420
 For those who you who are just joining and don't know what this is. This is in half hour sometimes 45 minutes

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,600
 Sometimes an hour depends how distracted I get

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,920
 segment where you can ask questions about Neos and I will answer them whilst inevitably rambling about other things not to do of Neos such as

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,640
 Prime's magical journey through this world that we live in so feel free to get your questions in until then

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,320
 No noise will occur from my mouth runtime asks, can you turn the elevator music back on?

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,440
 I didn't know that that was my responsibility. I think you can turn it back on

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,040
 The waiting room at least you can't turn it back on whilst the the stage has been started as far as more weather

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,120
 There we go our first Neos question fantastic

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,320
 We have a question here from Lou Xanth who says is is there a way to change where a dev tip spawns an inspector?

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,300
 I do not think so, but in the effort of completeness, I'm gonna go ahead and open up the code base

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,720
 Which I haven't done today

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,120
 And I will load into that piece of the code as soon as I can and give you another answer

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,960
 As far as I remember what it does is it will raycast in front of you to find unoccupied space and put it in there

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,040
 for the

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,960
 Logics tip there's actually a better alternative there

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,160
 Which I've seen a lot of people to Ray V was I think the first person I saw who did it

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,980
 But now a lot of more people do it

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,480
 Where they attach a logics panel to their wrist and then they can pull nodes out of that

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,440
 It means they never close or open the logics panel. It's just always there

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,400
 Which which seems to work out better for them. It sort of reminds me of the flap

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,560
 That's on Buzz Lightyear's arm. I know that's just a sticker under there

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,020
 But like, you know, it could be it could be the logic sim on you. That's like a weird thing

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,840
 It's like Ray V's arm reminds me of Buzz Lightyear's arm. There you go, and that can go in quotes

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,560
 Alright code is loaded. I don't know if it's gonna respond to control T requests, but we'll see control T is

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,880
 Like the way to like just search through everything in a code base in C sharp

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,640
 so if I do like control T I type dev tool tip in I get to the source code for the dev tool tip, but

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,200
 If the code base isn't fully finished initializing into official studio

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,560
 Sometimes that just won't work. So I have to like wait and be like hmm

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,000
 Control T. Are you going to work today or you're not going to work today and it is it is working today

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,480
 interesting

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,520
 Code here. I haven't read ever. Oh

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,400
 Here we are open inspector. Oh

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,100
 Cool open inspector cool

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,220
 To do create inspector. Okay and create inspector will do oh, yeah

38
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,080
 Okay, so it just creates an inspector and then it will

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,360
 Position the inspector in front of you using a very common function that of course you don't know which can't be the source code

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,520
 called

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,480
 position in front of user where position in front of user will

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,240
 Interesting

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,360
 Interesting. Oh, no that only runs in user space. Okay, cool. All right

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,480
 Yeah, okay, so it just gets a point in front of the user get point in front of these

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,080
 It is exactly what I said it just raycast in front

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,760
 Looks at that distance and then positions it so no you can't control it

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,000
 The interesting thing was some special case handling for user space that doesn't really make sense and doesn't isn't needed

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,040
 So I mean is needed of course, but like it's not part of the question

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,120
 It just I read it confusingly because it made it sense

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,080
 Like it made sense to like that wasn't running in user space. It would have been interesting, but it's running

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,720
 Same with the logic node it will just do exactly the same thing unfortunately with the logic tip buzz light your wristwatch

52
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 Yeah buzz light your wristwatch

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,880
 Moving onwards to specs this question

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,160
 Do you have any documentation on building your ex it could be overwhelming to try and build interfaces with since the required?

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,120
 Components are not immediately intuitive nor is the fact that the hierarchy matters a lot more than things

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,360
 There is a 13 part YouTube tutorial series on a certain person's YouTube channel about uax development

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,480
 Might have heard of him that is to need like large-scale documentation. I know of that system though. It's also 13 parts

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,960
 I've actually heard of people saying I don't want to learn new x because prime tutorial series on is 13 parts

59
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:23,000
 Or I can't be bothered to watch 13 parts, and it's just like I don't know what you want from me like I make video tutorials

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,440
 Yeah, yeah, thank you for some enthusiasm on it. There is a lot of stuff there

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,080
 I don't know if all of its helpful or for it'll make sense because there is like an awful lot

62
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
 I try and go through

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,480
 In sort of a logical fashion

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,280
 Where we don't we don't cover layouts until it looks like part 10

65
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,680
 What I would encourage people to do is just use layouts all the time in the first couple of videos you'll see

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,900
 Me manipulating rec transforms directly and lots of people still do that manually right they'll manually update rec transforms

67
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:07,360
 But what I recommend instead is just wherever possible use horizontal vertical or critical instead of manually changing rate transforms and

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,540
 If you're worried about like no the performance the slot count inspector inspector

69
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,400
 It's basically just like horizontal horizontal vertical horizontal vertical horizontal horizontal vertical vertical horizontal vertical

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,900
 It just keeps going. It's like it's insanely deep if you look at the

71
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:29,500
 Inspector spec says that they did come across it, but it wasn't complete apparently

72
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,580
 Part 13 was made a year ago. I

73
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,160
 Don't think it's ever gonna be complete. That's one of the things in my tutorials. I never say that they're complete

74
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,540
 Yeah, I recommend you touch it biggest point of advice is

75
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,600
 Please use the layout components. They are there to help you

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,900
 Manually adjusting right transforms is just not ideal and yeah most UI systems that you'll see in game engines have similar systems where it looks

77
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,800
 Like you're making a mess, but it's just how you do it

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,160
 You know if you think you know you acts is bad or even as DIA says if you think you iron kiddo or unity or unreal

79
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,320
 Is bad just go ahead and hit view source on google.com and just question everything about the universe and what you knew

80
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,180
 Like I because I you know, I'm very familiar with with web design and web development

81
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,080
 I can I can tell you what all of google.com does but it will still take me like five minutes to figure it out

82
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,680
 No, I want to go to google.com. I don't want to search for Google for google.com

83
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
 How the hell did that happen?

84
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,720
 anyway

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,960
 moving forwards I had this interesting conversation very recently some other people in other context but a

86
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,080
 Lot of cases I find tools that people make slower than the actual like real way of doing it

87
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,840
 So I have seen a couple of like things which claim to be

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,160
 UIX creators or UX tool things that make it easier to do UIX, but I always just go back to

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,880
 UX like actual I will now scroll up and down and make sure I haven't missed any other questions Oh

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,280
 Shadow has a different a different problem with the logic step

91
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
 I'll go ahead and look at the code of logic step

92
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,520
 What they want to do is to figure out the the logics for where the node will spawn from the logic step

93
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,400
 So when you when you spawn a node where that's positioned that one I might be able to help you

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,320
 I move I've just got to see where that goes

95
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,480
 Tip. Yeah, it goes to the tip. So the the the

96
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,280
 Tip of the tip the tip of the tooltip is is where that goes so you can go ahead and edit the tip position

97
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,400
 That will answer that one

98
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,160
 You just double check not missing any questions before the YouTube video link got it right now

99
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,500
 I wrote to Specs question

100
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,320
 So Specs says how was this year's MMC voting any new bugs or issues with the voting world or mostly smooth sailing?

101
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,460
 Something interesting happened this year, which didn't happen last year, which I was a little grumpy about

102
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,880
 So I apologize if any of you received the grumpiness of that

103
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,240
 Do you remember that I have to run that thing three days straight and make sure that nothing goes wrong ever?

104
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,200
 Because you know, we try and get like people voting as much as possible

105
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,520
 Some people had issues and some people direct messaged me about those issues

106
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,840
 Great more on that in a moment. Some people posted those issues publicly in a public channel. Not good DM me, please

107
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,160
 It's just better to DM people about problems particularly when they like can be fixed really easily

108
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,440
 It's slightly more polite as well. So we had a couple of those those were fixed up

109
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,380
 And then the one that did DM me about it. They found quite a

110
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,960
 potentially problematic issue

111
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,080
 but they explored it in a way which was not okay, which is

112
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,840
 so they found a way to

113
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,300
 Duplicate and delete the voting panels because I forgot to put delete block and duplicate block on those panels

114
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,220
 I understand finding that and being like that's a problem that needs to be fixed

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,340
 But when I went in the world like five or six of the booths had been deleted or duplicated so were broken

116
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,480
 It's like if you found a problem, maybe do it again another time

117
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,520
 So twice to replicate that is a problem, but then stop don't break any more of the world stop and report the issue

118
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,440
 Because like I think five five panels were down by the time I got there

119
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,440
 So I just took it down for five minutes to fix that one

120
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,960
 That sort of comes into sort of responsible disclosure and things like that. It's like hey

121
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,240
 If I push this button on this bank's website, it gives me a million dollars. So I'm gonna push it a hundred times

122
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,620
 And then tell the bank it's like you push it once until the bank one of the most interesting problems of MMC voting though

123
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
 Is I forgot how it worked. I

124
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,360
 Have a huge notebook

125
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:33,180
 I use obsidian for my notebook and I usually write extensive notes on everything that I do but my notes for MMC's voting

126
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,640
 Were lackluster somehow for some reason. I don't know if I was just like busy or whatever and didn't make them

127
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
 So I just I didn't know anything

128
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,080
 For example when I went through the world testing it I noticed that when you vote in ESD or art

129
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,320
 it'll say saved instead of vote cast for blah and category blah and

130
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,920
 I was like, why is this happening again? This doesn't make sense. Why is it different sort of like debugging madly unpacked a few logics knows

131
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,600
 I'm just like, oh, yeah, that's why we don't have locale strings in the NES locale files for those two categories

132
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,140
 So I can't fully localized do the phrase vote cast in category blah for category blah

133
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,440
 In those two category instances

134
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,040
 So I had to just switch to something I did have a locale string for which is saved

135
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,480
 Saved is one of the locale strings, which is just part of Neos core

136
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,540
 And so I could just stole that one

137
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,120
 in fact

138
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,080
 The majority like, you know, two-thirds or more of the strings that exist inside the voting panel are localized using

139
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,780
 Neos locale strings and then the remainders are used, you know actual MMC specific strings things like okay

140
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:45,220
 Cancel. Yes, you know, those are all available to be localized by everyone. So if you're ever looking to make a world

141
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,800
 for multiple audiences

142
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,520
 You can use those locale strings

143
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,960
 It's a little bit tricky having a tutorial on it and I don't really have time to explain it here

144
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,840
 So I'm asked I probably will try but you know, but you've got that, you know, if you're just using like, okay

145
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,440
 Yes, no save cancel. You've got no excuse not translated to every single language which Neos supports

146
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,960
 I mean for a nationwide question who says

147
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,320
 Why do some logics nodes is a eg is user present in world seemingly just not work without an updating relay after them?

148
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,200
 Shouldn't those knows update themselves since they're all for an updating relation used

149
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,600
 It's difficult for me to understand

150
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,000
 I've asked Fuchs a couple of times, but he seems to answer for that specific case. What I want is

151
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,120
 Like a rule of thumb, but what I get is an individual reason

152
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,440
 So it's a little bit challenging in that regard

153
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,640
 I just opened the is user present node and

154
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,200
 Oh, no, wait, I did the is user on ground node somehow by a mistake. I

155
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,520
 Don't know how that happened because I typed present and I got like oh

156
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,320
 There we go. Yeah. Um, so it just it's just a quirk that I don't understand

157
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,880
 the rule of thumb that I have now established though is

158
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,660
 Put updating relays in if you notice a problem

159
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,420
 But just before you're done making your application before you're done making your world or whatever

160
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:07,840
 It is

161
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,200
 remove those updating relays and see if it still works and the reason I say that is because a lot of times we add updating relays

162
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,480
 Because we want to see the values for a good example of that being is the global transform

163
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,240
 Node we usually want to pull out a display node and look at the global transform of an object as it moves around

164
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,400
 Etc and because we're human we want to see those numbers move

165
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,360
 Maybe that helps us to figure out what we need to do to those numbers to do the effect that we want

166
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,620
 but what we actually then do once we figure those out is we have an impulse chain and

167
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,560
 Little

168
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
 like most understood

169
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,920
 misunderstood think about about logics is when an impulse is

170
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:52,680
 Evaluating nodes along its chain. It will have the most up-to-date value whilst that impulse is being processed

171
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,160
 But the display node might not update still so example

172
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,980
 There might be you take the global transform of a cube and then you write that global transform plus 10 in the Y

173
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:10,300
 So you're just moving up by 10 units, but the global transform display node might not update but the

174
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,880
 Logic knows that it's correct, right?

175
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:21,600
 Because when the impulse fires it can pick up that value because it picks up the most relevant most recent evaluated value from there

176
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,880
 What happens there is that the impulse chain executing will instruct that node to get the latest value

177
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,920
 But that display node doesn't instruct it to get the latest value because it's a different way of looking at it

178
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,140
 Which is then sometimes why the updating relay is needed so you can see their numbers moving

179
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,920
 But if it's only impulses that are using this data

180
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,440
 Then you don't need the updating relay

181
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,440
 Hence if it makes it easier for you to develop logics put the updating relays in there

182
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:54,000
 Try removing them once the logic is complete and then you can be like happy and be like I removed one and I didn't actually

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
 Need it and then you'll start learning when they are on when they are not needed

184
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,320
 As for why some nodes have it and why some nodes don't I don't really know sometimes this is sort of optimization thing

185
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,440
 There are some nodes as well, which are like clearly meant more to be used locally rather than synchronized across the network

186
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,560
 Most of those exist in sort of the weird areas of controllers and things like those

187
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,400
 Like, you know controller nodes always local. I really liked it meant to sync every single controller boolean across the network

188
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,560
 It just meant to sort of sync the result like ah, they push the trigger that means the gunfire

189
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,560
 So we transmit over the network gunfire not trigger pulled. Let's move over to

190
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,820
 additional question

191
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,720
 Shadow asks, is there a good tutorial and a proper use tensor materials and this dead

192
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,160
 This does some parameters on limit

193
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,340
 I've got it to half work one time really like a clear guide on it watching unity tutorials

194
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,080
 It's also not ideal as those include editing shader code, which is different from Neos. No, there is no guide on it

195
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,060
 I usually just scratch my head and scream when I do it, but

196
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,980
 There was one

197
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,620
 I'll try and find it. There was one like blog article that was unity related

198
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,220
 but it had sufficient information for me to understand it and apply it to

199
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,780
 Neos it did talk. Yeah, this is the one it did talk about

200
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,740
 Editing shader code etc. But I I just mapped those shader code editing

201
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,700
 Ujima flips to the material inspector. There is a bug as well, I believe with

202
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,200
 Some of the stuff going on there

203
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,900
 In the some of the the shaders that have stencil parameters don't have Z right and you kind of need to in some cases

204
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,200
 manipulate the Z right operation as well as these stencil parameters to get everything to work and

205
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,720
 I you know couldn't figure that out either looks like this one's good particularly because it references are one of my favorite games which is

206
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,040
 Anti-chamber. I need to do another run of anti-chamber, but like there's a good there's a good link there for it as well

207
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
 All right moving that down to the thread

208
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,000
 So we've got the shader the stencil question done. We'll scroll up and down make sure I haven't missed any others

209
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,080
 No other questions have been missed. So if you have any additional questions, please go ahead and

210
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,080
 Give it a look

211
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,440
 Meant to be like an anti chamber - she did this this Daniel website is a little bit broken

212
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,060
 Because I just clicked a link and it said like localhost 4000 because they haven't updated the logo in the top left there

213
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,060
 they have a bunch of

214
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:32,120
 Universal rendering pipeline tutorial they have a bunch of tutorials. They're a bit old from 2021, but like I will bookmark this website

215
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,520
 OZ I believe I answered that question less than less than a month ago like so

216
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,480
 Well

217
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,540
 Maybe refer to the older notes on that one. No main changes that although I'm thinking of headsets

218
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:54,340
 The big screen headset the one that's really light awesome looking headset, but don't make me require an Apple phone to purchase it

219
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:01,040
 Thanks. There we go. It has to be a 2018 or newer Apple phone and not the SE series. Yeah, that's that's really weird

220
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,560
 I get it because they want the 3d scan data

221
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,920
 If they like partnered with a store, I actually don't know the names of tech stores in the US

222
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,720
 I was about to say Curry's but no one would knowing that any idea what I'm talking about, but Curry's PC world

223
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,040
 Big Best Buy, maybe

224
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,680
 name a tech store, maybe if they partner with a tech store like go to the tech store and

225
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,800
 Have your face scan by a thing there and buy it there. That would be good

226
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,400
 I think they could do that but like it's almost like they're too late for that

227
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,880
 Stores are dying and I've even to a mall recently, but it's crazy

228
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,500
 I bet you the Apple store employees will love that if it gets popular. Are you here to buy an iPhone, sir?

229
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,000
 No, I'm here to scare my face and then leave and never come back would be my response. I did just buy a brand new phone

230
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,280
 I'm now running a

231
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
 pixel 7 pro and

232
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,200
 Come on, but the next time I buy a phone it's gonna be you know, like 2030 or something

233
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,240
 The last time I bought a phone I looked it up was something like 2013. I don't know

234
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,480
 I'll have to after double-check that exact number. I don't really know

235
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,840
 Tiki us is there a way to have more than one camera for recording thought about having a second news client if anything if you mean

236
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,160
 Simultaneously no, there is no way currently to have a second camera to record

237
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,220
 Things that you can do though, and this is really hacky, but I've done it multiple times

238
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,920
 so I will mention it is if you put your camera your main camera into orthographic mode and

239
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,520
 Stick it into a camera anchor you can then position additional cameras in front of that orthographic camera

240
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,740
 And you can kind of set up like a CCTV view, you know

241
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,060
 Where you've got like a grid of four cameras on the screen

242
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:48,320
 And that way you can record multiple camera angles. There is a bit gross though because it's like, you know

243
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,520
 Taking a photo of your phone to like share

244
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,820
 It's that one sometimes with like logs or Neos we asked for log files when you know diagnosing issues

245
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,660
 there are sometimes where I've got like a phone camera picture of the log file on someone's screen and I'm just like

246
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:13,440
 But yeah, it's a bit like doing that but it that has worked a few times we did that for data collection as well

247
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,600
 Sometimes we had like three camera angles and then the third

248
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,260
 Fourth the fourth the final quadrant was data like a graph or something

249
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,700
 And that was like, you know, three camera angles plus a graph to show what's going on. That was good orthographic camera

250
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,780
 Though is is pretty needed there. Otherwise you get the perspective

251
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:42,040
 Doubly added because you're looking at a perspective camera looking at perspective cameras like an orthographic looking at perspective camera. That's fine

252
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:47,040
 But if you're doing two perspectives, sometimes it just looks weird. Okay, I've solved Tiki's problem

253
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,480
 Yeah, we've got exactly what they need there. Yeah, try it out. If you have any issues, let me know

254
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,800
 I do I do it all the time. Also remember the sender display tip

255
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,240
 You might not be able to make the streaming camera orthographic

256
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,680
 So in which case make an orthographic regular camera use the center display tip on it

257
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,200
 And then it'll do the equivalent thing

258
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,940
 The center display tip was the old version of the mirror to display option that exists inside the camera streaming thing

259
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,200
 I think that's what we do. Keep the questions coming. We're um running up against the clock here

260
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,820
 But I'm happy to go if anyone else has any additional questions

261
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,900
 See Jackal is typing so we'll take Jackal's question and then we will leave off

262
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,640
 If you have other questions that would help you understand stuff go for it like, you know, we're here for all levels of

263
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,580
 Understanding. Okay. We'll wait for runtime and shadow now just shadow guys. If you've got questions, you have to type faster. Come on

264
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,680
 I want to hear your like desk make like aggressive banging noises from your typing

265
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,840
 Just so you can get the question out before we close. No, no worries red tape

266
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,860
 It's always weird when you call out people for that typing indicator. I wish you could turn it off

267
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,260
 you can turn it off on I think telegram and

268
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,540
 Maybe what's that? Yeah, I usually if I have the option to I turn it off so people don't see that I am typing

269
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,360
 I think it's just like in some situations

270
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,760
 It can cause anxiety

271
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,580
 Like here's an example you're at work and you use Microsoft Teams and it's like your manager is typing and you notice it

272
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,580
 It's just like oh

273
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:20,560
 Yeah, okay, so we have no further questions some comments on typing noises so go ahead and leave off here

274
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,880
 I'm gonna go consume like half a cow worth of food and I'll get back to you later

275
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,400
 If you have any questions, please drop them in the questions help channel direct message me. Send me carrier pigeons. Send me smoke signals

276
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
 I'll try and respond do

277
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
 Remember that we can all

278
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,520
 Enjoy eating cows

279
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,080
 Not tipsy cow tipsy cow is a restaurant that is about one town over

280
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,960
 It takes me like a 20 to 30 minute bus ride to get there. Otherwise, I'll be going there all the time

281
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,780
 No, I'm just gonna go find whatever's in the cupboard and shove it in my face

282
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,520
 I don't know what it is. I mean look I will speech you later. Bye. Bye
