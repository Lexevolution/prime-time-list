00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
All right everyone, welcome to prime time. Again, it's a half hour AMA where you can ask any questions about Neos.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,560
We don't have any questions today, we just actually have people complaining about my microphone,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,000
which is perfectly natural and please thank you for continuing doing so. If there are any issues,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,280
please do let me know. Microphone's a difficult year. But yeah, we have no questions, so I don't

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,960
need to use the microphone. If you have questions, please put them in the thread and I'll get them as

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
I can, otherwise I'm going to go ahead and mute and we're going to sit here for the entire office

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,600
house segment. We have nothing to talk about. Grace says, can I ask something not to do with

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,960
Neos? Usually it depends on sort of how busy we are. I usually skip personal questions because

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,160
we're busy, but if there are no questions here, go for it. Do whatever you want. I may reject the

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
question depending on what it is. I am only sort of guaranteed to answer Neos questions.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,160
That kind of controls a little bit of the sort of off the track, off the beaten path stuff that we

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,760
have got going sometimes, but doesn't usually control it. Maybe we're talking about jelly

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,120
sandwiches before we know about it. Okay, so our first actual question from Lex who says,

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,560
apart from settings menu, what would be one of the first things in the UI to redesign that would

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,480
change? Not quite sure we got any further than talking about the settings menu. I know that the

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,160
settings menu was going to happen because it would allow us to do a whole lot of other stuff.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,560
Basically, we'd be able to throw check boxes, sliders, drop downs and input boxes for basically

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,080
everything that people don't like. That's why we wanted to do it because right now we're sort of

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,480
limited in that. For those who are unsure what that means, I would like you to go Google images

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,440
of an airplane cockpit and imagine that you were designing that for the first time and needed a

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,680
switch for literally everything that the plane could do and how you would design that. That's

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,800
what the settings UI redesign does. You want to make sure that everything can fit. But no, after

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,320
that we were looking into user blocking, which of course would have UI, but it wouldn't be UI

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,480
redesign. It would be like new UI. However, with that might have come, I don't know, this is just

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,920
me speaking hypothetically, might have come some edits to the contact screen because of course the

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,720
contact screen would have needed new buttons for blocking if we were to do user blocking.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,040
For those in the modding community, I'm sure you're aware of the contact screen needing more

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,000
space to put buttons. For those unaware of the modding scene, Neos mods in the Neos modding group,

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,240
not moderators mods, it's really difficult. The two things have the same phrase, but whatever.

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,120
They kept adding new buttons to the buttons that appear when you select someone in your contact

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,960
screen and eventually it got to the point where like people's Neos contact buttons were overflowing

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,080
and people were like, hey, can we stop adding context buttons? That was a good discussion that

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
occurred over in the modding community. For those who are unaware, modding is perfectly fine and

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
not against our terms of service. You can just go do it. Provided it's not malicious or breaks

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,240
any of the other guidelines, go do it. You don't need mods for a lot of things. Some people come

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,560
into our Discord or come into the modding Discord and be like, where's the flying mod? That's a

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:17,600
native feature, guys. You don't need a mod for that. Gray has a question here. Are you going to

38
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,160
MFF? I didn't know Canadian was going. That's interesting. I was in him at a convention before.

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,480
Yeah, so MFF is Midwest fur fest. I knew it was fur fest. I just didn't know what it was.

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,240
That's a furry convention that's in the Midwest. I don't know anything about it.

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,560
No, I won't be going. I currently don't have a job for those who don't know.

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,600
And so I can't fly random places on a whim because it's expensive. I'd actually cancel a visit to

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,240
a friend's wedding. I had a really good friend, but I just couldn't justify the cost. So I had

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,560
to cancel the visit to their wedding. That made me sad. And yeah, I can't attend conventions.

45
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,760
When I had a job like I had before, I could totally just randomly fly around to wherever

46
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,480
the hell I wanted to because I had a salary, but I don't currently. So I have to avoid travel.

47
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm trying to navigate and negotiate holiday travel plans, which my family are making endlessly

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,480
complicated and I don't want it to be complicated. I just want to hop on a plane and get off and no

49
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,720
one to yell at me. That's actually always the plan for the holiday period is like, no one to yell at

50
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,920
me. That's all I want. If it were up to me, I'd probably just shut my door and do what I wanted

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,720
over the holiday period. But hey, holidays are about family obligations. On a side note,

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,520
whilst I wait for additional questions, I kind of like I do and don't understand fairy conventions.

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,320
So let me just imagine a scenario. OK, so most people at fairy conventions just want to see

54
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,120
people that they know or friends of theirs that they know to see people. And so what they do is

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,160
they pay thousands of dollars to travel halfway around the world or whatever to essentially be

56
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,600
in the most cramped space possible. Instead, what you could just do is say,

57
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,760
this month, this date, where there's no fairy convention happening, this group of people can

58
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,400
go to this town and hang out. And it costs so much less because you don't need fairy convention

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,560
tickets. The hotels aren't ram packed because of all the other people that you'll never interact

60
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,200
with. It's just pick a random time, go to a random town. You'll save so much more money

61
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,320
and you basically make your own convention when that happens, of course. But it's easier to

62
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,960
control than I'm going to go to this place where everyone else is going, these hotels,

63
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,920
which are already rammed full of people to see a great group of people that I do want to speak,

64
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,800
but also hang out with a bunch of people that I don't know that are basically raising the prices

65
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,280
of everything. Lex says, wouldn't conventions be more about booths and discover a wider community?

66
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,080
Yes, there is also that. But if that's what you're going for, that's great. From experience,

67
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,520
a lot of people are going just to see each other. And if that's the case, then don't go to a

68
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,840
convention. It's much cheaper to just visit each other. But yeah, no, booths and stuff like that.

69
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,600
A lot of the convention though is just wandering around and speaking to people. While I haven't

70
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,160
been to any specifically fairy conventions, I have been to various other types of conventions,

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,800
including ones where I have been working there as a person of worky. I actually have in my bedroom

72
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,160
hung around a large teddy bear is my collection of event passes. Every time you go to an event,

73
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:35,120
you get like a lanyard. And I've collected all of them. And it is crazy because I had,

74
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,680
as an example, I have an exhibitor badge for E3 a few years back. An exhibitor badge for E3, yes.

75
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,320
It's one of my proudest moments. That is, I have an exhibitor E3 badge.

76
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Let's take a look. Oh, we have an actual Neos question. That's great. Let's get off the

77
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,800
convention track. So Ozi asks, I noticed volume unlit materials are not super popular due to 3D

78
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,040
textures being hard to understand outside of medical scans. Have you seen them used in Neos?

79
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,280
If so, how? Well, outside of medical scans, no, I haven't seen them. Although there is this

80
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,560
tutorial where I talk about making a GIF. And I think I make one as a joke. I import all the

81
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,760
frames of a GIF as a 3D texture. And it's kind of creepy. I think it's in my public folder somewhere.

82
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,160
It's a Doctor Who GIF of David Tennant as a doctor saying, oh, yes. And you kind of sort

83
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,280
of scroll through it with the slicer. I don't know what you would use a 3D thingy for.

84
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,320
I don't really know, like, when it comes to Neos features, you always need to start with,

85
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,760
what are you trying to do? Otherwise, you'll just be lost. Like, what are you trying to do?

86
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,240
I'm trying to build a boat. OK, then you need prims. You need a design for the boat. You can't

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,000
just build a boat. But I want to build a boat. You know, you need to figure out what you want

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,200
to do before you build a boat. For anyone who got that meme, congratulations. For anyone who did not

89
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,440
get that meme, I'll link a video in a moment. So I don't really know what you'd use them for.

90
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,520
Theoretically, you could use them for things like fog. But then a fog material would be better for

91
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:22,480
that. The 3D texture stuff inside volume unlit is really stressful on your resources.

92
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,520
I don't know enough about shader language to say this for certain. So if you quote me,

93
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,200
quote me with this disclaimer, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not a shader expert.

94
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,600
When I read the shader code for volume unlit, it appears to be remarched. So just be careful with

95
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,040
that shader. It is very intense. Particularly if you drop what's called the step size property

96
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,480
down to zero, you can lower someone's frames. If you drop their step size down to zero and put their

97
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,320
head inside it, you can lower their frames incredibly quickly. I don't know what you'd use it

98
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,800
for other than, of course, medical scans. We've also used it for basically anything that can get

99
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,000
like an image of slices work. Sometimes there are other data sources that can do this. I want to say

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,120
something like a radar scan might be possible. I'm not sure. I'm sort of thinking about those

101
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,920
shockwave things they do to survey ground. You know, there's usually a man. It basically looks

102
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
like they're shotgunning the floor. They're not. They're sending a shockwave through the floor so

103
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,920
they can measure the sort of density of the rocks beneath them. I wonder if that sort of data would

104
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,080
be able to sort of be 3D visualized. I don't know what sort of format it comes back in. Anyway,

105
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,000
we'll move on. They go to show off their bespoke carpet suit. That is another thing. The sort of

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,160
publicity of your character and all of the pictures and stuff like that. Yeah, that's

107
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,080
always good. Moving on to Lex's question who said, so you know how people go to Wikipedia and browse

108
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,520
for ages clicking a bunch of links. It's near so large. Would you happen to do that for the code?

109
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,560
Yeah, that happens a lot. I have a renewed interest in this thing which I don't think

110
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,920
it ever got finished or it's not up to date. It's called Code Bubbles. See if I can...

111
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,520
I just searched that on Instagram. Curse my shortcuts. Code Bubbles. I have the DuckDuckGo

112
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,080
browser doodads. If you do exclamation mark gi space, it will search Google Images. If you

113
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,440
do exclamation mark i space, it will search Instagram. I just dropped the g. It's really

114
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,320
old but I have a renewed interest in maybe making it figure out maybe if it's suitable.

115
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,040
So there's a picture of it. So instead of navigating code via files, you navigate them

116
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,040
via bubbles. The reason why that's great is because I can control click about 20 times before

117
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,920
I actually get to the code I need inside the Neos codebase because I'm not familiar with all aspects

118
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,000
of it. As an example, the other day I needed to figure out why... like the context menu code I

119
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,920
needed to figure out the other day and it was just very thick. I don't mean thick as in silly,

120
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,640
it's quite well written, but it was very thick as in I was in the input drivers and all sorts

121
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,760
before I found out exactly what I needed to do. There was also a problem I was having with the

122
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,640
world browser another day where I'd added a bunch of log statements to half of Neos to figure out

123
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,120
something that was going wrong and then I figured out I just made an oopsie and it was a single line

124
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
change. I'd actually then go like pull out all those log statements. It took like half an hour

125
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,560
to pull out all those logs and get rid of them. That is kind of a meme though, removing log

126
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,240
statements once you've fixed a bug. It's kind of sort of a thing that you'll know if you're a

127
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,720
programmer. Arguably you should leave those log statements in there and then just sort of flag

128
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,600
them off, but flag logging isn't something we have currently. I'll probably sort of try and get that

129
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,320
in when I can. So moving on to Ozzy's question who says, related to Lexi's question, what's a funny

130
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,040
Easter egg in the Neos code base? There's a bunch. You'll see actually one of them that exists in the

131
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
latest tutorial I did which is in desktop mode. In desktop mode my cursor is a piece of cheese,

132
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:15,200
it isn't the usual desktop cursor. That's because when Frix was creating the desktop mode he needed

133
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,160
to make a cursor image and I don't know why it came up but I was just like maybe custom cursor

134
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,240
images in the future? Mine would be cheese and then he just added it to the code base.

135
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,160
We are removing some of the sort of old memes, particularly ones that have caused some confusion

136
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,600
in the past. For example there is a joke screen which can be added to your assets, your dash.

137
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,960
I don't remember the circumstances in which it was added but it adds a screenshot of discord because

138
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:48,000
someone asked for a discord like tab on the dash and so we added a screenshot as a joke but then

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,560
someone wrote a mod to re-enable that dash facet screen and then a lot of people got confused in

140
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,440
the modding community and thought that we'd somehow got a discord client into Neos which is incorrect

141
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,920
because that is against the discord terms of service so thumbs up. So yeah there's stuff like

142
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,840
that that we're kind of removing. Sometimes it's just the comments that are funny though.

143
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,240
When code doesn't make sense you know there's all the memes about sort of comments that say things

144
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,640
like don't edit this code you'll die if you edit this code or this code is really difficult to

145
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,320
understand but sometimes there's just like funny stuff that exists there and you can kind of feel

146
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,040
and see their pain but in a more comical way than the standard sort of like this code is bad it's

147
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,720
sort of you know I don't know why this works but it does and those are those are some funny easter

148
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,560
eggs. With that we're out of questions so if anyone has any additional questions do let me know

149
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,080
let somebody go look up that build a boat meme. Oh I got an email that's cool I'll have to deal with

150
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,160
that later. There we go there's the build a boat meme it comes from Second Life. I don't answer

151
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,200
cheese questions Gray Foxen. Cheese questions have all been answered in prior office hours please

152
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,920
check the notes. Okay looking through oh we have another question fantastic thank you for the

153
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,880
additional question. When working on the spirit sweepers game we found almost every action

154
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,160
involving the player equipping, dequipping, avatars, moving the character, installing

155
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,000
locomotions was best performed by the user versus another user or host. I understand networking is

156
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,360
typically the go-to thing to blame but I'm wondering why that is. I think that's probably

157
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,440
a function of synchronization so as a good analogy here when you think about a first-person

158
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,200
shooter game two things happen when you shoot a gun in a first-person shooter game and this is

159
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,280
like maybe older information from my brain I haven't looked at how new FPSs work but there are

160
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,920
two things that happen and they are separate. Number one is animations happen so you shoot a

161
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,480
game in an FPS animations happen you see the bullet leave the gun you see noise you see the

162
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,760
muzzle flash you see whatever it hits you see particles from whatever it hits that is separate

163
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,000
from what is actually happening to figure out if you actually hit them which is usually what's

164
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,960
called a hit scan which is basically just a physics raycast right that is a separate operation

165
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,680
now sometimes that physics hit scan is performed locally which gets a result but that is also then

166
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,600
sent to the server to perform a server-side calculation to see if that actually happened

167
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,760
from an authoritative point of view and depending on the synchronization of those events you can get

168
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,600
sort of the gun doesn't fire but you kill someone the gun does fire but you don't kill someone

169
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
and then you know the actual one that you want which is the gun does fire visually and you

170
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,800
actually kill someone and you get the points and if all of those aren't synced up then you end up

171
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,040
with a game which is not satisfying excuse me there I almost died for a second words are

172
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:53,280
difficult sometimes for neos that's sort of the same thing kind of happens there are nodes and

173
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:00,240
operations which are validated by the host but the trigger of that event should be as close to

174
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,960
the event as possible so you're right in saying it should be the user carrying out the interaction

175
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,040
and that is because they will start to see the results of that interaction first and it'll be

176
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,920
snappy additionally if you trigger an event for a user from another user then that other user has

177
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
to send that message to the host and then the host has to send that message to the user that

178
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,800
actually the event is for so just try and keep that smaller right so if you're equipping an

179
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,360
avatar you want that to come from the person which is equipping the avatar you don't want

180
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:37,280
that coming from OZ or Lex you know on other sides of the planet like let's say you know Lex

181
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:43,280
is over in Australia I'm over in America and Lex equips an avatar for me that's like okay cool

182
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,440
Lex sends a message to the host let's say the host is in Europe it says equip an avatar for Prime and

183
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,760
then the host has to send that message to me and it says yo you've equipped another avatar there's

184
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:00,080
latency there yeah things things can get really really strange and like the most annoying thing

185
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,160
as well like desync is one of the most annoying things you just don't feel like a human great

186
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,800
asks a metaphysical question which is always interesting what kind of life form would you be

187
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,200
if you couldn't be a carbon-based one I have like a interesting answer on that one which is like

188
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,120
I don't particularly enjoy biological life if that makes sense we're gross like humans are gross

189
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:33,440
right we constantly need to like shove crap in our face and every like every pore in your skin

190
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,080
is currently producing like goop that you don't want and so periodically you have to go wash it

191
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:46,480
off it's gross so I think like the idea of identity being just floating there is good

192
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,480
there are lots of films which try to do that but they usually do it as like

193
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,520
oh it's a floating cloud of like glowy mist or glowy light and I'm just like

194
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:05,200
oh yeah look into that non-corporeal I guess would be the thing right I don't

195
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,440
I don't I don't want to leak goop everywhere but I do leak goop everywhere like right now I'm warm

196
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,400
right so I'm leaking more goop than I should be doing I should take off my sweater anyway

197
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,800
let's move on and stop talking about goop who's he asked do you have a strategy with best

198
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,960
combating corrections and sessions or what to exactly look for sometimes it can be massively

199
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,240
annoying trying to understand what could be causing them like apparently world intensity

200
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:38,640
world color systems being driven which is saddening that like could be a bunch of problems

201
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,960
all in one and I think the best answer there would be of course in terms of features to wait

202
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,360
for hard permissions at that point we can sort of say hey you can't drive this particular system

203
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:59,760
because it's it's not yours to drive but whilst that doesn't occur I always like to

204
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,840
sort of restart the world with no one in it and see what the problems and then journey around the

205
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,560
world looking for those problems it's it's always difficult to figure out what's going on there

206
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:21,040
lots of stuff which people do can be undesirable but they don't know it's undesirable or

207
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,280
they've put something on the avatar and they don't even know how it works and it's undesirable

208
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,440
I'm looking at you with the bells on your collars please configure your bells such that they have

209
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,880
a localized volume and not global volume and maybe use your own sound effect not the common

210
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,000
sound effect which is used on 99% of bells now I have seen some good bells out there like I'm

211
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,960
seeing a change there are some good bells out there but the majority of bells are exactly the

212
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,320
same as I've been seeing for years and they are incredibly loud incredibly annoying in global

213
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:58,880
audio space and I can't like they're so shrill as well I know that kind of went to like my common

214
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:06,240
rant about bells but you know um if you have like a specific circumstance let me know it's

215
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
difficult to answer sort of generically about saying like hard permissions would probably help

216
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,480
with that no no bells bells aren't bad it's the way that they're configured I've changed my

217
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,560
opinion on bells recently to be 99% of bells are bad because I have seen a few that are okay

218
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,560
maybe I should go to MFF I'll take like a church bell with me and just constantly ring it I'll put

219
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,120
it like on a dolly and just like push it around the convention and just be like ringing it

220
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,520
continually I'm also waiting for additional questions Lex is that interstellar does it well

221
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,480
with a fourth dimensional being that does it well yep I agree um star trek discovery one of the

222
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,960
later seasons does it well I can't really say much without doing spoilers but there is a creature in

223
00:20:50,960 --> 00:21:00,000
there which which is great um if I said like cosmic horror you'd see like you know the additional

224
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,120
forms of life that aren't goop bags are interesting to me I think although the aliens in arrival are

225
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:16,240
good and are very strange they still are goop bags so no goop speaking of goop after this

226
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:24,160
office hours I'm gonna go get another another mug of coffee which is just goop I'm gonna go drink

227
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:32,880
some goop I see what you mean Ozi so Ozi says um that they were trying to optimize uh some session

228
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,480
performance issues and they found some funny systems such as a fire on change of no user

229
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,760
attached a localized dine bar that did a loop through of hundred slots to turn off lights

230
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,160
all sorts of stuff like that if using dynamic variables why do you need to loop to turn off

231
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,000
lights just use a dynamic variable driver and a world scoped variable and you can turn off all

232
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,480
the lights without a loop what the hell maybe I should do a tutorial on that just turning off

233
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,840
a hundred lights with a dynamic variable because like without dynamic variables I can agree that

234
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,000
would probably be difficult but with dynamic variables holy crap that's like most great

235
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,480
thing ever I know that there is a little bit of a stigma around using the world dynamic variable

236
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,920
space but if the lights and the objects are part of the world which you own which you are building

237
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,840
use the world dynamic variable space exclusively it's great I use it a lot for the science that

238
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,920
I'm doing because I'm like this isn't a world for socialness this is a world for science so I can

239
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,440
just shove stuff in the world dynamic variable space all day it's great like if you go into a

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,720
world of mine where we're doing science it's eye movements eye rotation the secret to the life

241
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,600
that you diverse and everything it's all in the wild the world uh the variable space but if I'm

242
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,000
building like an avatar or I'm building an object which is designed to go into other people's worlds

243
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,880
then it doesn't use world because that is kind of rude. Grace says if you go to mmf would you

244
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,920
consider wearing a tf2 spy costume with a paper furry mask as a disguise no there's a 3d printer

245
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,240
in my bedroom which I packed up because I was going to move apartments then didn't I would

246
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,800
unpack that up I would print off my mask I have links saved in my browser for everything I would

247
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:22,080
need to authentically recreate my avatar irl and that is what you would see I would even take a

248
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,440
drill and drill like a hole into the mouth hole so I can like put a straw in there and drink from it

249
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,000
because I think a that would be funny and b it would be ironic people like ah it's lunchtime

250
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,120
Prime's finally going to remove his mask of like nope as I just like cram goop in my mouth hole

251
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,800
okay we're at 28 so if there are no more questions we'll be closing down shortly I see

252
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,560
Ruscio's typing if you have a question please go ahead Lex if you're typing you can get a question

253
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,520
as well otherwise we'll be ending after these questions are sorted out. Lex asks how do you

254
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,480
feel about sounder shutting down its podcast hosting service are you going to migrate to

255
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:08,560
another podcast hosting service or just use the wiki um I don't know right now it kind of

256
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,480
agitates me that the reason why I picked sounder in the first place is because they had automatic

257
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,360
transcription and then they turned off automatic transcription and now they're shutting down so

258
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,640
it's really annoying I'll look around and see what like stuff is there I just want it to be like

259
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,680
automatic I kind of know that Lex does a bunch of work after office hours to to process the audio

260
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,000
and then put it on the wiki I want it to be automatic and that's my like goal so that's why

261
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,920
I started with sounder and then just went downhill I will do what I can I don't really know what I'm

262
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,080
going to do though it is on my to-do list to look at it's just not very high enough to do this right

263
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,600
now okay um cutting off questions after Ramper because because Stifle you snuck one in there

264
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,040
that's absolutely fine but but Ramper if you've got a question perfect otherwise no more questions

265
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,160
you know when like an umpire declares safe on umpires that the baseball I don't know baseball

266
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,400
terms the guy wearing all the armor he's like they're they're saying that that that's the

267
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,880
motion I'm doing right now if you know baseball let me know what I'm saying yeah cool

268
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,520
Rusev says I've been hearing more and more users coming into worlds for starting point in logic so

269
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,240
particularly I would typically take the time to start showing them but unfortunately been too

270
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,280
busy to provide building stuff to provide assistance you know any good starting points

271
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:32,320
to recommend when you can't provide direct help um I you know in the military where people do drills

272
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,480
and part of the reason there is that they want they want users of of you know weapons or equipment

273
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,800
or orders like half the point for you know militaries so that people follow orders of that

274
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,800
question to just do what they're told without thinking about it and that's why you know you

275
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,840
clean your gun you just you you know you dismantle the gun you put it back together you load it you

276
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,960
unload it you check the chain you do all that stuff so you know when it's drummed into you

277
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,000
I want people to do that when they learn logics with the logics tip I see so many people struggle

278
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,080
because they don't take the time to understand the like the terminology and the mechanics of just

279
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,160
using the logics tip um so a good example there that I have I don't know where I put it in my

280
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,120
public folder um someone knows because it's in the um the mentor workshop world so glad to see that

281
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:30,240
I edited a logics tip to um have a node menu attached to it which just has maths nodes

282
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,480
and I think I removed some of the sort of options on the context menu somehow or maybe I didn't I

283
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,120
can't remember um that's good though because what that does is it's purely there to teach you

284
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,520
spawning nodes and linking two nodes together and that's what I want people to start with I don't

285
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,600
want people to start with I want to build a boat or on a boat again I want people to start with

286
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,400
spawning a node connecting a node to another node disconnecting a node from another node

287
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:59,120
packing and unpacking and so when we get into complex tutorials and I say and then spawn this

288
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,840
node I don't get wait how do I do that again like I want that to be like memory and for those of you

289
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,000
who have been doing logics for a while you know that that's memory you know if I say to you oh

290
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,360
yeah you'll need a four node for that you like automatically half the people in this office hours

291
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,600
are like oh yeah flow loop right you know like you did it in your head really quickly and it was

292
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
almost subconscious right I want that to happen for people who are learning logics so many people

293
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,040
get like down in the depths of logics and then I don't understand how anything works it's like

294
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:35,600
okay do you know how to spawn a node well I keep forgetting that okay cool welcome to boot camp

295
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,280
today we'll be sporting a node 400 times and then you'll know how to do it additionally a good

296
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,080
tip as well is for that that mathematical logics node browser I talked about the reason why I did

297
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,080
that is because the logic nodes for maths don't have any confusion they all spawn with float the

298
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,080
data types by default which means you don't have to worry about data types none of them have

299
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,440
impulse lines because impulse lines are confusing when you start none of them have reference lines

300
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,120
which are confusing when you start by references I mean things like slots and users and then

301
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,960
it's just mathematics and you connect them two together I remember Zane I haven't really seen

302
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,760
Zane on Neos that much but for those who know Zane I saw Zane and he didn't know logics and I gave him

303
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,480
like I didn't have that an logic node browser at the time but I drew like a box like a rectangle

304
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,600
around a grouping of nodes and it was just plus minus divided in times and I said just link these

305
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,800
together those are the only nodes that you can you can use you can't use any other folders you can't

306
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:36,320
use any nodes that have white ribbons you can just use these nodes and he put them together and he

307
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,600
was doing mathematics and learning how the you know the techniques of that worked and he said

308
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,080
well what can I do I'm kind of comfortable with that and so I gave him the t node the t node that

309
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,600
just counts up and he plugged that into all of his maths and he's like well t isn't round over here

310
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,840
but over here I have a round number and it's like cool that that's that's great you appear to have

311
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,600
rounded a number accidentally by using a bunch of mathematics that's cool and they were enjoying it

312
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,400
and then I think I plugged their random mathematics into the shape of a sphere or

313
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,640
something and it was like jumping around and then they got the picture I don't I don't like how you

314
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,400
know we start with like I want to make a gun or I want to make a custom multi-tool or a custom

315
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,920
inspector start with can you spawn a node and can you link them together okay moving down to

316
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,760
stifle who says when a user is under a slot with a tag and I think created not spawned from the

317
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,440
inventory will have that tag that is created including object logic's important assets what

318
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,680
are some good use cases for it I don't know that can be useful for like tags are meant to sort of

319
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,200
be like categorization of objects so I don't really know why that functionality was originally

320
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:51,200
added I would ask freaks freaks is kind of busy right now so I don't really know what might be

321
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:59,440
uses for that kind of have an example I guess from a world I'm building where I need I need

322
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,120
every object that has a certain tag to be parented under at least some other object right it can't

323
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,560
go to root so many things in news that are either written by users or not written by users sometimes

324
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,880
it's you know nodes or components or just accidentally parent stuff to root and that

325
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,840
cannot happen for this world and so I start attacking stuff that needed to not be under root

326
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,280
as a certain tag and then I could I could pick that up and repairing it to where it needed to

327
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,960
go that was useful yes that's a use remember guys though tags aren't evil I made a whole tutorial

328
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,360
on that because tags used to be used for data storage and people are like tags are bad no tags

329
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,360
are fantastic you just need to use them correctly braces this is a podcast no not really but I was

330
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,800
struggling to get it up on the wiki because the wiki is you know kind of unreliable sometimes

331
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,560
and I found this service called sounder and I put it on sounder and it turns out you know

332
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:57,840
sounder is a podcast platform and it automatically dumps my episodes into spotify so I'm podcast now

333
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:08,000
hi all right then the last question that we have is from ramp who says I mean the transcriber could

334
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,640
be made for you by community with some good ml people otherwise I heard my question just answered

335
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,680
not to ask if there any form of I'll figure something out like I'll probably move it to

336
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,240
another podcasting platform I just don't know which one it would need I guess better transcription

337
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,800
like I would love if like if it did whisper api just like just by itself that would be great

338
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,800
because it means that that Lex wouldn't have to do it not that I don't want him to do it it's just

339
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,640
I want it to be as automatic as possible as automatic as possible you know it's up to me

340
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,280
every time I made a tutorial I make a page of notes about it that includes everything you see

341
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,400
in the description field I would love it if I could basically hand the video file and the

342
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:55,680
description text file to some program and be like do it right and it would like I don't know make a

343
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,520
thumbnail upload it post it on twitter post it in discord and I wouldn't have to deal with it because

344
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:09,760
automation is cool as linker says tags as in tags on the item inspector yeah in slot tags tags are

345
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,440
used like everywhere like there's tags on records there's tags on assets there's tags on contacts

346
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,120
there's tags on users tags on slots within a world with that I believe we're done so I'm gonna go

347
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,640
ahead and end off here if you guys have any additional questions please do direct message

348
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,120
me post them in questions and help or speak to anyone else that might be able to help you out

349
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,200
I will see you again next week do you remember that you can submit questions before the session

350
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,720
as well you can find that form on the office hours wiki pages along with

351
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:59,440
prior notes from all the other sessions I hope you all have a fantastic day
