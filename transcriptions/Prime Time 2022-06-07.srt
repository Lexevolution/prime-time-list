0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.000
Hello, it is now time for office hours. It's the top of the hour, so welcome to office hours for prime

2
0:00:05.000 --> 0:00:08.360
This is primetime if you have any questions, please drop them in the officers chat

3
0:00:08.360 --> 0:00:12.560
That's two channels above the current one that you're in if there are no questions. We'll sit here in silence

4
0:00:13.320 --> 0:00:17.440
Enjoy, have fun. So our first question here is from rampa rampa says

5
0:00:18.120 --> 0:00:22.640
That they're asking if it'd be possible to build a modding reference on the nearest wiki, and if yes

6
0:00:22.640 --> 0:00:25.740
What sort of it's up to you you can put whatever you want on the wiki

7
0:00:25.740 --> 0:00:32.700
People seem to still be under the impression even with the policy that modding is somehow bad. Just do what you want

8
0:00:33.300 --> 0:00:38.660
The important juncture to make though is to make sure that people understand that modding is a choice

9
0:00:38.660 --> 0:00:43.020
And it is not a mandate and I don't believe that people should be

10
0:00:44.140 --> 0:00:46.940
Forced or obligated to mod

11
0:00:47.460 --> 0:00:53.300
And that might happen depending on how we present it and the features that are available in those mods

12
0:00:53.300 --> 0:00:55.660
So just be careful about how the way things are worded

13
0:00:57.100 --> 0:01:03.900
Yeah, that's it really to do what you want. Oh, we should also make sure that you know it's not supported you break something

14
0:01:05.220 --> 0:01:06.820
Neos can't help you

15
0:01:06.820 --> 0:01:11.720
Serum has an interesting follow-up question which is how to make sure that you're not committing a source leak by source leak I

16
0:01:11.900 --> 0:01:16.600
Predict that you're referring to the the EU the wordage about stuff like that

17
0:01:17.220 --> 0:01:22.420
I mean, but depending on what type of documentation or after I probably actually wouldn't suggest the wiki

18
0:01:22.420 --> 0:01:30.180
I'm like technical documentation such as the one that you're describing so header type info stuff like that isn't suitable for a wiki

19
0:01:31.540 --> 0:01:37.060
it would be more suitable for some sort of custom tooling if it's custom tooling that also means you can do what you want over on

20
0:01:37.060 --> 0:01:38.060
the

21
0:01:38.060 --> 0:01:42.180
Neos mod loaders kind of website etc so maybe look into that

22
0:01:43.700 --> 0:01:45.340
Don't I

23
0:01:45.340 --> 0:01:46.900
can't really like

24
0:01:46.900 --> 0:01:54.900
Enforce or common or like say when it comes to the EU though like what isn't isn't available because that's based on the company

25
0:01:54.900 --> 0:01:56.900
And I'm not part of a said company so

26
0:01:57.500 --> 0:01:59.220
Keep an eye on that

27
0:01:59.220 --> 0:02:03.060
My recommendation would be to keep it as like little as possible

28
0:02:04.260 --> 0:02:09.840
Like you can explain modding without too much like Neos source code stuff

29
0:02:10.780 --> 0:02:14.980
But yeah like technical information, which I would call reference type

30
0:02:14.980 --> 0:02:18.900
Which is like you know like hey this variable is of type this this is of type

31
0:02:18.900 --> 0:02:22.860
This isn't suitable for a wiki there are much better tools out there for that

32
0:02:23.900 --> 0:02:25.020
Yeah

33
0:02:25.020 --> 0:02:28.620
All right any other questions drop them in office hours text chat

34
0:02:28.620 --> 0:02:33.420
Which is to about the channel that you're in to enter this office hours segment, and I'll get to them in the order that they appear

35
0:02:35.060 --> 0:02:36.900
For those just joining if you have questions

36
0:02:36.900 --> 0:02:41.380
Please drop them in the office hours text chat that is two channels above the one you clicked to get into this and I'll answer

37
0:02:41.380 --> 0:02:45.020
them in the order that they appear we don't have any questions right now, so we'll sit in

38
0:02:46.020 --> 0:02:47.420
unending

39
0:02:47.420 --> 0:02:52.060
Torment of just silence so Lex has an interesting question regarding a question

40
0:02:52.060 --> 0:02:55.020
I asked yesterday and the questions at help which is I was asking for the

41
0:02:55.660 --> 0:03:01.340
Text that needed to be entered into the attached component menu for a sinker a float which I was what I needed yesterday

42
0:03:02.700 --> 0:03:04.700
So the reason I need to sinker a float

43
0:03:05.660 --> 0:03:06.860
Yesterday was the time

44
0:03:06.860 --> 0:03:12.460
I'm trying to graph stuff and for those who haven't done graphing in nears you need to use a value graph recorder and

45
0:03:13.180 --> 0:03:14.500
a

46
0:03:14.500 --> 0:03:19.400
Rec line mesh or uix rec line mesh. I think it's the same component. Just different wording whatever

47
0:03:20.700 --> 0:03:25.220
Due to layouting those things usually need to be located like distinctly apart from each other

48
0:03:25.740 --> 0:03:31.180
And so I have a list of configuration objects which define like what the graph should look like

49
0:03:31.180 --> 0:03:36.980
Which are separate from the graphing area and so I need some way to link those across

50
0:03:38.020 --> 0:03:40.020
across slots now of course

51
0:03:40.780 --> 0:03:44.760
Everyone will say like you know dynamic variables would be great for that, but like hey

52
0:03:44.760 --> 0:03:49.020
I need a dynamic variable a reference to a sinker a float

53
0:03:49.500 --> 0:03:53.280
So that I can write it into the value graph recorder. It was like

54
0:03:54.060 --> 0:03:56.660
Fun, I think there's a way to do it now

55
0:03:56.660 --> 0:04:03.020
I have the appropriate component hierarchy like text available, but like I gotta like

56
0:04:03.540 --> 0:04:07.180
Figure out what I want to do there. I also need to do like a tiered

57
0:04:08.140 --> 0:04:13.660
Like a delete eating so when you delete the graph entry it will be like all right

58
0:04:13.660 --> 0:04:20.260
I deleted the graph entry cool. I can hop over to the graph area and also delete the the graph that's on the other side and

59
0:04:20.260 --> 0:04:26.820
That that should be fun. I can do that with like some dynamic variables that are slots because that's easy

60
0:04:26.820 --> 0:04:33.060
But I don't know if I I might even need to do like the sink ref sinker a I'll take a look at the next time

61
0:04:33.060 --> 0:04:33.980
I've been

62
0:04:33.980 --> 0:04:40.220
Moving onwards we have another question from book sure who says is there a way to override or add up to an avatars?

63
0:04:40.220 --> 0:04:45.820
I can't a mission another animation like some other time. I have a different way of walking compared to what procedure walking has yes

64
0:04:45.820 --> 0:04:47.980
I'm so glad you asked because so many people ask about this

65
0:04:47.980 --> 0:04:53.380
Um all of the walking animations in years are procedural, and they are editable by you

66
0:04:53.380 --> 0:04:54.900
You just need to know where to look

67
0:04:54.900 --> 0:05:00.660
Inspect the root of your avatar and find I can ever remember if it's on vRak or vRak avatar or whatever

68
0:05:00.660 --> 0:05:02.780
But just like those those components

69
0:05:03.300 --> 0:05:06.100
They'll be list of things called gates gates control

70
0:05:06.100 --> 0:05:12.140
How you walk and they are entirely procedural and you can define all sorts of stuff like how big a step is

71
0:05:12.140 --> 0:05:15.500
so if you increase the step size you get to sort of a

72
0:05:15.500 --> 0:05:19.620
A march which German soldiers did around world war two called goose stepping

73
0:05:19.700 --> 0:05:24.620
It's kind of sort of like frowned upon to do that sort of thing because you know

74
0:05:26.780 --> 0:05:32.300
It's reminiscent of those troops back then but other military people do do it as well

75
0:05:33.100 --> 0:05:36.300
All right, here's a picture. Yeah, it looks like lots of military to it

76
0:05:36.300 --> 0:05:40.820
I just remember it being like overly associated with Nazis, so I don't usually mention it anyway um

77
0:05:40.820 --> 0:05:42.820
Hey

78
0:05:43.500 --> 0:05:45.500
so if you edit the

79
0:05:46.300 --> 0:05:48.300
if you edit the

80
0:05:48.460 --> 0:05:54.540
Gate settings, and then you'll end up with all sorts of stuff. This is who is this China?

81
0:05:54.540 --> 0:06:00.680
This is the Chinese military doing that kind of march you know where their foot is is reaching unnaturally far forward

82
0:06:00.680 --> 0:06:07.860
So you can totally control that in the gate that would probably be in the feet range because that's the range which your feet move

83
0:06:07.860 --> 0:06:09.860
I you want to go through and document

84
0:06:09.860 --> 0:06:15.500
All of those properties actually you know they are but they are quite cool

85
0:06:15.500 --> 0:06:19.900
I do know the speed ratio if you increase that that's the number of steps that occur

86
0:06:20.060 --> 0:06:25.220
And so if you made that really high you'll basically end up looking like a jackhammer right your feet

87
0:06:25.220 --> 0:06:27.220
Or just constantly be like clapping on the floor

88
0:06:27.660 --> 0:06:33.260
So so take a look at those play around with them my best recommendation for you is to remove all of them

89
0:06:33.260 --> 0:06:37.140
So except one and then change the milling velocity on that one to be

90
0:06:37.140 --> 0:06:44.060
Just zero so it always applies and then play around with that one the reason why there are multiples depending on the velocity is because as

91
0:06:44.060 --> 0:06:46.260
you increase in speed your

92
0:06:48.660 --> 0:06:53.720
Your stance to change if you think of a horse a horse goes through several gates as they speed up

93
0:06:55.060 --> 0:06:59.620
She holds gates like a really interesting like thing topic to read about but

94
0:07:00.300 --> 0:07:03.020
That's for another day. I've ridden a horse once

95
0:07:03.020 --> 0:07:09.380
It's a wikipedia article about goose stepping. It is stupid. It is incredibly inefficient. Do not goose step

96
0:07:09.380 --> 0:07:13.420
I don't know why they do it. It's impressive. I guess and can be very synchronized

97
0:07:13.980 --> 0:07:19.260
All right moving around to questions someone said I missed one, so I'm gonna head hump for that one. Oh yes

98
0:07:19.260 --> 0:07:21.260
I miss specs question

99
0:07:21.340 --> 0:07:23.340
specs asked

100
0:07:23.420 --> 0:07:29.260
I'm working on some monitoring stuff ahead this and there's much public variables related to time for sessions like average update time last update time

101
0:07:29.300 --> 0:07:32.140
Do you know if these are measured in nanoseconds or milliseconds or something like that?

102
0:07:32.140 --> 0:07:34.140
I have no idea

103
0:07:35.220 --> 0:07:41.340
Usually our unit is like seconds because we use a float and then fractionals of that second or then milliseconds

104
0:07:41.340 --> 0:07:45.900
But I don't know I'd have to look jump it up and down to came out races questions

105
0:07:45.900 --> 0:07:50.600
So dre says easiest place to get a good help start the logics besides just picking up the logic starting

106
0:07:51.020 --> 0:07:57.660
Honestly pick up the logic step and start I don't on my channel have any sort of beginner or introductory videos to logic

107
0:07:57.660 --> 0:08:02.140
But I know that other channels do basement note has a very good video about just getting started

108
0:08:03.180 --> 0:08:07.860
Something which I will encourage you to do is to just do stuff and not worry about it a lot of stuff

109
0:08:07.860 --> 0:08:10.700
I do with people is to encourage them to just laid out

110
0:08:10.900 --> 0:08:16.900
Nodes and not really worry what they're doing a lot of people like are they I want to use logics to make you know

111
0:08:17.580 --> 0:08:19.980
Half-life Alex to well that's a bit of a stretch

112
0:08:19.980 --> 0:08:24.340
You don't know logics or they'll go like I want to make this really complicated gun and like well

113
0:08:24.340 --> 0:08:25.020
That's a bit of a stretch

114
0:08:25.020 --> 0:08:30.620
Why don't you try adding two numbers together and then go from there right make logics?

115
0:08:30.620 --> 0:08:35.840
That doesn't really have a function outside of your learning, and you'll get a lot better there also forget

116
0:08:35.840 --> 0:08:37.260
Well, you know about all programming

117
0:08:37.260 --> 0:08:41.780
Logics just isn't programming people like is it like C sharp, or is it like Java and I might know

118
0:08:41.780 --> 0:08:47.060
It's just logics like it's it's it's often better to just forget what you already know and just learn it from scratch

119
0:08:47.820 --> 0:08:51.060
Rampers is would be possible to get to try and brace don't create some sort of guidelines

120
0:08:51.060 --> 0:08:58.420
What what would enforce modding docs from an approved shareable Intel for about from the team side is an appendix to the modern policy

121
0:08:58.420 --> 0:09:00.700
I'm still not sure what you're on about here like

122
0:09:01.180 --> 0:09:06.500
You can't share of course decompiled code. That's against the Euler you can't

123
0:09:08.020 --> 0:09:12.740
Share stuff that breaks the guidelines right or come after you about that, but anything else you should be fine

124
0:09:12.740 --> 0:09:15.740
I look at all the source codes for all the mods, and I'm like that's fine. I

125
0:09:15.740 --> 0:09:22.340
Don't know it's like I don't know like I wouldn't be able to write a guideline or a policy against that because I don't know

126
0:09:22.340 --> 0:09:27.500
What what you need I don't understand if I'm the correctly or not

127
0:09:27.500 --> 0:09:35.260
But like I think going back to gates for a second an unoccupied avatar will still match the gates when you move it

128
0:09:35.780 --> 0:09:39.180
and so something I've experimented with doing is putting a

129
0:09:39.180 --> 0:09:46.900
an avatar on the floor so that their feet are touching the floor on an axis panner and then varying the speed of axis pattern

130
0:09:46.900 --> 0:09:50.580
Sometimes that will show the gates about you being in the avatar. Just kind of cool

131
0:09:50.580 --> 0:09:53.580
I did have a world that was looking to make that into a tool

132
0:09:54.060 --> 0:09:59.220
It's gonna be called like on a gate editor right and you would like sort of load your avatar into I guess a treadmill

133
0:09:59.220 --> 0:10:03.180
And then you would set the speed of the treadmill and watch how the feet work

134
0:10:03.180 --> 0:10:06.880
But I don't particularly know if that works or what state that will be in

135
0:10:06.880 --> 0:10:12.720
A trace follows up their question learning logics with there's some people going to very nitty-gritty of it. Yeah, that's problematic

136
0:10:12.720 --> 0:10:18.400
Don't let them do that. Um, I see a lot of people that like, you know, they'll inspect logics nodes

137
0:10:18.400 --> 0:10:23.220
So they'll talk about performance or worrying about nodes or say hey don't use this or don't use that

138
0:10:23.660 --> 0:10:27.120
Every single logics node that exist is designed to be used by you

139
0:10:27.320 --> 0:10:33.400
So if anyone tells you not to use anything particularly whilst you're learning don't listen to them. Just you use it

140
0:10:33.400 --> 0:10:38.560
I don't advise they also talk about dress talks about starting with gestures

141
0:10:38.560 --> 0:10:43.080
I don't advise gestures like I don't advise learning learning logics via gestures. You'll just give yourself a headache

142
0:10:43.520 --> 0:10:51.240
I want you to learn logics not how to build something. So layout nodes look at the things look at the

143
0:10:51.760 --> 0:10:53.760
way that things work

144
0:10:54.160 --> 0:10:56.840
Another very important thing is to get your vocabulary down

145
0:10:57.160 --> 0:11:02.160
I know a lot of people who are quite proficient Neos users, but when I use vocabulary

146
0:11:02.160 --> 0:11:05.840
they're like that's not what you call that and I'm like it it literally is you can like

147
0:11:06.440 --> 0:11:13.400
Inspect to the thing and that's what it's called. So I don't know what you're saying. Like as an example, you should know what the words

148
0:11:14.040 --> 0:11:15.560
node

149
0:11:15.560 --> 0:11:17.440
interface card

150
0:11:17.440 --> 0:11:18.640
relay

151
0:11:18.640 --> 0:11:20.640
reference arrow drive

152
0:11:21.440 --> 0:11:22.640
impulse

153
0:11:22.640 --> 0:11:28.800
Ribbon, you know all these words mean an addition should also know what the word primary secondary in context means

154
0:11:28.800 --> 0:11:35.200
Everyone's like there's so many controls in here. So don't know which button to push about this three primary secondary in context with you

155
0:11:35.200 --> 0:11:36.880
That's it

156
0:11:36.880 --> 0:11:43.080
Primary secondary context. That's it. We technically is grab as well. But like grab is such a visceral one that people get it. I

157
0:11:43.760 --> 0:11:48.080
Don't know cuz like I haven't had any family close to my VR headsets in many years

158
0:11:48.080 --> 0:11:51.440
But I remember, you know trying to teach my mother to play Grand Theft Auto

159
0:11:51.480 --> 0:11:53.880
It's a funny story and you know

160
0:11:53.880 --> 0:11:57.460
There's tons of buttons on like an Xbox controller or whatever and she just doesn't know which one is to go

161
0:11:57.460 --> 0:12:01.540
And I'm like that one on the right hand side that feels like a trigger

162
0:12:01.780 --> 0:12:07.380
That will make you go and she got it right because it's such a tactile experience. I believe the same there is it's true for

163
0:12:07.380 --> 0:12:11.340
Grab, right? It's grab the controller and you grab stuff

164
0:12:12.140 --> 0:12:19.020
Yeah, primary secondary context menu grab those are the only things you need to learn in terms of controls and once you know those you

165
0:12:19.020 --> 0:12:20.940
Could also learn packing as well

166
0:12:20.940 --> 0:12:24.180
so many people like worry about like red prints and blueprints and

167
0:12:24.180 --> 0:12:29.260
orange prints and pink prints and whatever the hell else you want to call it pack and

168
0:12:29.740 --> 0:12:33.740
Unpack stuff just practice it make some shitty ball chicks that does absolutely nothing

169
0:12:33.820 --> 0:12:35.820
Like I don't know adds two numbers together

170
0:12:35.860 --> 0:12:41.420
Pack it into a box save the box geometry bring the box out unpack it do that like 17 times

171
0:12:41.420 --> 0:12:43.520
You'll never have questions about packing again

172
0:12:45.140 --> 0:12:50.140
If someone floats over in the middle of you learning logics and they're like, oh you can do that better another way if you use components

173
0:12:50.140 --> 0:12:55.020
Bap them on the face of a breadstick and tell them the prime told you that that's a bad thing to do

174
0:12:55.180 --> 0:12:57.620
Cuz I know it's not happening a lot. Well, you could do that better

175
0:12:58.020 --> 0:13:02.260
Oh one, please for those who are unaware. This is a bad thing to do

176
0:13:02.260 --> 0:13:07.020
If you are not editing the logics or helping someone with the logics

177
0:13:07.260 --> 0:13:13.140
Please do not insert your avatar into the logics. I've had people fall asleep inside my logics

178
0:13:13.140 --> 0:13:17.520
They come into the session. They hang out with me. They're chatting to me

179
0:13:17.520 --> 0:13:24.020
Parts of their avatar are intersecting my nodes and then they fall asleep and it's like, what are you doing?

180
0:13:24.940 --> 0:13:26.740
What are you doing?

181
0:13:26.740 --> 0:13:28.740
Get out of my logics

182
0:13:29.460 --> 0:13:34.820
All right, I gotta catch up questions rather than talking about either you stepping or learning logic some more. It's good luck

183
0:13:39.940 --> 0:13:41.940
Yeah, Ruthie has a question cool

184
0:13:41.940 --> 0:13:47.140
Or she says are there any automated methods for re-enabling those that have gone red in ham radio world?

185
0:13:47.140 --> 0:13:52.500
We're finding that web socket and downstream nodes are going red often with service inundated something like a world save or avatar loading

186
0:13:52.500 --> 0:13:55.540
I wonder if this way to reset without putting out the logics of finding

187
0:13:56.420 --> 0:14:03.180
There's no automated way to do it. There are ways to prevent it from happening. So usually those nodes would go red because

188
0:14:04.580 --> 0:14:09.020
There is an influx of data or the nodes being called too many times

189
0:14:09.020 --> 0:14:12.460
So and I know it sounds stupid, but just don't do that

190
0:14:12.820 --> 0:14:15.500
So like there are various ways to do that

191
0:14:15.620 --> 0:14:20.420
But you need to kind of figure out a way that will enable those nodes not to become swarmed

192
0:14:20.980 --> 0:14:27.300
something which you should remember when it comes to live data, which you mentioned via web sockets as well is that if the

193
0:14:27.900 --> 0:14:30.820
if the logic system is is struggling to keep up

194
0:14:31.460 --> 0:14:33.460
make sure that you know what the

195
0:14:33.460 --> 0:14:41.380
Lifetime or the like the lifetime of a single message coming through is as an example here that that is probably relevant

196
0:14:42.100 --> 0:14:46.500
When the heart rate system that uses web sockets it talks to a bluetooth heart rate monitor

197
0:14:46.500 --> 0:14:50.500
Which speaks your computer opens up a web socket server sends web socket messages to

198
0:14:50.500 --> 0:14:56.460
Neos and then you just like your heart rate in your name badge the size of like mount Vesuvius and I get really annoyed

199
0:14:56.460 --> 0:15:00.580
but anyway, your heart rates like the size of a mountain on top of your head and

200
0:15:00.580 --> 0:15:06.380
Every couple of seconds the web socket is going. Here's my heart rate. Here's my heart rate

201
0:15:06.380 --> 0:15:08.820
Here's my heart rate if you are struggling

202
0:15:09.540 --> 0:15:12.580
Or the no system is slowing down or whatever

203
0:15:12.580 --> 0:15:18.980
I'm like it's okay to skip some messages because you've always got the next message coming through that gives you information about

204
0:15:19.340 --> 0:15:22.940
What your heart rate is so you don't need to process every single message

205
0:15:22.940 --> 0:15:28.300
You just need to process as many messages as you can so there is an opportunity to drop some of the messages

206
0:15:28.300 --> 0:15:31.700
So do keep that in mind. We did that a lot during racing

207
0:15:32.220 --> 0:15:36.420
Of course like so I used to do racing software, and it's very complicated

208
0:15:37.580 --> 0:15:44.580
But so we had like a master controller, and it was running the race it knew who was first to a second etc

209
0:15:44.580 --> 0:15:51.500
But it would regularly send out those updates to view displays around sort of the race circuit and the track to be like you know

210
0:15:51.500 --> 0:15:55.300
this person's winning and those would get overloaded because sometimes this like

211
0:15:55.300 --> 0:16:01.460
300 bikes on track and it's really complicated and so we would drop packets right because we always knew the next

212
0:16:01.700 --> 0:16:06.300
Available status was coming out, so we would drop them and be like it's okay

213
0:16:06.300 --> 0:16:09.500
It can be invalid for like a split second whilst the next update comes

214
0:16:09.500 --> 0:16:13.620
Let's not stress out about like you know doing that we also see that

215
0:16:14.140 --> 0:16:18.340
Cmdr. Does that you know they drop frames OBS does that when you're streaming it drops frames, right?

216
0:16:18.340 --> 0:16:22.260
It's just like it's okay sometimes to just throw out some data if you don't need it moving onwards

217
0:16:22.260 --> 0:16:28.980
Deception says what's going on you're all currently in the office house ama from prime to ask about near stuff

218
0:16:28.980 --> 0:16:32.060
so ask some questions in the office hours channel that you're typing in and

219
0:16:32.780 --> 0:16:38.460
I'll answer them Gina says any plans for new logics knows a logical improvement. Yes

220
0:16:39.460 --> 0:16:41.260
but

221
0:16:41.260 --> 0:16:46.380
Rampers says and this is a pop to their previous questions, so that let's let's let's get into it

222
0:16:46.380 --> 0:16:53.260
Let's rub my hands together. I'm not sure exactly how to formulate this baby remember someone's saying something a lot along the sign along sort of

223
0:16:54.100 --> 0:16:55.860
Cool tongue-tied there

224
0:16:55.860 --> 0:17:01.900
Someone said something along the lines of I don't feel comfortable discussing this stuff you want to look for and

225
0:17:02.220 --> 0:17:04.260
Mod in modding discord do it in DM

226
0:17:04.260 --> 0:17:06.260
So don't get to problems or at least something like that

227
0:17:06.340 --> 0:17:11.660
What I say is I feel there should be some guidelines saying as long as you don't say too much about this you're not

228
0:17:11.660 --> 0:17:13.700
Okay, written by freaks himself disagree

229
0:17:13.700 --> 0:17:17.660
I'll answer that in a moment that essentially all hits back to the modding policy X you late

230
0:17:17.820 --> 0:17:20.500
Contradiction the thing that we discussed many times is how I feel about it ah

231
0:17:21.020 --> 0:17:25.540
Fricks doesn't have to write everything whenever you see the word fructs. I want you to replace it with Nias the company

232
0:17:25.540 --> 0:17:31.120
I know there's issues in announcements etc, but just replace it with Nias the company like seriously

233
0:17:31.120 --> 0:17:32.980
It's like well fructs needs to do that

234
0:17:32.980 --> 0:17:37.580
No, Nias the company needs to do that if fructs is actually the person that needs to do it fine

235
0:17:37.820 --> 0:17:40.340
But let's remove the word fructs from the vocabulary

236
0:17:40.340 --> 0:17:45.820
That's what we did when we wrote the modding policy the security policy all the rules all the guidelines etc

237
0:17:45.820 --> 0:17:51.160
Those are written by Nias the company or Nias's moderation team or prime

238
0:17:51.540 --> 0:17:57.620
Because it takes the emphasis off freaks needed to do everything right if I need to speak to fructs to get whatever I need written

239
0:17:57.620 --> 0:18:03.700
I will and he read and reviewed both the morning policy and the security policy before it was released to anyone

240
0:18:04.260 --> 0:18:06.860
That's totally fine. It doesn't need to be written by him

241
0:18:06.860 --> 0:18:10.260
That's I gotta be in my bonnet about that because it's like from the old days

242
0:18:10.260 --> 0:18:14.180
It was just like well fructs needs to do that. No anyone can do that

243
0:18:15.180 --> 0:18:17.180
Anyone can do that

244
0:18:19.460 --> 0:18:24.960
We can't do that till we resolve that eeler modding policy contradiction what I will say to you though is

245
0:18:25.580 --> 0:18:31.180
Maybe keep the morning discussion to the modding discord, and if it's in the modding discord. It's your guys's discord

246
0:18:31.180 --> 0:18:38.620
We have no purview to say don't do that there if we get reports or tickets about the EULA being contradicted over there

247
0:18:39.260 --> 0:18:46.640
It's I don't know what will happen because it's like off-platform and sort of out of our purview and the modding policy says it's okay

248
0:18:46.640 --> 0:18:49.780
To do but like I still don't understand the issue at play here

249
0:18:50.860 --> 0:18:56.540
People shouldn't feel that modding is bad or that modding is against the rules. We have a policy that says it. It's okay

250
0:18:56.540 --> 0:19:01.480
So just do it question mark. I don't understand. It's probably situational

251
0:19:02.420 --> 0:19:05.200
Depending on an individual thing just because I see

252
0:19:06.180 --> 0:19:10.460
Realms of a another topic here. I don't want to touch on it as well. I see like the oh

253
0:19:11.420 --> 0:19:17.140
There might be problems if we do this if you are worried about problems occurring because you do X ask

254
0:19:17.740 --> 0:19:22.480
Dropping a ticket. It's okay to drop in a ticket and be like I am going to blow up the moon

255
0:19:22.480 --> 0:19:29.520
Will I be modded you know have mod restrictions against be on on Neos if I do that perfectly okay ticket go for it

256
0:19:29.880 --> 0:19:34.240
Let us know what you're worried about. I can't stand people saying like oh, yeah guys

257
0:19:34.240 --> 0:19:39.160
There's rumors and the rumors are bad the last time someone said that to me

258
0:19:39.160 --> 0:19:44.520
We took it to DMS, and I'm like those aren't rumors and none of them are bad or security related at all

259
0:19:45.240 --> 0:19:47.240
So just just keep that in mind

260
0:19:47.240 --> 0:19:54.200
So recio now says what method would you recommend for dropping those sets of impulses off the web socket receiver local impulse timeout?

261
0:19:54.200 --> 0:19:57.720
Yeah, probably local impulse timeout. You could also use some sort of queuing system

262
0:19:58.400 --> 0:20:00.400
which of course you need collections for but

263
0:20:01.320 --> 0:20:03.320
local impulse timeout once per frame

264
0:20:05.200 --> 0:20:10.200
Local leaky impulse bucket I have to say that very carefully because some friends of mine have a

265
0:20:11.480 --> 0:20:13.520
less than professional nickname for it

266
0:20:13.520 --> 0:20:15.520
I

267
0:20:16.320 --> 0:20:18.320
Would speak of

268
0:20:19.360 --> 0:20:25.240
You could also look at like how often the data gets duplicated from your end on the server as well

269
0:20:25.560 --> 0:20:29.360
So if your server is constantly sending the same data every like second

270
0:20:29.560 --> 0:20:36.240
Maybe up it to every two seconds, and then you've you've you've halved your data load right you've half the bandwidth also consider polling as well

271
0:20:36.240 --> 0:20:40.920
I've noticed tonight. I don't know anything about your scenario, so I don't know if this is the case, but I've noticed a lot of people

272
0:20:40.920 --> 0:20:47.640
Confuse HTTP nodes and web sockets, and they're just like you have to use web sockets for everything, and I'm like no no

273
0:20:48.880 --> 0:20:54.360
Like the world uses HTTP. We don't all use web sockets a good example here might be

274
0:20:55.560 --> 0:21:00.800
Let's think about let's think about discord actually so when you load discord first thing in the morning

275
0:21:01.440 --> 0:21:03.440
And I'm not sure exactly works like this

276
0:21:03.440 --> 0:21:07.300
But hey this is how I would do it when you first load discord in the morning

277
0:21:07.300 --> 0:21:12.960
It will do a HTTP request to discord and say give me the history of the office hours channel

278
0:21:12.960 --> 0:21:16.800
And you'll get all that history down and then when you're connected and you're synced up

279
0:21:17.600 --> 0:21:23.940
To that it'll then use web sockets or something similar to that to get new messages so they get them live

280
0:21:24.220 --> 0:21:29.220
But it's constantly doing HTTP requests right it's like everyone's like no. I got a bit of sockets

281
0:21:29.220 --> 0:21:33.260
I'm like well, just just just trust me here HTTP sometimes better

282
0:21:33.260 --> 0:21:38.960
Moving forwards deception ask what's new is his favorite food. I don't know you'd have to ask news

283
0:21:40.240 --> 0:21:42.240
Dre says some time ago

284
0:21:42.280 --> 0:21:45.720
I was accidentally crashed out you to unload video play again deleted

285
0:21:45.720 --> 0:21:50.160
I'm home with crash force news to say for changes and all the untidy mess at my home world in that point in time

286
0:21:50.160 --> 0:21:52.360
There's a way to prevent the forced over saving in case one of the crash

287
0:21:53.800 --> 0:21:59.360
Not currently um I do have some recommendations, which are don't use your home worlds

288
0:21:59.360 --> 0:22:02.600
I know that sounds kind of strange, but like I don't use them

289
0:22:02.600 --> 0:22:05.800
My home was a jump points. I've got like

290
0:22:06.600 --> 0:22:09.520
World orbs to various projects. I'm doing all sorts of stuff like that

291
0:22:09.520 --> 0:22:12.320
I do that to avoid the problem that currently exists

292
0:22:12.320 --> 0:22:19.000
We do have some open get up issues about sort of what to do their settings. Maybe tweaks settings

293
0:22:19.760 --> 0:22:21.760
Conflict stuff like that that might help

294
0:22:22.240 --> 0:22:29.080
But until then I just I don't recommend using them like my home world is literally like how to get to somewhere else quicker or

295
0:22:29.080 --> 0:22:33.680
The space which I like hang out in last I'm waiting to join another world

296
0:22:34.400 --> 0:22:38.080
You can even like put something in your home world which is like a big button

297
0:22:38.240 --> 0:22:43.140
That's like open my actual like hangout world right and then when you don't you're just like

298
0:22:43.240 --> 0:22:49.740
Click the button opens the world does it all for you and that way you're not right really missing any of the stuff like that

299
0:22:50.080 --> 0:22:54.820
You know I've got like two bookshelves left bookshelf is in progress right bookshelf is

300
0:22:55.520 --> 0:22:57.520
finished but sort of reference

301
0:22:57.520 --> 0:22:59.580
There has been like a

302
0:23:00.280 --> 0:23:02.000
Roman amphitheater

303
0:23:02.000 --> 0:23:03.320
style thing

304
0:23:03.320 --> 0:23:07.760
About 20 units to the right of where my home world starts for about a year now

305
0:23:07.760 --> 0:23:10.360
And I just keep forgetting to leave it that just leaves there

306
0:23:10.360 --> 0:23:14.280
I was gonna make it into a world, but then I kept forgetting and now it's just kind of there. It's strange

307
0:23:14.280 --> 0:23:16.120
I don't really know why I

308
0:23:16.120 --> 0:23:18.120
forgotten to do it, but

309
0:23:20.720 --> 0:23:22.840
Yeah, it's something like like like this

310
0:23:22.840 --> 0:23:28.760
But it's just like sat there in my whole world somewhere and just sat there doing nothing

311
0:23:29.960 --> 0:23:33.180
Moving forward so Risi has more information about the web socket stuff

312
0:23:33.800 --> 0:23:38.480
The you're doing it to get the RF level okay cool any changes from the server are sent

313
0:23:38.480 --> 0:23:41.640
But they're sending a maximum of 20 updates per second is kind of important to receive this many updates

314
0:23:41.640 --> 0:23:46.280
We can get real-time information on what we are receiving to the other end of the radio connected in real life. Yeah, um

315
0:23:46.960 --> 0:23:49.400
At that point. I probably just have to look at the node set up

316
0:23:49.400 --> 0:23:55.720
There's probably something you're doing somewhere that can be improved to prevent red nodes. There's a particular area. That's reading out

317
0:23:56.120 --> 0:24:03.220
Think about how you can restructure it such that the data coming in from the web sockets is isolated from the rest of the system

318
0:24:04.000 --> 0:24:09.080
For example you might write that RF level to a dynamic variable and then pick it up elsewhere

319
0:24:09.080 --> 0:24:15.560
And then you've like you've ended your impulse chain very quickly like you received the RF level you write it to a dynamic variable

320
0:24:15.560 --> 0:24:20.920
You're done. You're done, and then nothing else happens in that particular impulse chain. That's another thing

321
0:24:20.920 --> 0:24:23.900
I want people to do when they learn logics as well as pack early and

322
0:24:24.480 --> 0:24:29.200
Impulse chains early like it's always better to have more than one impulse chain than have an impulse chain

323
0:24:29.200 --> 0:24:30.800
That is like the size of the planet

324
0:24:30.800 --> 0:24:34.280
It's like and then we do this and then we do that and then we do this and then we do that and then

325
0:24:34.280 --> 0:24:36.280
We do this and then we do that okay

326
0:24:36.600 --> 0:24:40.220
Maybe just like chuck in a dynamic impulse receiver in the middle there

327
0:24:40.220 --> 0:24:42.320
So you don't have to like keep doing stuff on the same chain

328
0:24:42.320 --> 0:24:48.440
Another good way to look at it is when people talk about sort of multi-threaded asynchronous programming things like that

329
0:24:48.440 --> 0:24:49.160
They're very complicated

330
0:24:49.160 --> 0:24:56.440
But just think about it this way if there is a break as in between impulse chains it gives time for the computer to like

331
0:24:56.440 --> 0:24:59.440
Catch up right so you're doing hey. I'm doing this impulse chain

332
0:24:59.440 --> 0:25:05.880
I'm gonna stop and immediately trigger using whatever method you want to trigger another impulse chain cool

333
0:25:06.040 --> 0:25:08.160
But in the split second between one impulse chain

334
0:25:08.160 --> 0:25:13.640
Finishing and another impulse chain starting it gives chance for the logics engine to be like ah cool

335
0:25:13.640 --> 0:25:16.760
I can relax a little bit. I can chill out right so it's a more

336
0:25:17.560 --> 0:25:22.880
Uncommon to see red nodes in that case properties providing some information about dot opening the cloud home

337
0:25:22.880 --> 0:25:25.920
I like that I use it because it's like has lots of links in it

338
0:25:25.920 --> 0:25:30.720
But I don't put video players or anything like that, and it's like a mirror and some world orbs

339
0:25:32.760 --> 0:25:35.280
Moving forward to other questions just check you haven't missed any

340
0:25:35.280 --> 0:25:40.680
Specs has a question here speaking of home was I'll try to set my local headless server as a session

341
0:25:40.680 --> 0:25:42.120
I auto-join when I start up nears

342
0:25:42.120 --> 0:25:44.600
I tried using the documented command line parameters

343
0:25:44.600 --> 0:25:51.640
But didn't seem to have any luck to have a working example of what using auto-join parameters looks like I don't have an example

344
0:25:51.760 --> 0:25:57.240
I would highly recommend using the custom session ID stuff for headless

345
0:25:57.760 --> 0:26:02.600
Because that's really cool, and that should be a little bit easier to launch into but I don't have a specific example

346
0:26:02.600 --> 0:26:08.760
Ozi has a question which is a good question is a nice way to write is there a nice write-up on how nears is data

347
0:26:08.760 --> 0:26:12.280
Model works during how nears think things that the players know

348
0:26:12.680 --> 0:26:17.080
I know the hate tree was working in one for like how logics works which is kind of interesting

349
0:26:17.080 --> 0:26:19.840
But that I don't think they buy published it yet. They're still working on it

350
0:26:20.280 --> 0:26:21.280
I

351
0:26:21.280 --> 0:26:22.400
want to

352
0:26:22.400 --> 0:26:24.680
Hate mentioning this again, but I do want to caution people

353
0:26:25.800 --> 0:26:27.800
Some of that stuff should be invisible to you

354
0:26:27.800 --> 0:26:33.720
Like if there's like a lot of times feel like you know how do I use like an I feel?

355
0:26:33.760 --> 0:26:39.280
Bracket sync ref bracket sync bracket sync sync sync, and I'm just like what are you doing stop?

356
0:26:39.680 --> 0:26:45.880
Like you shouldn't use that lower level part of the engine you should use something above that to do what you need to do

357
0:26:46.880 --> 0:26:48.080
and

358
0:26:48.080 --> 0:26:51.920
That can be a case there when you're looking too much into the data model and how it works

359
0:26:51.920 --> 0:26:57.680
like if there is a problem, that's a better question, so I'm just making sure that that question doesn't hide a

360
0:26:58.080 --> 0:27:05.080
Problem behind that question, and if it doesn't that's totally fine, but if it does make sure you're asking the question the course

361
0:27:05.080 --> 0:27:11.520
The chain of thought to lead up to generally how the data model works because you shouldn't ideally need to know how it works

362
0:27:11.960 --> 0:27:13.160
moving down to

363
0:27:13.160 --> 0:27:19.000
Gina what logics projects you want to see people make more of I want you see people make more of not multi tools

364
0:27:19.000 --> 0:27:24.400
Not avatar gesture systems if you're making anything other than those two things

365
0:27:25.080 --> 0:27:27.080
Fantastic just go ahead and do it

366
0:27:27.720 --> 0:27:29.000
games

367
0:27:29.000 --> 0:27:31.000
experiences artwork

368
0:27:31.000 --> 0:27:33.000
science

369
0:27:33.200 --> 0:27:35.200
Data visualization

370
0:27:35.960 --> 0:27:40.900
All sorts of stuff like that. I don't need to see another multi-tool

371
0:27:41.360 --> 0:27:46.760
Don't build blueprints either. I see what a lot of people do is they're making tools to make stuff like I am making

372
0:27:46.760 --> 0:27:51.960
a hammer to hammer some nails and making a screwdriver to screw in some screws

373
0:27:52.080 --> 0:27:58.120
What I want to see is what are you building? Oh, I'm building a bird box great. I want to see more bird boxes

374
0:27:58.120 --> 0:28:02.440
I don't want to see more hammers if that makes sense those tools are great, but I

375
0:28:03.160 --> 0:28:07.000
I've lost count of the amount of people that join my session, and they're like hey prime

376
0:28:07.000 --> 0:28:09.680
Can I show you the multi-tool? I'm working on and I just go

377
0:28:10.880 --> 0:28:12.880
No

378
0:28:12.880 --> 0:28:17.160
Hard to not be rude about it, but like I've seen enough. I don't need to see any more multi-tools. Thanks

379
0:28:17.840 --> 0:28:21.040
Rosie follows up this is it's just curiosity because I know how half it works

380
0:28:21.960 --> 0:28:24.960
Yeah, understood. Yeah, I'm just making sure sometimes

381
0:28:24.960 --> 0:28:29.320
I've seen people that are like how does logics work or like how does locomotion work?

382
0:28:29.320 --> 0:28:32.080
And then I ask them some more questions, and I find out there

383
0:28:32.200 --> 0:28:37.960
They're trying to do something that's that's solved with a logic node or a component that they haven't realized exists

384
0:28:38.640 --> 0:28:40.640
moving forwards to dresus question

385
0:28:40.640 --> 0:28:42.800
other way anyways in

386
0:28:43.920 --> 0:28:49.680
Logics to essentially take your rotation of a bone and tell another bone to imitate the rotation and use some multiply map to tell

387
0:28:49.680 --> 0:28:52.880
It to use any part of the rotation. Yes. I don't know it though um

388
0:28:53.600 --> 0:28:56.840
We have a full mathematical engine for quaternions

389
0:28:56.840 --> 0:29:02.760
We also have some shortcut mathematics like look rotation inverse rotation from to rotation axis angle stuff like that

390
0:29:02.760 --> 0:29:05.520
But it's all hardcore maths you need to understand the maths about it

391
0:29:05.520 --> 0:29:09.840
a good example here being and I do this on a 2d plane just because

392
0:29:10.240 --> 0:29:17.600
2d is what I know I was once many many many years ago making a 2d space shooter. You know and

393
0:29:18.240 --> 0:29:21.600
The enemy ship was going to fire a missile at the player ship

394
0:29:22.080 --> 0:29:22.920
And I'm like well

395
0:29:22.920 --> 0:29:28.840
how do I make the missile rotate such that it faces the the player ship and then moves towards it and

396
0:29:29.400 --> 0:29:34.080
I'm like oh, let's figure this out. Let's try and do it, and I did lots of research, and I figured out hey

397
0:29:34.080 --> 0:29:39.000
It's just maths the a 10 to operator will do that for you it will

398
0:29:39.840 --> 0:29:42.520
Take the I never remember how to use I have to look it up every time

399
0:29:42.520 --> 0:29:44.480
I know like I just google a 10 to I'll figure it out

400
0:29:44.480 --> 0:29:49.480
But you get the x and y of a thingy and you plug it in and it gives you an angle

401
0:29:49.480 --> 0:29:55.320
And then you rotate the ship to the angle or the missile to angle and it's aimed directly at the player

402
0:29:55.320 --> 0:30:00.640
And then you move it there. That's a good example where I'm just like cool. That's that's all my problem thumbs up

403
0:30:01.000 --> 0:30:03.000
That's sold my problem

404
0:30:03.000 --> 0:30:05.120
gun Griffin or Kip says a

405
0:30:06.240 --> 0:30:09.360
Note to self make a bird box hammer. Yeah, remember the there's a

406
0:30:10.200 --> 0:30:15.920
Diy sort of like wooden furniture world that was one of the MMC entries. That's beautiful right? That's a good example

407
0:30:16.320 --> 0:30:20.440
Hey, there's lots of stuff. You can do there if you made like just

408
0:30:21.720 --> 0:30:27.520
Like a two by four with nails that you could hammer in and then maybe a ray-set button that brings the nails back up

409
0:30:27.520 --> 0:30:32.440
To their non hammered in height. I love that lots of people do I like that people like the tactile tools

410
0:30:32.440 --> 0:30:33.640
you can make and

411
0:30:33.640 --> 0:30:37.840
With that or actually over time by a lot so rampa and kip if you have a question

412
0:30:37.840 --> 0:30:40.760
Please feel free to finish typing otherwise no more questions

413
0:30:41.800 --> 0:30:44.200
Okay, we have too many work two more questions

414
0:30:44.760 --> 0:30:50.320
So rampa says is it possible to create a copy button on a user-made creation?

415
0:30:50.920 --> 0:30:54.800
Facet world copy is in clipboard copy it is

416
0:30:55.520 --> 0:30:57.820
People do it kind of in a hacky way they use

417
0:30:57.820 --> 0:31:03.180
the light control C control V multi-key thing

418
0:31:03.580 --> 0:31:07.820
Where basically they fake it like it's one of our keyboards, but it isn't one of our keyboards

419
0:31:08.020 --> 0:31:11.740
There is like a problem in that because it's sort of

420
0:31:12.460 --> 0:31:15.260
difficult to do understand and explain

421
0:31:16.180 --> 0:31:20.580
I'd like to see a way to do it that had like maybe you know a defined way of doing it

422
0:31:20.580 --> 0:31:22.900
We could also put more security into that way for example

423
0:31:22.900 --> 0:31:30.180
like we could have a saying allow logics to access my clipboard which would default to off because that sounds like a terrible move or

424
0:31:30.420 --> 0:31:35.700
Maybe like it defaults to only allow like put stuff in your clipboard, but it can't read the clipboard

425
0:31:35.700 --> 0:31:39.680
I don't know if we put a system in place that was more controlled there. We can add

426
0:31:40.260 --> 0:31:44.900
protections around that but yeah right now virtual multi-key control C control V

427
0:31:44.900 --> 0:31:49.380
It's difficult usually need to do control a control C control V

428
0:31:49.380 --> 0:31:53.940
Take a look at any of the cloud spawners that exist. I believe there's one in red print

429
0:31:54.220 --> 0:31:57.660
it's one in a bunch of the the JP stuff and

430
0:31:58.940 --> 0:32:02.700
It's not like backpack thing the JP have I forget what it's called

431
0:32:02.700 --> 0:32:06.780
I'm actually sort of have like a radio menu that can spawn stuff from a public folder. It's cool

432
0:32:08.940 --> 0:32:11.660
moving onwards to the next question

433
0:32:12.660 --> 0:32:16.980
In an effort to make a robust mesh to mesh touch detection system

434
0:32:16.980 --> 0:32:22.340
Can you sample the color of a pixel on an intersect material to detect if a mesh is intersecting near it?

435
0:32:23.340 --> 0:32:25.340
I don't know

436
0:32:25.420 --> 0:32:28.060
That appears to be what I call the empirical question

437
0:32:28.060 --> 0:32:34.980
Which is please go ahead and try it and let me know what your result is I think it should work

438
0:32:35.380 --> 0:32:40.460
But like I'm not sure what you're trying to do, so I probably wouldn't like say do that depends

439
0:32:40.460 --> 0:32:45.220
What you're trying to do like I'm then seeing Ozi respond with like hey use cameras

440
0:32:45.220 --> 0:32:49.940
And like if you're just trying to collide why not like use colliders

441
0:32:50.300 --> 0:32:53.900
How do people not use colliders? Yeah deformed mesh?

442
0:32:54.660 --> 0:32:57.100
Collider probably might not match up sometimes

443
0:32:57.700 --> 0:33:04.220
So to break it to you there like you're never going to get like a mesh collider with a deformed mesh working correctly

444
0:33:04.780 --> 0:33:08.340
I would strongly recommend you go after the

445
0:33:08.900 --> 0:33:11.740
procedural colliders which are placed within an avatar's hierarchy

446
0:33:11.740 --> 0:33:15.540
And if it's a custom mesh with a rig add to those procedural meshes

447
0:33:16.180 --> 0:33:19.620
So a good example is if you look at your hand your hand as a box collider on it

448
0:33:19.620 --> 0:33:23.820
Which represents the sort of square that is your hand your arm has a cylinder on it because it's a cylinder

449
0:33:23.940 --> 0:33:28.560
And that is what you should be colliding with you shouldn't be colliding with the actual mesh that is

450
0:33:29.100 --> 0:33:33.380
fraught with difficulties if you want to use a camera with that or

451
0:33:33.380 --> 0:33:41.380
The sample color node of it good luck. I think it'll work. I would just question the the sanity in doing that so

452
0:33:41.980 --> 0:33:49.020
Last question at all from from dre says it's possible to have a custom spawn point for your an avatar or work around to

453
0:33:49.020 --> 0:33:51.020
Make it seem like you spawned on your desired point

454
0:33:51.980 --> 0:33:57.880
Yeah, you can do like if you do like on like go to flow events and then use on start

455
0:33:57.880 --> 0:34:04.320
On start it gets triggered when the like the system that you're loading in like avatar object

456
0:34:04.320 --> 0:34:06.600
Whatever like starts up like it's a defined event

457
0:34:07.040 --> 0:34:12.440
And so you can trigger on star and then I would wait like I don't know a second or two and then teleport yourself

458
0:34:12.560 --> 0:34:14.600
I would question again

459
0:34:14.600 --> 0:34:18.040
Why you need to do that usually when you load into a map the spawn point that you're given is

460
0:34:18.320 --> 0:34:23.620
Tailored to the the map creator good example here being if you're in I don't know a parkour map

461
0:34:23.760 --> 0:34:26.700
You would want the player to spawn at the start of the parkour

462
0:34:26.700 --> 0:34:29.740
Map and not at the end of the parkour map

463
0:34:35.500 --> 0:34:41.980
Yeah, you could if you're just teleporting to someone just just teleport to them just jump to them you can even put like

464
0:34:42.140 --> 0:34:44.140
this is a great example of

465
0:34:44.980 --> 0:34:50.140
The xy problem, so we'll go over a little bit more to explain it so your problem dres was

466
0:34:50.140 --> 0:34:56.740
Losing friends in a world and your solution was change spawn point. You should have asked about your problem

467
0:34:56.740 --> 0:35:02.180
Which is getting back to friends in the world rather than your intended solution, which has changed spawn point

468
0:35:02.380 --> 0:35:08.740
So now that we know that your actual problem is losing friends. There are better ways to do that which are

469
0:35:09.700 --> 0:35:16.380
The jump menu in the session menu or a context menu or whatever you want inside your actual avatar

470
0:35:16.380 --> 0:35:22.300
Which will give a list of players in the session and teleport you to them like you can make a custom context menu

471
0:35:22.300 --> 0:35:27.420
Which does you know a ring of all the players in a session and then when you click on that button it can teleport you

472
0:35:27.420 --> 0:35:29.420
To that's that's quite easy to do yeah

473
0:35:29.980 --> 0:35:33.620
They will they want to jump to us. You know a point not on top of your friend

474
0:35:33.820 --> 0:35:37.100
You'll probably want to take the position of your friend

475
0:35:37.460 --> 0:35:42.200
Go out a radius from that and teleport to there and so you take the position of the friend you

476
0:35:42.200 --> 0:35:47.640
Add a radius to that and then you teleport to that you again. You can do that with maths

477
0:35:47.640 --> 0:35:49.960
I would probably take their

478
0:35:51.000 --> 0:35:57.060
Their position and then add their left or right vector to it and a little bit

479
0:35:57.060 --> 0:35:59.460
And that will make you spawn to the left or right of them

480
0:36:00.080 --> 0:36:04.440
By a little bit you'd also do forward or back, and then you'll appear in front of them or behind them

481
0:36:04.440 --> 0:36:07.960
Which is both scary hence why it's just left or right because then that's not scary

482
0:36:07.960 --> 0:36:14.840
I need to do more videos on the the left right up down toward backwards nodes because they're amazing and no one uses them

483
0:36:15.320 --> 0:36:18.720
We are totally out of time, so I'm gonna go ahead and kill things off here

484
0:36:18.880 --> 0:36:20.860
