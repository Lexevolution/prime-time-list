0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.360
So welcome to office hours. This is the half hour, sometimes an hour, sometimes 45 minute segment.

2
0:00:05.920 --> 0:00:09.840
Depends how long we are on the questions, where I answer your guys's questions,

3
0:00:09.920 --> 0:00:12.720
whatever you want to ask, up in the office hours text chat.

4
0:00:12.720 --> 0:00:15.920
So go ahead and drop those questions in there, and I'll get to them as soon as I can.

5
0:00:16.400 --> 0:00:21.760
No main announcements today or anything like that, so we'll just get straight into questions.

6
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:26.320
We have a big question from Specs. Thank you for a big question.

7
0:00:26.320 --> 0:00:30.640
I will skip over some of your message here, so we'll just get to the actual questions.

8
0:00:30.640 --> 0:00:33.360
But I will read them out for the benefits of the recording.

9
0:00:33.360 --> 0:00:36.000
I'm also going to like cough or hiccup, just give me a second here.

10
0:00:36.000 --> 0:00:39.440
Okay, that's better. I just did like all the mouth noises at once whilst muted.

11
0:00:40.640 --> 0:00:45.920
So Specs asks, beside network latency stroke reliability, is there any reason mounting

12
0:00:45.920 --> 0:00:51.600
a Neos cache on a network drive like an NFS or SMB share wouldn't work or might cause problems?

13
0:00:51.600 --> 0:00:58.000
Um, it depends on like how those things handle the ownership of those files.

14
0:00:58.000 --> 0:01:04.880
I have seen issues with other applications, not Neos, where when I, I think I was running

15
0:01:04.880 --> 0:01:09.600
like a Node.js program inside a folder that was being synced by Google Drive,

16
0:01:09.600 --> 0:01:11.200
which is a terrible idea, don't do that.

17
0:01:12.000 --> 0:01:14.960
Node was just like, oh my god, I hate you.

18
0:01:14.960 --> 0:01:17.680
And Google Drive was like, I know, I hate you too.

19
0:01:17.680 --> 0:01:21.760
Uh, so that's the only thing I can think of that would cause a problem.

20
0:01:21.760 --> 0:01:25.040
I'm not sure why you would share the cache though.

21
0:01:25.040 --> 0:01:29.920
Like the cache really is just meant to be like junk temporary data.

22
0:01:29.920 --> 0:01:33.920
If you mean like the data directory and not the cache directory, then maybe,

23
0:01:35.040 --> 0:01:36.960
maybe that might be worth it.

24
0:01:36.960 --> 0:01:38.000
I don't know though.

25
0:01:38.000 --> 0:01:40.640
That's really the only thing I can think of is like file contention.

26
0:01:40.640 --> 0:01:46.320
Um, you know, if NFS or SMB are like, this file's changed, I'll change it whilst Neos is going,

27
0:01:46.320 --> 0:01:51.200
but I'm changing it, mommy, you can't change it without me changing it first.

28
0:01:51.200 --> 0:01:53.120
Then you'll end up with the problems.

29
0:01:53.120 --> 0:01:56.320
I'll move on to the second question, which is bigger question in bold.

30
0:01:56.320 --> 0:01:57.280
Interesting.

31
0:01:57.280 --> 0:02:01.680
This is, would you also be able to have several headless servers of any kind of Neos client

32
0:02:01.680 --> 0:02:06.160
share a network storage for a centralized cache, allowing for shared cache across say

33
0:02:06.160 --> 0:02:07.600
a household machine that runs Neos?

34
0:02:07.600 --> 0:02:09.360
No, no, don't do that.

35
0:02:09.360 --> 0:02:15.200
Um, so the cache is, um, like again, it's meant to just be temporary files that, uh,

36
0:02:15.200 --> 0:02:16.800
can be thrown away if necessary.

37
0:02:16.800 --> 0:02:18.960
You shouldn't be syncing them across multiple clients.

38
0:02:18.960 --> 0:02:23.440
I know that that seems like it would save space and stuff like that.

39
0:02:23.440 --> 0:02:28.240
Um, but I think at that point where you've got multiple copies going, um, they'd probably

40
0:02:28.240 --> 0:02:33.280
fight each other, uh, you know, uh, uh, as an example here, let's say both servers just

41
0:02:33.280 --> 0:02:35.200
happened to load the same user.

42
0:02:35.200 --> 0:02:37.280
So I don't know, Mr.

43
0:02:37.280 --> 0:02:37.600
Mr.

44
0:02:37.600 --> 0:02:43.280
Pro will prime and his into a headless session on both of those servers within a couple of

45
0:02:43.280 --> 0:02:49.040
minutes or whatever, perhaps, um, both servers would then be trying to write the cache of

46
0:02:49.040 --> 0:02:51.200
my texture at the same time.

47
0:02:51.200 --> 0:02:52.560
And they would just fight.

48
0:02:52.560 --> 0:02:56.160
Uh, I don't know how that would work out.

49
0:02:56.160 --> 0:02:58.080
Certainly not something that we have programmed for.

50
0:02:58.080 --> 0:02:58.960
So it might work.

51
0:02:58.960 --> 0:03:00.160
It might not work.

52
0:03:00.160 --> 0:03:01.040
Feel free to try it.

53
0:03:01.040 --> 0:03:03.360
I don't know why you would, but there we go.

54
0:03:03.360 --> 0:03:05.440
Moving towards to Haz's question.

55
0:03:05.440 --> 0:03:09.040
I was wondering if there's a Wiki page that lists all the supported protocols, strict

56
0:03:09.040 --> 0:03:11.520
formats that the Neos video player supports.

57
0:03:11.520 --> 0:03:19.360
Uh, yeah, so we use, uh, YouTube, uh, YouTube DL dash P or something.

58
0:03:19.360 --> 0:03:22.560
It's like, like, Oh, it's YouTube dash DLP.

59
0:03:23.200 --> 0:03:28.080
Um, YouTube, it's just like DLP.

60
0:03:28.080 --> 0:03:28.560
Oh yeah.

61
0:03:28.560 --> 0:03:29.760
That's what they call it.

62
0:03:29.760 --> 0:03:35.760
Um, so anything that's, uh, that supported here should theoretically work.

63
0:03:35.760 --> 0:03:42.320
Um, but, uh, I can't find easily because this is like the most complicated thing ever.

64
0:03:42.320 --> 0:03:46.000
It's like the best library ever, but also incredibly complicated.

65
0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:50.480
I can't easily find the supported, uh, doobly-doos for it.

66
0:03:50.480 --> 0:03:51.520
Supported doobly-doos.

67
0:03:51.520 --> 0:03:51.760
Yes.

68
0:03:51.760 --> 0:03:52.560
That is a phrase.

69
0:03:54.560 --> 0:03:55.040
I don't know.

70
0:03:55.040 --> 0:03:56.720
There's a list somewhere on that page.

71
0:03:56.720 --> 0:03:59.760
It's like one of the longest read me files I've seen in a long time.

72
0:03:59.760 --> 0:04:01.360
But, uh, take a look at that.

73
0:04:01.360 --> 0:04:04.160
Uh, sometimes we need to add additional options to that.

74
0:04:04.160 --> 0:04:05.920
Uh, Oh, there we go.

75
0:04:05.920 --> 0:04:07.200
Alex has got it for us.

76
0:04:07.200 --> 0:04:08.080
Thank you.

77
0:04:08.080 --> 0:04:11.920
Sometimes we need to add additional settings to some of those so that they actually work.

78
0:04:11.920 --> 0:04:14.800
Uh, I seem to remember Pico live being a thing.

79
0:04:14.800 --> 0:04:18.800
Um, I haven't opened the code base yet, so I'll get that opening and take a look where

80
0:04:18.800 --> 0:04:21.840
that code is and maybe I can get a list and add a Wiki page or some kind.

81
0:04:21.840 --> 0:04:26.560
And then one of it, uh, no, no, uh, has, uh, YouTube DLP does a bunch of stuff.

82
0:04:26.560 --> 0:04:31.280
Like I know, I seem to remember it as Pico that we did it or as Picato or something.

83
0:04:31.280 --> 0:04:31.920
Yeah, Picato.

84
0:04:31.920 --> 0:04:32.720
That's the one.

85
0:04:32.720 --> 0:04:36.960
Um, Picato is like a stream platform usually used more for artistic purposes.

86
0:04:36.960 --> 0:04:38.560
So you get lots of people doing art there.

87
0:04:38.560 --> 0:04:44.000
I know people do art on Twitch too, but, uh, Picato is kind of set up to be, um, more of

88
0:04:44.000 --> 0:04:45.040
an art community.

89
0:04:45.040 --> 0:04:47.200
So we had to do something to make Picato work.

90
0:04:47.200 --> 0:04:52.320
And then I think we also had to do something to make a couple of, um, Eastern streaming

91
0:04:52.320 --> 0:04:53.840
platforms work as well.

92
0:04:53.840 --> 0:04:55.680
Uh, let us move forwards.

93
0:04:56.240 --> 0:04:57.760
Uh, UKS is full body work.

94
0:04:57.760 --> 0:04:58.640
Full body does work.

95
0:04:58.640 --> 0:04:59.200
Yes.

96
0:04:59.200 --> 0:05:00.080
Next question.

97
0:05:00.080 --> 0:05:04.320
Uh, Kintron says, I've noticed some video players spawned from TikTok links refused

98
0:05:04.320 --> 0:05:06.560
to load the issue of TikTok platform.

99
0:05:06.560 --> 0:05:08.480
Most likely TikTok platform.

100
0:05:08.480 --> 0:05:09.360
Yep.

101
0:05:09.360 --> 0:05:12.160
So, uh, I don't really know what to do about that.

102
0:05:12.160 --> 0:05:13.760
I'd probably have to get a log file.

103
0:05:13.760 --> 0:05:16.560
Um, maybe open up actually a GitHub issue for that.

104
0:05:16.560 --> 0:05:19.280
It'll be good to sort of track any platforms that don't work.

105
0:05:19.280 --> 0:05:22.000
Even if you think that they, you know, if you think that they should, and then they

106
0:05:22.000 --> 0:05:26.400
don't go ahead and open one up, you'll probably search the issue list for Picato and see that.

107
0:05:26.400 --> 0:05:28.880
Cause I'm quite, I might be misremembering.

108
0:05:28.880 --> 0:05:32.960
It was a long time ago, but I think we had an issue, um, with Picato.

109
0:05:32.960 --> 0:05:34.160
That was a GitHub issue.

110
0:05:34.160 --> 0:05:36.560
And then, um, it got fixed.

111
0:05:36.560 --> 0:05:37.040
Let me see.

112
0:05:38.960 --> 0:05:39.200
Sure.

113
0:05:39.200 --> 0:05:39.840
It was an issue.

114
0:05:40.400 --> 0:05:45.920
Uh, tell you what, I'm going to find in files through the entire Neo source code for Picato.

115
0:05:45.920 --> 0:05:46.960
Matched none.

116
0:05:46.960 --> 0:05:47.200
Okay.

117
0:05:48.560 --> 0:05:51.200
Might actually be in the unity, um, project.

118
0:05:51.200 --> 0:05:53.120
Let's go ahead and take a look at that one.

119
0:05:53.120 --> 0:05:59.840
Uh, that will be up a folder from here into there and then search differently.

120
0:05:59.840 --> 0:06:00.400
No, no, no.

121
0:06:00.400 --> 0:06:06.080
Um, I'm, I'm, I'm using Picato as like a case study for, um, something that we fixed.

122
0:06:06.080 --> 0:06:12.560
Uh, and so if you want to get, uh, TikTok fixed, uh, maybe look for how we got Picato

123
0:06:12.560 --> 0:06:16.800
fixed or who reported Picato being broken or that, I don't think we've got any additional

124
0:06:16.800 --> 0:06:17.280
questions.

125
0:06:17.280 --> 0:06:23.200
So if I look for the video player code and do that scene, there's no questions.

126
0:06:23.200 --> 0:06:24.800
If a question appears, I'll get to it.

127
0:06:24.800 --> 0:06:28.720
I'm just going to tab back to the question list every now and then.

128
0:06:28.720 --> 0:06:29.600
Make sure I don't miss it.

129
0:06:29.600 --> 0:06:32.320
Whilst I'm basically just reading Neo source code.

130
0:06:32.320 --> 0:06:34.080
Uh, video texture provider.

131
0:06:34.080 --> 0:06:34.560
Yup.

132
0:06:34.560 --> 0:06:35.600
Um, playback.

133
0:06:38.720 --> 0:06:40.320
There's a lot of code for this stuff.

134
0:06:40.960 --> 0:06:41.920
That's totally fine.

135
0:06:41.920 --> 0:06:42.240
Yeah.

136
0:06:42.240 --> 0:06:45.760
Um, we just called into, uh, DLP.

137
0:06:45.760 --> 0:06:46.640
Oh, we've got questions.

138
0:06:46.640 --> 0:06:47.840
So I'll go back to those.

139
0:06:47.840 --> 0:06:50.400
Alex says, what's your favorite part of the source code of Neos?

140
0:06:50.400 --> 0:06:54.800
Uh, I like all the random stuff that's in there that doesn't make sense.

141
0:06:54.800 --> 0:07:01.280
And you have to ask people like, um, I was looking into the, uh, IK code, for example.

142
0:07:01.280 --> 0:07:03.280
Uh, let's go by pedrig.

143
0:07:03.280 --> 0:07:09.040
Um, and I was reading through like the bone, um, the bone matching.

144
0:07:09.040 --> 0:07:11.840
And this is like how we figure out what a bone is.

145
0:07:11.840 --> 0:07:13.760
And I was a little tired.

146
0:07:13.760 --> 0:07:17.600
And so I misread this line several times here is.

147
0:07:17.600 --> 0:07:23.600
So this line basically says that if the lower case, uh, name of your bone contains neck.

148
0:07:24.240 --> 0:07:28.640
And the lower case name of your bone does not contain necklace.

149
0:07:28.640 --> 0:07:29.600
Then it's a neck, right?

150
0:07:29.600 --> 0:07:30.240
That makes sense.

151
0:07:30.240 --> 0:07:30.720
It's a neck.

152
0:07:30.720 --> 0:07:35.600
We found a neck, but I kept reading it as, and the lower name contains necklace.

153
0:07:35.600 --> 0:07:37.360
So I'm like, what is going on here?

154
0:07:37.360 --> 0:07:41.120
Like why do neck bones have to also be necklaces for this to work?

155
0:07:41.120 --> 0:07:44.800
Cause I just missed that, that singular character, but it makes sense.

156
0:07:44.800 --> 0:07:47.280
However, what I like is the story behind that though.

157
0:07:47.280 --> 0:07:51.040
At some point, either naturally thinking about it before it happened,

158
0:07:51.040 --> 0:07:55.440
although most likely when someone brought in a character that had a necklace bone,

159
0:07:55.440 --> 0:08:00.640
uh, Fruits had to make an update to Neos such that it ignored necklace bones.

160
0:08:00.640 --> 0:08:01.920
Which is just, uh, I don't know.

161
0:08:01.920 --> 0:08:04.480
It's, it's, it's interesting, but there's multiple cases of that.

162
0:08:04.480 --> 0:08:07.440
That one's just front of mind because that's what I was doing last.

163
0:08:07.440 --> 0:08:12.400
So moving onwards, um, has asked what exactly is the reason for Neos sessions

164
0:08:12.400 --> 0:08:15.120
starting having starters desync when there's more than 24 players.

165
0:08:15.120 --> 0:08:17.200
There isn't one actual reason.

166
0:08:17.200 --> 0:08:18.640
There are multiple reasons.

167
0:08:18.640 --> 0:08:22.720
Um, the easiest way to answer that though is optimizations that we have not done before.

168
0:08:22.720 --> 0:08:27.040
Um, there are multiple optimizations to Neos that we need to do.

169
0:08:27.600 --> 0:08:32.320
Um, uh, and they all add up in a, uh, a session that's 24 players.

170
0:08:32.320 --> 0:08:36.240
Like one thing being the IK, that's why you'll see in larger sessions,

171
0:08:36.240 --> 0:08:39.360
users are usually being asked by the host, particularly in Creator Gems,

172
0:08:39.360 --> 0:08:43.360
to go into avatars that don't have IK, um, head and hands avatars,

173
0:08:43.360 --> 0:08:46.320
Flatties is what, uh, Mentor sometimes calls them.

174
0:08:46.320 --> 0:08:50.400
Um, and that removes the IK of sort of, you know, the whole body and the legs.

175
0:08:50.400 --> 0:08:52.640
There's just hand positions and head positions.

176
0:08:52.640 --> 0:08:54.080
So that's a lot smoother.

177
0:08:54.080 --> 0:08:58.640
Uh, sometimes it's just sheer load of, of players there at which point

178
0:08:58.640 --> 0:09:00.720
that's sinking the data between all of those players.

179
0:09:00.720 --> 0:09:02.400
Sometimes that's what's causing the lag.

180
0:09:02.400 --> 0:09:07.600
Um, and then sometimes it is, uh, assets or stuff like that.

181
0:09:07.600 --> 0:09:11.440
Bake your blend shapes, that'll help in very busy sessions.

182
0:09:11.440 --> 0:09:13.680
Uh, and various other things along that line.

183
0:09:13.680 --> 0:09:16.880
So there is a bunch of optimizations that we need to do to make that better.

184
0:09:16.880 --> 0:09:22.400
And each one that we do will make it a little bit better, a little bit better.

185
0:09:22.400 --> 0:09:24.160
So, uh, yeah, take a look.

186
0:09:24.160 --> 0:09:27.680
I think we've got an optimization list somewhere on the, on the hub.

187
0:09:27.680 --> 0:09:29.200
So take a look at that one too.

188
0:09:29.200 --> 0:09:33.520
Crusher says, is there anything in particular to look out to help, uh, to, to look out for,

189
0:09:33.520 --> 0:09:38.560
to help prevent worlds from not saving, uh, slash assets not being synced?

190
0:09:38.560 --> 0:09:39.840
Um, yes.

191
0:09:40.480 --> 0:09:46.080
So what I've noticed a lot is that people are overly paranoid about saving

192
0:09:46.080 --> 0:09:47.840
because of that sync issue.

193
0:09:47.840 --> 0:09:51.600
And so they might save an object or a world multiple times a minute.

194
0:09:51.600 --> 0:09:54.480
And that, um, is potentially problematic.

195
0:09:54.480 --> 0:09:58.480
So only save like break up your saves as well.

196
0:09:58.480 --> 0:10:04.000
Um, in particular for worlds, something which I, I don't understand is when people make

197
0:10:04.000 --> 0:10:08.000
a complicated world and then they just save the world over and over again.

198
0:10:08.000 --> 0:10:11.600
What I do is like, I make like a segment of a world and then I save that.

199
0:10:11.600 --> 0:10:14.960
Now, uh, 72 Groove Lake is just fresh in my mind.

200
0:10:14.960 --> 0:10:16.800
So we'll use it as an example here.

201
0:10:16.800 --> 0:10:22.240
Um, 72 Groove Lake is essentially a, um, hillside or mountainside road

202
0:10:22.240 --> 0:10:27.760
that leads into a, um, 1960s, 50s space age, uh, house.

203
0:10:27.760 --> 0:10:30.400
Now inside that house is a bed.

204
0:10:30.400 --> 0:10:34.960
And someone might put that, that bed, you know, import that bed, set up its textures,

205
0:10:34.960 --> 0:10:38.640
position it in the world and then save the entire world because they added a bed.

206
0:10:38.640 --> 0:10:40.320
Instead, I save the bed.

207
0:10:40.320 --> 0:10:41.520
I save the bed, right?

208
0:10:41.520 --> 0:10:44.640
And then it basically means, well, if the world doesn't save, I've saved the bed.

209
0:10:44.640 --> 0:10:46.320
I can just spawn the bed out again.

210
0:10:46.320 --> 0:10:50.240
Um, a more complicated object might be the drinks cabinet that's downstairs in that world.

211
0:10:50.240 --> 0:10:51.680
I save the drinks cabinet.

212
0:10:51.680 --> 0:10:54.240
And then if the world doesn't save, I've got the drinks cabinet saved.

213
0:10:54.240 --> 0:10:56.400
And that will also like reduce down that, right?

214
0:10:56.400 --> 0:10:58.160
I don't need to do that.

215
0:10:58.160 --> 0:11:02.720
Modularity, um, so I rarely save worlds sometimes when I'm working on stuff.

216
0:11:02.720 --> 0:11:04.240
Like I always make sure it's portable.

217
0:11:04.240 --> 0:11:08.400
I'm working on some stuff right now where I basically sort of like open up my tool bag

218
0:11:08.400 --> 0:11:11.120
and I just like throw stuff out of it.

219
0:11:11.120 --> 0:11:11.920
And I'm like, there we go.

220
0:11:11.920 --> 0:11:15.120
The world created, um, that's usually just like scientific tooling and stuff.

221
0:11:15.120 --> 0:11:17.760
And therefore I don't, I don't save the world because I have no need to.

222
0:11:17.760 --> 0:11:19.280
Everything's in my inventory.

223
0:11:19.280 --> 0:11:27.280
Um, on top of that though, it's, uh, figuring out the, um, the best strategy for you to,

224
0:11:27.280 --> 0:11:29.120
to, to get things saving.

225
0:11:29.120 --> 0:11:33.600
Um, as other people are saying, don't delete the local database.

226
0:11:33.600 --> 0:11:40.240
Like I, I am still amazed every time I look at questions and help or Twitter or the steam

227
0:11:40.240 --> 0:11:43.280
or the Reddit and someone has a problem, any problem.

228
0:11:43.280 --> 0:11:45.680
And it could be like completely inane problem.

229
0:11:45.680 --> 0:11:50.080
Help, I stubbed my toe and someone's first response is delete your database.

230
0:11:50.080 --> 0:11:55.200
I'm like, no, no, do not, do not delete your database.

231
0:11:55.200 --> 0:11:59.440
That is the last thing that you should be doing to explain it in a better way.

232
0:11:59.440 --> 0:12:03.440
Your car breaks down and you pop the hood and you don't know engines.

233
0:12:03.440 --> 0:12:06.720
You don't immediately like remove the engine from the car.

234
0:12:06.720 --> 0:12:08.320
You poke around a little bit.

235
0:12:08.320 --> 0:12:10.400
You're like, is something disconnected?

236
0:12:10.400 --> 0:12:12.480
Do I have any idea what I'm doing?

237
0:12:12.480 --> 0:12:17.280
Let me touch the oil cap whilst the car has been running and spray hot oil in my face.

238
0:12:17.280 --> 0:12:18.400
Don't do that either.

239
0:12:18.400 --> 0:12:23.120
But you don't chuck out the entire engine on the side of the road and go, oh, that'll

240
0:12:23.120 --> 0:12:24.000
fix my car.

241
0:12:24.720 --> 0:12:27.200
You just stop deleting the database.

242
0:12:27.760 --> 0:12:30.560
Yeah, I need to, uh, I need to get that updated.

243
0:12:30.560 --> 0:12:34.000
Oh, it is a valid fix for some issues.

244
0:12:34.000 --> 0:12:38.160
Um, but in computing, there are three things you can do for a problem.

245
0:12:38.160 --> 0:12:39.360
You can fix the problem.

246
0:12:39.360 --> 0:12:42.640
You can ignore the problem or you can delete the problem.

247
0:12:42.640 --> 0:12:44.160
Send me that Google result.

248
0:12:44.160 --> 0:12:47.680
And so, you know, when people say restart your computer, if you try to turn it off and

249
0:12:47.680 --> 0:12:49.600
on again, that actually does deleting the problem.

250
0:12:49.600 --> 0:12:54.000
Restarting your computer just flushes out everything, right?

251
0:12:54.000 --> 0:12:55.440
Clears RAM back down to zero.

252
0:12:55.440 --> 0:12:57.280
You completely refresh the computer.

253
0:12:57.280 --> 0:13:03.120
And so everything has to be loaded from disk space again into the CPU, into the memory,

254
0:13:03.120 --> 0:13:04.240
into the RAM.

255
0:13:04.240 --> 0:13:07.280
And therefore, you know, intermittent bugs disappear.

256
0:13:07.280 --> 0:13:09.760
And that's exactly the same for deleting your database.

257
0:13:09.760 --> 0:13:12.400
Everything just gets deleted and it can start afresh.

258
0:13:12.400 --> 0:13:14.320
Now, is that a valid fix for some problems?

259
0:13:14.320 --> 0:13:16.720
Yes, but you don't learn anything in that.

260
0:13:16.720 --> 0:13:18.480
You don't learn anything.

261
0:13:18.480 --> 0:13:24.000
So I've had a problem with my computer for many years, where for a year or two, where

262
0:13:24.000 --> 0:13:27.520
logging in at the lock-in screen, you know, you start your computer, you enter your password.

263
0:13:27.520 --> 0:13:30.400
It would take like 10 minutes to get to the desktop.

264
0:13:30.400 --> 0:13:31.920
And I had no idea what was going on.

265
0:13:31.920 --> 0:13:33.440
And everyone's like, just reinstall windows.

266
0:13:33.440 --> 0:13:35.600
And I'm like, no, no.

267
0:13:35.600 --> 0:13:36.240
What did I do?

268
0:13:36.240 --> 0:13:37.920
I updated windows and it got fixed.

269
0:13:37.920 --> 0:13:39.120
It got back down to two minutes.

270
0:13:39.120 --> 0:13:40.080
It is increasing now, though.

271
0:13:40.080 --> 0:13:41.280
So I probably need to take a look at it again.

272
0:13:41.280 --> 0:13:43.120
But the point is, I will never reinstall windows.

273
0:13:43.120 --> 0:13:44.240
I'll always fix it.

274
0:13:44.240 --> 0:13:48.400
I've had the same issue of windows for longer than I've been in this country.

275
0:13:48.400 --> 0:13:50.080
That's a long question answer, I know.

276
0:13:51.440 --> 0:13:53.120
Or go ahead and move on.

277
0:13:54.320 --> 0:14:00.000
Specs says, pinky works for bone mapping, but the spelling pinky doesn't.

278
0:14:00.000 --> 0:14:03.040
Well, I am actually at that part of the code, so I could take a look.

279
0:14:03.040 --> 0:14:06.400
Uh, yes, confirming pinky doesn't.

280
0:14:06.400 --> 0:14:12.960
However, if your bone name contains P-I, P-I-N, or P-N-K, it should work.

281
0:14:13.680 --> 0:14:18.320
If I check out a different branch, I can actually test it.

282
0:14:18.320 --> 0:14:19.920
Open up again, I'll do it later.

283
0:14:21.280 --> 0:14:22.720
Git changes going.

284
0:14:22.720 --> 0:14:28.000
I don't want to disrupt the Git gods by stashing and changing branches at this time.

285
0:14:28.000 --> 0:14:31.200
Yeah, you get an issue and then we'll take a look at that.

286
0:14:31.200 --> 0:14:37.520
I've got, it's something like 112 tests of our bone naming now, because I was just...

287
0:14:38.240 --> 0:14:41.040
I want to make some changes here, but I don't want to break anything.

288
0:14:42.640 --> 0:14:48.560
So I added just a boatload of tests.

289
0:14:50.080 --> 0:14:51.760
I also did it in a really good way.

290
0:14:52.880 --> 0:14:58.880
I learned some stuff about how you can write data-driven tests using a annotation.

291
0:14:58.880 --> 0:15:04.560
I will paste these into the text chat so you can see them.

292
0:15:04.560 --> 0:15:06.240
Oh yeah, the hip and hip one.

293
0:15:06.240 --> 0:15:07.840
I figured out why that is.

294
0:15:07.840 --> 0:15:09.280
I figured out why that is.

295
0:15:09.280 --> 0:15:11.520
Oh, your message is 6,000 characters long.

296
0:15:11.520 --> 0:15:12.560
We don't support it.

297
0:15:12.560 --> 0:15:14.240
Okay, I'll just delete a few.

298
0:15:14.240 --> 0:15:17.680
Um, I'm just sharing this because I'm kind of like happy about it.

299
0:15:18.240 --> 0:15:24.080
So this is how those tests work.

300
0:15:24.080 --> 0:15:29.840
So I can basically say like, hey, hips, why does hips, left thigh is tagged as left thigh.

301
0:15:31.200 --> 0:15:35.600
Those attributes are just beautiful for testing large bits of programming.

302
0:15:35.600 --> 0:15:38.320
So the reason why hips doesn't work, I know we're jumping around a lot,

303
0:15:38.320 --> 0:15:39.840
and I will get back to questions in a bit.

304
0:15:39.840 --> 0:15:40.960
I know some people get annoyed with that.

305
0:15:40.960 --> 0:15:42.400
I'll get back to questions in just a bit.

306
0:15:43.360 --> 0:15:47.840
Is that we support right hip and left hip.

307
0:15:47.840 --> 0:15:49.680
You actually see it in the middle of that text I did.

308
0:15:49.680 --> 0:15:54.400
We support right hip as the right upper leg and left hip as the left upper leg.

309
0:15:54.400 --> 0:15:58.720
And so that's why we can't do hip as the hips bone right now.

310
0:15:58.720 --> 0:16:01.040
There is a way for us to do that most certainly,

311
0:16:01.040 --> 0:16:05.440
particularly with what I call the ambiguous matching.

312
0:16:06.320 --> 0:16:09.280
But we needed a test workflow like this in place before we did that.

313
0:16:09.280 --> 0:16:10.880
So I can certainly look at that now.

314
0:16:10.880 --> 0:16:12.880
I do believe there is a GitHub issue for that.

315
0:16:12.880 --> 0:16:14.480
But those attributes let me do that.

316
0:16:14.480 --> 0:16:23.280
They let me make changes and ensure that we aren't breaking anything.

317
0:16:23.280 --> 0:16:25.760
All right, moving forwards to additional questions.

318
0:16:25.760 --> 0:16:27.600
I don't actually see any additional questions.

319
0:16:27.600 --> 0:16:30.400
The last one was about pinky versus pinky.

320
0:16:32.000 --> 0:16:33.040
We got that one.

321
0:16:33.040 --> 0:16:35.120
I talked a long length about that one.

322
0:16:35.120 --> 0:16:36.320
That's a good question, Aaron.

323
0:16:36.320 --> 0:16:37.280
That's a very good question.

324
0:16:37.280 --> 0:16:40.000
So Aaron asks, how do we get more people to stay in public worlds?

325
0:16:40.000 --> 0:16:45.680
There's 30 users out of 200 users in public right now, and it's pretty sad.

326
0:16:45.680 --> 0:16:49.280
I agree, but we need to do that on several levels.

327
0:16:49.280 --> 0:16:51.600
So one of the first things that we need to do

328
0:16:51.600 --> 0:16:54.320
is to stop judging people for being in private worlds.

329
0:16:54.320 --> 0:16:56.000
I know that's like counterintuitive,

330
0:16:56.000 --> 0:17:01.680
but just imagine that you are shy or use private worlds a lot.

331
0:17:01.680 --> 0:17:05.520
And your first experience with coming out of your private world bubble

332
0:17:05.520 --> 0:17:08.960
is a lot of people nagging at you for being in private worlds.

333
0:17:08.960 --> 0:17:10.800
Aaron, you've been in private worlds all day.

334
0:17:10.800 --> 0:17:12.000
What the fuck's wrong with you?

335
0:17:12.880 --> 0:17:13.840
That's rude.

336
0:17:13.840 --> 0:17:15.920
It's not going to do a productive conversation.

337
0:17:15.920 --> 0:17:18.880
Instead, you need to make it, oh, hi, it's great to see you.

338
0:17:18.880 --> 0:17:19.760
I'm happy to see you.

339
0:17:19.760 --> 0:17:21.520
Let's make this a good experience for you.

340
0:17:21.520 --> 0:17:23.920
Let's show you that you can be in public worlds a lot.

341
0:17:23.920 --> 0:17:25.440
Let's give you a good experience.

342
0:17:25.440 --> 0:17:30.240
Let's wine and dine you so that you understand that this is a good experience.

343
0:17:30.240 --> 0:17:33.360
That's like a cultural thing that doesn't require any code updates.

344
0:17:33.360 --> 0:17:35.440
That just requires people to sort of change their behavior

345
0:17:35.440 --> 0:17:37.440
about how they react to private worlds.

346
0:17:37.440 --> 0:17:40.080
That's why I don't usually use the hermit meter in my world,

347
0:17:40.080 --> 0:17:42.640
because again, the hermit meter is like a big, giant finger.

348
0:17:42.640 --> 0:17:47.360
It's like you guys in private worlds are wrong, is wrong.

349
0:17:48.720 --> 0:17:52.640
Actuarinus puts it greatly, which is, oh, look who came out of their cave,

350
0:17:53.520 --> 0:17:54.960
which is the introvert way.

351
0:17:54.960 --> 0:17:59.440
I mean, I'm an introvert, so I spent a lot of my teenage years in my bedroom

352
0:17:59.440 --> 0:18:02.720
and my mother was always like, why are you in your bedroom so much?

353
0:18:02.720 --> 0:18:05.840
And I couldn't explain, no matter how many times I tried,

354
0:18:05.840 --> 0:18:08.320
I want to be alone with my thoughts.

355
0:18:10.080 --> 0:18:11.040
Couldn't explain it.

356
0:18:11.600 --> 0:18:15.440
I remember a particular Christmas where she insisted that I come downstairs

357
0:18:15.440 --> 0:18:18.960
to watch the Father Ted Christmas special that I had seen five times in a row.

358
0:18:20.160 --> 0:18:23.360
And I was installing a MySQL database at the time.

359
0:18:23.360 --> 0:18:25.040
And I just tried explaining that instead.

360
0:18:25.040 --> 0:18:27.360
She's like, come downstairs with the family, it's Christmas.

361
0:18:27.360 --> 0:18:30.560
And I'm like, but I'm installing a MySQL database.

362
0:18:30.560 --> 0:18:32.640
And she just didn't understand.

363
0:18:32.640 --> 0:18:34.560
And I'm like, OK, fine, I'll come downstairs

364
0:18:34.560 --> 0:18:36.000
and watch the Father Ted Christmas special.

365
0:18:36.000 --> 0:18:37.600
Anyway, that's the cultural one.

366
0:18:39.120 --> 0:18:40.560
Pretty much that image as well.

367
0:18:40.560 --> 0:18:45.760
But past the cultural one is there are some other cultural issues that you need to do.

368
0:18:45.760 --> 0:18:50.240
So the next ones are reading the room, being considerate,

369
0:18:52.160 --> 0:18:56.320
asking for consent, fixing how you help people,

370
0:18:56.320 --> 0:18:59.680
fixing how you interact with people, and stuff like that.

371
0:18:59.680 --> 0:19:01.440
Just trying to be a better person in that way.

372
0:19:01.440 --> 0:19:06.160
There is that guide being considerate on my user page of my wiki.

373
0:19:06.160 --> 0:19:08.880
The reason it's there is because it's very ranty and slightly rude.

374
0:19:08.880 --> 0:19:10.880
But that's got a lot of stuff that can happen.

375
0:19:11.840 --> 0:19:12.960
Next is safety.

376
0:19:12.960 --> 0:19:20.400
So things like knockback guns, crashing, funky stuff.

377
0:19:21.520 --> 0:19:22.480
They're scared of that.

378
0:19:23.120 --> 0:19:24.560
And then sometimes it's focus.

379
0:19:24.560 --> 0:19:27.200
So if they're building stuff, which is great,

380
0:19:27.200 --> 0:19:29.040
if they're building a really complicated thing,

381
0:19:29.040 --> 0:19:31.600
they usually can't be in a public world.

382
0:19:31.600 --> 0:19:35.760
I'm sure, Mr. Aaron, you will identify with that when we try to build our Jeopardy game.

383
0:19:36.720 --> 0:19:40.080
And I had to draw a red circle around the Jeopardy game

384
0:19:40.080 --> 0:19:42.080
because I just couldn't get anything done.

385
0:19:42.080 --> 0:19:45.920
Just a quick reminder, if you see someone having inspector panels in front of them

386
0:19:45.920 --> 0:19:50.240
or logics in front of them, don't go AFK inside their logics panels

387
0:19:50.240 --> 0:19:54.000
or put a whisper bubble on or in their logics panels.

388
0:19:54.000 --> 0:19:56.880
It's like, just don't do that.

389
0:19:56.880 --> 0:19:59.200
So and then above that are actual features.

390
0:19:59.200 --> 0:20:04.000
So hard permissions, the license system, the license system will help.

391
0:20:04.000 --> 0:20:05.920
But honestly, I think a lot of it is cultural.

392
0:20:05.920 --> 0:20:08.560
There is a side of it, which I can't talk too much about.

393
0:20:08.560 --> 0:20:12.960
There is a side of it, which is to do with adult content.

394
0:20:12.960 --> 0:20:16.480
But, you know, nothing really can really do about that one.

395
0:20:16.480 --> 0:20:20.640
In summary, though, other than the technical issues, it's really behavioral.

396
0:20:20.640 --> 0:20:22.800
It's like, give people a reason to come out.

397
0:20:22.800 --> 0:20:25.360
Did they have a good time in your public world?

398
0:20:25.360 --> 0:20:29.440
In your public world, I'll catch up with all the conversation here.

399
0:20:29.440 --> 0:20:34.720
Zach talks about freezing and public worlds.

400
0:20:34.720 --> 0:20:37.440
Yeah, that's optimization, which is another technical issue.

401
0:20:37.440 --> 0:20:40.800
When we scroll through all the memes, Specket says it's decent.

402
0:20:40.800 --> 0:20:44.320
Yep, the Australians need to host more Australian content

403
0:20:44.320 --> 0:20:46.000
and more Australian public worlds.

404
0:20:46.000 --> 0:20:49.120
And if I start speaking Australian accent, it's entirely accidental.

405
0:20:49.120 --> 0:20:50.160
I have no control over it.

406
0:20:51.600 --> 0:20:54.000
Zinka talks about unwinding and being in private.

407
0:20:54.000 --> 0:20:58.400
I get that. So there are, I guess, the sort of colloquial term over in VRChat.

408
0:20:58.400 --> 0:21:00.800
It's friend groups. People just want to hang out with their friends.

409
0:21:00.800 --> 0:21:01.840
I get that.

410
0:21:01.840 --> 0:21:07.040
You know, in history, there are some of you that won't have ever actually done this

411
0:21:07.040 --> 0:21:09.360
because you've just grown up doing it on the Internet.

412
0:21:09.360 --> 0:21:13.600
But historically, it would be like people physically come to your house

413
0:21:13.600 --> 0:21:16.400
and then they sit on your physical couch and watch films of you.

414
0:21:16.400 --> 0:21:19.040
And maybe there's a bucket of popcorn somewhere.

415
0:21:19.040 --> 0:21:19.760
That happened.

416
0:21:19.760 --> 0:21:24.160
And of course, you know, the Internet, COVID, VR.

417
0:21:24.160 --> 0:21:26.240
No one needs to do that in the real world these days.

418
0:21:27.040 --> 0:21:30.560
But that's the replacement of that is hanging out with smaller groups of people.

419
0:21:30.560 --> 0:21:31.680
I understand that.

420
0:21:31.680 --> 0:21:33.360
Films being another one, I've seen that as well.

421
0:21:33.360 --> 0:21:36.960
People are watching films and they're like halfway through a really complicated film.

422
0:21:38.240 --> 0:21:39.520
Let's say like The Matrix, right?

423
0:21:39.520 --> 0:21:42.160
So imagine you haven't seen The Matrix before

424
0:21:42.160 --> 0:21:44.720
and you have a public world open and someone comes in halfway through.

425
0:21:44.720 --> 0:21:46.000
They'll just be like, who's he?

426
0:21:46.640 --> 0:21:47.760
What's he doing?

427
0:21:47.760 --> 0:21:49.120
Why is he flying?

428
0:21:49.120 --> 0:21:50.560
It's not a good look.

429
0:21:50.560 --> 0:21:53.520
Specs says just hosting more public worlds is a good way to get that going.

430
0:21:53.520 --> 0:21:54.240
Yes.

431
0:21:54.240 --> 0:21:59.440
Now, the hermit meter is a percentage value of private to public users

432
0:21:59.440 --> 0:22:02.080
and it's usually around 70 to 80 percent.

433
0:22:02.640 --> 0:22:07.360
When the VR chat issues happened, I mean, a lot of players that went all the way down to 40 percent,

434
0:22:07.360 --> 0:22:09.760
mostly because it was new players who didn't know what private worlds were.

435
0:22:09.760 --> 0:22:11.200
So they weren't in private worlds.

436
0:22:11.200 --> 0:22:11.760
It was great.

437
0:22:12.320 --> 0:22:15.440
We will steamroll onto questions as we've got more questions coming on.

438
0:22:15.440 --> 0:22:16.880
And I'm just wittering on now.

439
0:22:16.880 --> 0:22:18.480
What is my phone is doing something?

440
0:22:18.480 --> 0:22:22.320
Oh, I've got two packages have arrived downstairs.

441
0:22:22.320 --> 0:22:23.280
I'll have to go get this.

442
0:22:23.280 --> 0:22:23.840
I know what one is.

443
0:22:23.840 --> 0:22:24.880
I don't know what the other one is.

444
0:22:24.880 --> 0:22:25.380
Cool.

445
0:22:26.560 --> 0:22:30.640
Getting trans, is there a way to toggle my torso back and forth to ragdoll as a dynamic bone?

446
0:22:30.640 --> 0:22:35.120
I know torsos are driven by the IK.

447
0:22:35.120 --> 0:22:39.840
The nearest thing I can think of there is to temporarily swap to a duplicate copy of your

448
0:22:39.840 --> 0:22:44.000
avatar that has dynamic bones on but has the head driven.

449
0:22:44.000 --> 0:22:44.880
That might work.

450
0:22:44.880 --> 0:22:46.240
Tony says frame rates are a big deal.

451
0:22:46.240 --> 0:22:47.120
Yep, that's optimization.

452
0:22:47.120 --> 0:22:48.320
That is a technical one.

453
0:22:48.320 --> 0:22:51.040
As Lincoln says, mostly for me, it was bring your Xbox 360 over.

454
0:22:51.040 --> 0:22:52.160
Let's have some Halo.

455
0:22:52.160 --> 0:22:52.660
Yep.

456
0:22:52.960 --> 0:22:58.320
I once took my Xbox and my TV to someone else's university dorm room.

457
0:22:58.320 --> 0:23:02.720
And we had four Xboxes set up next to each other.

458
0:23:02.720 --> 0:23:04.080
And we played through the campaign like that.

459
0:23:04.080 --> 0:23:04.640
That was cool.

460
0:23:06.080 --> 0:23:08.800
Ozzy says here's a random question I've been curious about.

461
0:23:08.800 --> 0:23:10.240
I noticed the IK component.

462
0:23:10.240 --> 0:23:11.120
We're messing with it.

463
0:23:12.400 --> 0:23:13.280
Terrifying start.

464
0:23:13.280 --> 0:23:15.040
Yep, messing with it is always terrifying.

465
0:23:15.040 --> 0:23:18.400
When I'm driving its references, it still controls the undriven slots.

466
0:23:18.400 --> 0:23:22.560
The bones as in the position and rotations are still being changed, but actually pink

467
0:23:22.560 --> 0:23:23.440
indicate it's driven.

468
0:23:24.000 --> 0:23:27.920
Yeah, some components just need to do that and aren't meant to be messed with in that

469
0:23:27.920 --> 0:23:28.420
way.

470
0:23:29.200 --> 0:23:33.200
DNS cannot cause connection issues or problems like that.

471
0:23:33.200 --> 0:23:35.440
DNS is literally just a path to go.

472
0:23:36.800 --> 0:23:43.280
DNS issues can cause latency when attempting to look up a new domain record.

473
0:23:43.280 --> 0:23:48.000
But once a DNS system has given you an IP address, you don't need DNS anymore.

474
0:23:48.000 --> 0:23:49.760
You just find your own route there.

475
0:23:49.760 --> 0:23:53.600
Sometimes DNS can help with that route, but DNS cannot cause as many things as people

476
0:23:53.600 --> 0:23:54.560
say it can.

477
0:23:54.560 --> 0:23:56.720
They're like, I'm de-synced in this world.

478
0:23:56.720 --> 0:23:57.840
It must be my DNS.

479
0:23:57.840 --> 0:23:59.280
I'm like, no?

480
0:24:00.720 --> 0:24:02.560
Especially once the connection's established.

481
0:24:02.560 --> 0:24:03.680
It doesn't touch DNS.

482
0:24:03.680 --> 0:24:04.640
It's just a connection.

483
0:24:05.280 --> 0:24:10.320
Anyway, moving onwards to Kazu who says,

484
0:24:10.320 --> 0:24:13.520
regarding the description of Neosyn, the current situation has not changed for more than half

485
0:24:13.520 --> 0:24:17.360
a year since it was described, so I'm thinking of removing it from the wiki to avoid confusion

486
0:24:17.360 --> 0:24:18.400
until it's actually implemented.

487
0:24:18.400 --> 0:24:19.120
Is that okay?

488
0:24:19.120 --> 0:24:20.960
No, no, just leave things as they are.

489
0:24:21.760 --> 0:24:25.840
I'm not quite sure what you're referring to, but please just leave things as they are in

490
0:24:25.840 --> 0:24:27.600
terms of Neosyn and the vulture, et cetera.

491
0:24:28.240 --> 0:24:32.640
Lord Tremor says, is there a way to fix dissident and broken IK?

492
0:24:32.640 --> 0:24:35.520
That's not a word I expected in this office hours, but thank you for using it.

493
0:24:35.520 --> 0:24:36.400
It's a good word.

494
0:24:36.400 --> 0:24:40.880
Dissident and broken IK, specifically hips about re-uploading it, throwing it to the

495
0:24:40.880 --> 0:24:46.720
editor, that is situational and depends on what the problem is.

496
0:24:47.360 --> 0:24:51.280
You describe the problem sort of, but I don't know what the problem is until I have some

497
0:24:51.280 --> 0:24:52.000
more details.

498
0:24:53.120 --> 0:24:55.440
For example, there is a bunch of problems I've seen.

499
0:24:56.160 --> 0:25:01.040
Just going through a random list of ones that appear in my head is sometimes the hip bone

500
0:25:01.040 --> 0:25:05.680
is disconnected from the spine bone, and so people have like a long snake body because

501
0:25:05.680 --> 0:25:09.040
when they move up, like the hips lag behind, that's funny.

502
0:25:09.040 --> 0:25:10.720
Sometimes the hip is flipped upside down.

503
0:25:10.720 --> 0:25:16.960
If your model has a flipped hip, the creator of that model needs to get with 2022.

504
0:25:16.960 --> 0:25:19.280
Flipped hips is such like a 2018 thing.

505
0:25:20.160 --> 0:25:21.360
No more flipped hips, please.

506
0:25:21.360 --> 0:25:22.640
That would also cause problems.

507
0:25:22.640 --> 0:25:24.800
If it's a naming issue, that will need to be Blender.

508
0:25:24.800 --> 0:25:27.280
It really does depend on the specifics of the issue.

509
0:25:27.280 --> 0:25:31.520
Feel free to ask them questions and help whenever you have an actual, you know, a worked example

510
0:25:31.520 --> 0:25:32.080
or get it done.

511
0:25:32.080 --> 0:25:33.600
I just need more information.

512
0:25:33.600 --> 0:25:37.760
No user found says, will the Steam Deck eventually get full support for the non VR mode like VR

513
0:25:37.760 --> 0:25:37.920
chat?

514
0:25:37.920 --> 0:25:41.680
Because today I tried it on the SVR on the Steam Deck and it didn't run great experience

515
0:25:41.680 --> 0:25:42.080
glitches.

516
0:25:43.520 --> 0:25:45.040
Hardware is a really tricky one.

517
0:25:45.040 --> 0:25:49.760
It's basically we need to make sure that the engineering team has that hardware and that

518
0:25:49.760 --> 0:25:50.960
they have time to look at it.

519
0:25:50.960 --> 0:25:53.360
So right now we don't, but we might in the future.

520
0:25:53.360 --> 0:25:56.560
Same thing goes with the all the VR headsets that are meant to be announced at the end

521
0:25:56.560 --> 0:25:57.120
of this year.

522
0:25:57.120 --> 0:26:00.400
If we don't have them, we can't really integrate them.

523
0:26:00.400 --> 0:26:03.680
And if they haven't been officially released, we can't integrate them.

524
0:26:03.680 --> 0:26:06.800
I know some people are like, can you support the quest that's been leaked?

525
0:26:06.800 --> 0:26:08.320
I'm like, no, I don't know what it is.

526
0:26:08.320 --> 0:26:12.000
It's like, yeah, I've seen the leak, but as a company, we need to wait for it actually

527
0:26:12.000 --> 0:26:16.320
be to be released because that's when the, you know, the SDKs, the technical manuals,

528
0:26:16.320 --> 0:26:19.120
the integration guides get released.

529
0:26:19.120 --> 0:26:21.920
So we are at 33.

530
0:26:21.920 --> 0:26:25.760
So the people that are typing right now, if you have questions, please get them in and

531
0:26:25.760 --> 0:26:27.360
we'll close questions very shortly.

532
0:26:27.360 --> 0:26:31.280
Lex says, would you be able to try out the transcription API for this office hours?

533
0:26:31.280 --> 0:26:32.000
Yeah, sure.

534
0:26:32.000 --> 0:26:33.760
I mean, the recording's downloadable.

535
0:26:33.760 --> 0:26:34.320
Just go for it.

536
0:26:35.920 --> 0:26:41.760
Well, Tremor says, basically I have no spines, it registers my chest bone as my spine sending

537
0:26:41.760 --> 0:26:42.800
my pelvis thrusting.

538
0:26:43.360 --> 0:26:43.600
Yeah.

539
0:26:45.920 --> 0:26:50.960
You're going to have to look at the humanoid rig requirements Wiki page and maybe adjust

540
0:26:50.960 --> 0:26:54.800
the bone naming of your model before you get going.

541
0:26:54.800 --> 0:26:56.640
Specs ask, what's the current version number?

542
0:26:56.640 --> 0:26:59.920
For bug reports right now, I just put in latest because of the situation.

543
0:26:59.920 --> 0:27:01.920
I shouldn't do that, but I do.

544
0:27:03.680 --> 0:27:06.960
But if you just do 1.28, that'll be fine.

545
0:27:06.960 --> 0:27:08.640
2022, 1.28.

546
0:27:08.640 --> 0:27:12.400
I know that will bite me, but whenever I log a bug and it's logged by me, I know what I

547
0:27:12.400 --> 0:27:12.720
mean.

548
0:27:12.720 --> 0:27:13.200
I can do it.

549
0:27:13.200 --> 0:27:16.000
It's terrible behavior, but yeah.

550
0:27:16.720 --> 0:27:17.920
Okay, good, good.

551
0:27:17.920 --> 0:27:21.120
Yeah, 128 or 2022, 128 will be good.

552
0:27:21.120 --> 0:27:23.920
I know we've got 1310 and 1335.

553
0:27:23.920 --> 0:27:27.280
That's just how our processing worked.

554
0:27:27.280 --> 0:27:28.880
That is all the questions I see.

555
0:27:28.880 --> 0:27:29.680
No user found.

556
0:27:29.680 --> 0:27:32.240
Kazu and Zlinka, you are the last questions.

557
0:27:32.240 --> 0:27:34.000
Please type them or stop.

558
0:27:34.000 --> 0:27:36.320
And we'll get on with those questions and then stop.

559
0:27:36.320 --> 0:27:39.440
And then I'll upload the recording and then we'll make noises.

560
0:27:39.440 --> 0:27:41.200
No user found says, how's my holiday?

561
0:27:41.200 --> 0:27:41.700
Good.

562
0:27:42.720 --> 0:27:44.240
Yeah, tabbing back.

563
0:27:45.120 --> 0:27:46.800
Yeah, go the OZ stuff.

564
0:27:46.800 --> 0:27:49.120
I was tabbed out to another location for a second.

565
0:27:49.120 --> 0:27:50.160
I believe we are done.

566
0:27:50.160 --> 0:27:54.800
Although I do see Tiki, please feel free to type a question if you have it.

567
0:27:54.800 --> 0:27:56.640
Otherwise, that will be the last.

568
0:27:56.640 --> 0:27:56.880
Good.

569
0:27:56.880 --> 0:27:57.760
We have a question.

570
0:27:57.760 --> 0:27:58.800
Just in time, Tiki.

571
0:27:58.800 --> 0:27:59.840
Just in time.

572
0:27:59.840 --> 0:28:03.760
Inlogics, is there a way to operate on the X of a rotation without going through XYZ

573
0:28:03.760 --> 0:28:04.400
data types?

574
0:28:05.440 --> 0:28:07.120
Yes and no.

575
0:28:07.120 --> 0:28:08.240
Depends on the situation.

576
0:28:08.240 --> 0:28:11.840
So you shouldn't be unpacking a quaternion.

577
0:28:11.840 --> 0:28:13.680
Unpacking those is weird.

578
0:28:13.680 --> 0:28:18.720
Basically, the XYZW components of a quaternion interrelate because they all need to add up

579
0:28:18.720 --> 0:28:19.280
to a number.

580
0:28:19.280 --> 0:28:20.560
I think it's one.

581
0:28:20.560 --> 0:28:24.960
And so operating on them directly via the data type isn't advisable.

582
0:28:25.600 --> 0:28:29.680
You can drop it into Euler angles using the Euler angle node.

583
0:28:29.680 --> 0:28:32.720
Then I'll change a cot back into a float 3.

584
0:28:32.720 --> 0:28:34.160
And then you can operate on just the X.

585
0:28:34.960 --> 0:28:40.960
However, what I would like to suggest that you do is start learning quaternion mathematics.

586
0:28:40.960 --> 0:28:45.600
So if you want to operate on just the X component, then what you can do is let's say you have

587
0:28:45.600 --> 0:28:53.280
an existing quaternion, you can if you want to add an X component, you can multiply it

588
0:28:53.280 --> 0:29:00.240
by a float 3 that has a value in the X and then 0 in the rest of them using the multiply

589
0:29:00.240 --> 0:29:00.880
operator.

590
0:29:00.880 --> 0:29:04.560
Now, I know that's confusing that when you want to add two quaternions together, you

591
0:29:04.560 --> 0:29:05.440
need to multiply them.

592
0:29:05.440 --> 0:29:07.040
But that's just the way it works.

593
0:29:08.000 --> 0:29:12.480
You can also use the wonderful node axis angle, which should be used literally most of the

594
0:29:12.480 --> 0:29:15.840
time when composing quaternions, because it's beautiful.

595
0:29:15.840 --> 0:29:21.360
Axis angle will let you create a quaternion in a particular axis.

596
0:29:21.360 --> 0:29:26.720
Otherwise, you have to bump it out to Euler space, make your adjustments, and then convert

597
0:29:26.720 --> 0:29:27.840
it back to a quaternion.

598
0:29:27.840 --> 0:29:29.280
And with that, that'll be the last question.

599
0:29:29.280 --> 0:29:33.920
To give you any more updates on that one or questions on that one, do let me know.

600
0:29:33.920 --> 0:29:36.000
I'm happy to do stuff.

601
0:29:36.000 --> 0:29:37.520
Quaternions aren't complicated.

602
0:29:37.520 --> 0:29:39.760
You just need to spend some time to learn them.

603
0:29:39.760 --> 0:29:40.880
I know that's difficult.

604
0:29:40.880 --> 0:29:42.720
So I'm trying to do that, though.

605
0:29:42.720 --> 0:29:48.160
Whenever I feel myself going for the Euler nodes, I'm just like, nope, I will learn the

606
0:29:48.160 --> 0:29:49.600
quaternion way of doing this.

607
0:29:50.160 --> 0:29:52.400
And it's working quite well.

608
0:29:53.200 --> 0:29:54.800
I will see you guys next week.

609
0:29:54.800 --> 0:29:58.560
If you have any questions, please ping me, DM me questions and help.

610
0:29:58.560 --> 0:29:59.840
And I will see you next time.

611
0:29:59.840 --> 0:30:00.480
Bye bye.

612
0:30:00.480 --> 0:30:11.520
I need to push the special buttons to end the stage because I changed it recently.
