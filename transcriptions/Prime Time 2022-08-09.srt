0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.000
Hello, okay, we're gonna get started welcome to office hours with prime. That's me. Hello

2
0:00:05.080 --> 0:00:08.580
If you have any questions about Neos, please drop them into the office hours text chat

3
0:00:08.580 --> 0:00:11.520
There is a few above the one that you're currently in. That's the community meetings channel

4
0:00:11.520 --> 0:00:14.100
I will answer them in the order that they appear if you have any questions

5
0:00:14.100 --> 0:00:19.880
Please drop them in if you think of any questions any point that is not during the office hours free filtered

6
0:00:19.880 --> 0:00:24.040
Fit there. Yeah, feel free to DM me or asking questions and help. Thank you

7
0:00:24.240 --> 0:00:29.760
Alright, so we're gonna start with some questions that were pre-loaded in from specs at like half an hour before

8
0:00:29.760 --> 0:00:33.200
So I appreciate that. Thank you queuing those in so specs asks

9
0:00:33.200 --> 0:00:37.080
Would you consider the performance cost of a no collision mesh collider to be significant?

10
0:00:37.080 --> 0:00:41.800
I was taking steps to optimize collisions for a world and I wasn't sure it was worth removing some mesh colliders

11
0:00:41.800 --> 0:00:46.000
Even if they weren't were in effect only colliding the lasers. Ah, yeah, don't worry about that

12
0:00:46.660 --> 0:00:51.080
No collision doesn't mean like no collision no collision. It is you this means no collision

13
0:00:51.680 --> 0:00:52.800
events

14
0:00:52.800 --> 0:00:58.920
This particular filters that occur with the physics events when it comes to colliders and saying it to no collision will avoid as many

15
0:00:58.920 --> 0:01:03.800
Collision events as possible. But of course, we'll still have some because it exists. So

16
0:01:04.760 --> 0:01:11.120
Yeah, moving onwards to storms question storm asked. How is the voice mode sync component used and see any documentation on it?

17
0:01:11.120 --> 0:01:15.080
So voice mode sync, I just looked it up because hey, I don't know so I looked up the code for it

18
0:01:15.080 --> 0:01:17.680
First of all, it will only work in user space. That's cool

19
0:01:18.480 --> 0:01:25.320
And then in user space is basically an indicator for which voice mode you're on. So there is an output which is a

20
0:01:25.320 --> 0:01:28.760
enum, which will list your voice mode and

21
0:01:29.480 --> 0:01:34.660
Then there's a couple of booleans that will list like hey, this is the voice modes that you're allowed to use

22
0:01:34.920 --> 0:01:39.840
So I think it's used in part of the construction of the voice mode indicator in the top left of your dash

23
0:01:39.840 --> 0:01:43.720
But I have seen some other uses for it in particular. I used it

24
0:01:44.520 --> 0:01:52.040
Recently like a few months ago etc to make a custom voice mode facet, which was very very particular about how mute was undone

25
0:01:52.040 --> 0:01:57.640
I think it was like you had to hold or double click or do some like really more intentional

26
0:01:58.040 --> 0:02:04.360
Matter to try and unmute things because they were worried about being accidentally unmuted as their unmute user. So that's cool

27
0:02:04.800 --> 0:02:08.480
Alex is building the thing interesting recently. Let me see what's in my screenshots

28
0:02:09.720 --> 0:02:11.720
Yes, I'm working on

29
0:02:12.280 --> 0:02:16.680
anxiety exposure experiments with Hamish SHFR and

30
0:02:16.680 --> 0:02:23.560
We have like anxiety exposures and one of them is this thing which Hamish keeps doing and I always find amazing

31
0:02:23.560 --> 0:02:29.300
Which is if you like play with the IK of a non avatar model like a skin mesh model

32
0:02:29.300 --> 0:02:35.360
You can actually put like a look at user component on their head and it will swivel and look at you

33
0:02:35.400 --> 0:02:40.080
it's the idea here being hey give a presentation in laboratory to a bunch of scientists and

34
0:02:40.760 --> 0:02:42.300
It gets kind of freaky

35
0:02:42.300 --> 0:02:48.440
Let me get the screenshots of that because if you don't limit it, you can basically just snap the heads off

36
0:02:53.000 --> 0:02:56.040
And it looks it just it looks really creepy

37
0:02:58.800 --> 0:03:02.120
Lego creator says why does the logics node browser and

38
0:03:02.560 --> 0:03:09.600
Create menu ATC have sliding animations, but attached component menu does not the attached component menu was really made just quickly, right?

39
0:03:09.600 --> 0:03:15.160
it's a really complicated menu and it was just made quickly to like work and it got more and more complicated as we added to

40
0:03:15.160 --> 0:03:16.520
it and

41
0:03:16.520 --> 0:03:18.880
It's actually quite a good example of that problem

42
0:03:18.880 --> 0:03:21.860
Which you'll hear freaks talk about if you speak to him about like hey

43
0:03:21.860 --> 0:03:24.800
Why don't you do this like one quick fix for this one particular feature?

44
0:03:25.040 --> 0:03:30.080
The attached component menu is one of notable examples about that. There are many other examples, right?

45
0:03:30.080 --> 0:03:33.360
The attached component menu just needed to keep getting more and more complicated

46
0:03:33.400 --> 0:03:39.040
It's like we do this feature this feature that feature this feature this feature and it just kept getting more and more complicated

47
0:03:39.040 --> 0:03:42.600
And so it hasn't grown with time and that's why I want to completely rework it

48
0:03:42.600 --> 0:03:45.880
So it can grow with time and so when you are thinking in your head

49
0:03:45.880 --> 0:03:50.560
Oh take me like five minutes if I had access and I could make a code change to the menu

50
0:03:50.560 --> 0:03:52.720
Yes, it would but then you'd add that to like the pile

51
0:03:53.680 --> 0:04:00.080
Like a house cards, it'll come it'll come toppling down. So the attached component menu is is showing that age and showing that

52
0:04:01.680 --> 0:04:03.680
rigidity

53
0:04:03.680 --> 0:04:11.000
I'm moving downwards past my creepy creepy doctors for you toes

54
0:04:12.560 --> 0:04:14.240
Yeah, they're creepy

55
0:04:14.240 --> 0:04:19.960
We also had what she once we had an auditorium for the people who are experiencing performance issues because of course they had you know

56
0:04:19.960 --> 0:04:24.080
Legs arms etc. And so we just removed everything except their heads

57
0:04:24.600 --> 0:04:31.000
Their heads follow and I do believe it's still in my memes folder is quite intensive to load but in my mean folder

58
0:04:31.000 --> 0:04:33.000
There's a sphere of those heads

59
0:04:33.000 --> 0:04:37.680
That sphere aligned and it will animate to the me channel music

60
0:04:37.680 --> 0:04:40.880
I was I don't remember why I built that but hey

61
0:04:42.120 --> 0:04:44.520
It's in the memes folder. It is terrifying

62
0:04:45.920 --> 0:04:48.960
Okay, moving downwards. Where are we?

63
0:04:49.760 --> 0:04:55.880
Cobalt crusher. Thank you. Oh crusader. I'm so sorry. I've read that as crusher for like three weeks and it's not that

64
0:04:55.880 --> 0:05:03.240
Anyway, is there a way to better layout or organize for logics such as maybe a plain like component tools

65
0:05:03.800 --> 0:05:08.920
That nodes could all make snap to there are a variety ways of doing it and they usually have colors associated with them as you

66
0:05:08.920 --> 0:05:10.920
Can see from the reactions to your message

67
0:05:11.480 --> 0:05:16.360
There are blueprints which is the older version of what people use these days, which is called a red print

68
0:05:17.000 --> 0:05:22.280
Really the the reason for the naming and color change is just to distinguish them. There is also a green print

69
0:05:22.280 --> 0:05:27.400
There is also a green print. There's also a black print, but I haven't released that that's prime's print. I don't use it

70
0:05:27.400 --> 0:05:29.080
That's why it's not released

71
0:05:29.080 --> 0:05:33.080
You know, my avatar is like 90% black. So I tend to use that color as like a

72
0:05:33.600 --> 0:05:34.960
branding thing

73
0:05:34.960 --> 0:05:36.960
It's kind of like a weird brand though

74
0:05:37.080 --> 0:05:40.840
But yeah, I haven't released that one and I won't be it was just experiment

75
0:05:40.840 --> 0:05:44.520
And I got it to work a little bit better than all of the other prints, but it was pretty flaky

76
0:05:44.520 --> 0:05:46.520
So I didn't release it

77
0:05:47.000 --> 0:05:49.760
Those work in aligning the nodes and

78
0:05:49.760 --> 0:05:51.120
And

79
0:05:51.120 --> 0:05:55.840
Various other techniques and tools for them. There is a good tutorial series on the red print from business lawyer

80
0:05:55.840 --> 0:05:58.800
I do want to call out that there are other printer systems out there though

81
0:05:58.800 --> 0:06:02.800
Because I don't want to like, you know do any sort of favoritism like things. So do try them all

82
0:06:04.080 --> 0:06:08.000
additionally for that there are actually ways in which you should be building your

83
0:06:08.560 --> 0:06:13.680
Things in logics to to not require redprints like people always like weirded out when I'm like, yeah

84
0:06:13.680 --> 0:06:16.720
I don't use them ever and there are some for some users like that

85
0:06:16.720 --> 0:06:21.120
um, I understand that like the red print is really good for some people particularly those who

86
0:06:21.520 --> 0:06:26.000
Who need that plane to sort of lay out and focus on the logics is great for that

87
0:06:26.240 --> 0:06:31.040
But I just don't find them necessary. One of the reasons for that is that I don't

88
0:06:32.960 --> 0:06:34.560
I don't make large collections

89
0:06:34.560 --> 0:06:38.080
Like I see pictures in screenshots or in the logics channel all the time of like logics

90
0:06:38.080 --> 0:06:43.120
That's like the size of a building and it's just like pack early often and modular modular

91
0:06:43.120 --> 0:06:44.960
A

92
0:06:44.960 --> 0:06:47.040
Lots of things that are being created. Um

93
0:06:47.600 --> 0:06:53.200
You'll see that in if you poke around in like any of the the jp team's um stuff

94
0:06:53.280 --> 0:06:56.080
You'll see that they do it the sort of modular way that I tend to do it

95
0:06:56.480 --> 0:07:00.080
If you poke around in like really really polished stuff probably even the red print

96
0:07:00.320 --> 0:07:05.520
You'll see a lot of stuff that's sort of like packed early and often and that way you'll see hey

97
0:07:05.920 --> 0:07:09.440
There's like 10 nodes in this pack. Do we really need a red print for that?

98
0:07:09.440 --> 0:07:15.360
Nope, these 10 nodes connect to a another 10 nodes in another pack. Do we need a red print for that?

99
0:07:15.360 --> 0:07:19.840
No, we just unpack and pack different things that you can never get like functions

100
0:07:19.920 --> 0:07:23.600
They don't really like communicate similar to like a function snack would in a game instead

101
0:07:23.680 --> 0:07:31.120
They communicate via dynamic variables dynamic impulses in some cases just like copious uses of fire on true

102
0:07:31.520 --> 0:07:34.320
um, but that is what I recommend and you can

103
0:07:35.040 --> 0:07:38.480
totally use redprints with that system, but like think about

104
0:07:38.480 --> 0:07:44.560
Like both approaches so think about how you can use red print to organize your logics and also

105
0:07:45.040 --> 0:07:48.240
How you can break your logics up such that you can pack it early and often

106
0:07:48.640 --> 0:07:53.920
Um that helps a lot and that way you won't have like a chaotic mess everywhere

107
0:07:54.240 --> 0:07:58.240
Like I am constantly making packs like constantly like it's like oh i've made two nodes

108
0:07:58.240 --> 0:08:00.880
I'll pack it and i'm like another two nodes are here and pick that pack that

109
0:08:01.280 --> 0:08:06.080
Um, just get it out of your screen if you don't need to if you don't need to do that. Um

110
0:08:06.080 --> 0:08:10.880
Um, do take a look at those printy things. So there are multiple ones and multiple colors

111
0:08:10.880 --> 0:08:13.040
Uh moving forwards

112
0:08:13.040 --> 0:08:15.040
Plush

113
0:08:15.040 --> 0:08:20.560
I don't know how to pronounce that. I'm sorry. I'm doing a terrible bad job. I'm also just rereading cobble's name

114
0:08:20.560 --> 0:08:24.080
I'm, so sorry about that one. I'm just I read it incorrectly. Anyway, moving on

115
0:08:24.080 --> 0:08:28.560
Uh, they say how much data does the host process through itself?

116
0:08:28.560 --> 0:08:30.560
Like if someone imported model from his pc

117
0:08:30.560 --> 0:08:35.760
Does it mean that it would have to go through the host first and then everyone will see it since it mentions about the host

118
0:08:35.760 --> 0:08:40.640
About mesh networking plans on github. It's really difficult to explain

119
0:08:41.200 --> 0:08:42.240
um

120
0:08:42.240 --> 0:08:43.120
unless

121
0:08:43.120 --> 0:08:46.800
Um, we talk about the data model for a bit. So we'll talk about the data model for a bit

122
0:08:47.360 --> 0:08:50.720
For that though, we're going to need to talk about sort of data storage and to avoid technicalities

123
0:08:50.720 --> 0:08:55.920
We'll just sort of use an analogy and the analogy is an excel spreadsheet

124
0:08:57.440 --> 0:09:00.400
So this is going to be terrible, I know it's going to be terrible but here we go

125
0:09:00.400 --> 0:09:06.960
If you imagine that there is a google excel spreadsheet whatever like system you use to share spreadsheets with your with your office workers

126
0:09:06.960 --> 0:09:10.960
Whatever you want to use multiple people can view that spreadsheet and make changes to it

127
0:09:11.280 --> 0:09:15.200
Now you can view that spreadsheet just by loading the page and then you'll see you know

128
0:09:15.200 --> 0:09:17.200
The numbers and the rows on the spreadsheet

129
0:09:17.280 --> 0:09:23.440
It's only when you change a number like a change a number in a cell change a cell's value that

130
0:09:23.840 --> 0:09:26.500
A message needs to go from your computer

131
0:09:27.200 --> 0:09:28.080
to

132
0:09:28.080 --> 0:09:34.400
Google docs or office docs whatever you want to call its server and it tells everyone else that is looking at that spreadsheet

133
0:09:34.800 --> 0:09:42.400
This cell a1 on your spreadsheet has changed from three to four and that's sort of highly analogy specific

134
0:09:42.640 --> 0:09:48.400
How uh, Neos works there is a giant spreadsheet in the cloud hosted on the host's computer

135
0:09:48.400 --> 0:09:49.200
So it's not even in the cloud

136
0:09:49.200 --> 0:09:55.040
It's not a host computer and when you join a session you get the most recent copy of that spreadsheet and it's like cool

137
0:09:55.120 --> 0:09:57.120
I've got the most recent copy of that spreadsheet

138
0:09:57.120 --> 0:10:01.840
I know that there is an a1 there's a cell that says three and because that set is three

139
0:10:02.160 --> 0:10:09.120
There is a floating cube in the left here shaped like a cheese piece of cheese when you move that around as a user you are

140
0:10:09.200 --> 0:10:10.960
sending um

141
0:10:10.960 --> 0:10:17.280
Messages to the host and saying I am moving this I am moving this and that is then updating the host and saying hey

142
0:10:17.360 --> 0:10:21.280
This this number that is three is now whatever position you're moving it within the world

143
0:10:21.600 --> 0:10:26.000
And then that message is then relayed out to the other people, uh that are in the session

144
0:10:26.000 --> 0:10:32.960
So when you're desynced, it's actually caused by those updates not going through and then there's some sort of numeric queuing and snacking that happens there

145
0:10:33.200 --> 0:10:38.000
So, you know, I move a cube two minutes to the left and then two minutes to the right cool

146
0:10:38.000 --> 0:10:44.560
You missed that two minute units to the right message because you're desynced the cube will still be in its original location

147
0:10:45.360 --> 0:10:50.400
Because you haven't got the message yet that it is moved. So that's basically how Neos works

148
0:10:50.880 --> 0:10:52.080
It's a lot more complicated than that

149
0:10:52.080 --> 0:10:57.440
I was trying to analogy it down to sort of be generic for everyone if that was a terrible analogy. I do apologize

150
0:10:58.720 --> 0:11:04.320
Uh, Jason, if you know the language Jason synced over the internet is basically what it is. But anyway, um

151
0:11:04.880 --> 0:11:09.840
Moving towards the actual question then based on that foundational knowledge when you create a model

152
0:11:10.320 --> 0:11:14.800
Um, you will update you will upload the data from your computer into the session

153
0:11:15.200 --> 0:11:19.520
Once it's uploaded into the session and complete in a way that we can transmit it across

154
0:11:19.520 --> 0:11:22.560
It will then be transmitted the host and then load it to everyone else

155
0:11:22.960 --> 0:11:26.960
So a good example here being I don't know a picture like people spawn pictures in Neos all the time

156
0:11:27.360 --> 0:11:31.760
You take the picture find it. It's a meme a picture of the hat or whatever you put it in the world

157
0:11:31.760 --> 0:11:36.960
You'll see it first and Neos will do some processing to make it a little bit faster for other people to see it

158
0:11:37.360 --> 0:11:43.040
Um, but sometimes other people won't see it and that's because it has to go for like via the host to you guys backwards and forwards

159
0:11:43.040 --> 0:11:46.400
Etc. And again that does depend on the URL of the image if it's like a

160
0:11:46.400 --> 0:11:49.680
Web address, then it will be faster if it's in the nearest db link

161
0:11:49.680 --> 0:11:53.040
It'll be faster because everyone else can fetch that like in an isolated way

162
0:11:53.120 --> 0:11:59.440
But the actual like there is a picture here and the URL of the picture is this has to go through the host

163
0:12:00.000 --> 0:12:04.640
As for the mesh networking plans that you mentioned at the end there, um mesh networking would be basically

164
0:12:05.520 --> 0:12:07.840
A host user is also known as the authority user

165
0:12:07.840 --> 0:12:11.680
In fact, the host user is often not referred to in code as host user

166
0:12:11.680 --> 0:12:14.800
Like if you looked at the source code of Neos a lot of times it's just like world authority

167
0:12:14.800 --> 0:12:20.640
And that means host user so the world authority is like who has authority over the session like if something's happening

168
0:12:20.640 --> 0:12:22.560
Who is the authority to say? Hey, that's not happening

169
0:12:22.560 --> 0:12:29.280
Um, and that's usually the host right now mesh networking that would more be a sort of consensus based algorithm

170
0:12:29.280 --> 0:12:33.600
Or maybe some sort of like brown robin or something like that and it would basically be hey

171
0:12:33.600 --> 0:12:39.120
There is a collection of authorities and they are syncing the information around them in a sort of ring or chain

172
0:12:39.120 --> 0:12:44.560
Whatever sort of structure fits your sort of visualization there and trying to make it a little bit faster

173
0:12:44.560 --> 0:12:49.200
Trying to figure out sort of how to synchronize all that data across that would also allow things

174
0:12:49.360 --> 0:12:52.080
Uh, like larger worlds as well because like hey, you know

175
0:12:52.080 --> 0:12:56.240
This part of the mesh could do this part of the world this part of the mesh could do that part of the world

176
0:12:56.320 --> 0:12:58.320
It would be cool. Uh

177
0:12:58.400 --> 0:13:05.600
Not specifically related to like it's like only like partially related to your like question though mesh networking. That's more sort of different

178
0:13:06.080 --> 0:13:09.520
Uh moving forwards yellow asks. I saw people put materials as components

179
0:13:09.520 --> 0:13:13.520
What are some reasons to do that over not having it the default way? Um materials are components

180
0:13:13.520 --> 0:13:15.680
Uh, everything is components even logics is components

181
0:13:15.760 --> 0:13:19.600
Um, hence why when people like i'm avoiding logics because I heard logics is slow

182
0:13:19.920 --> 0:13:26.400
I want you to like quote this everywhere on the internet logics is just components use it. It's not slow

183
0:13:26.560 --> 0:13:31.380
It's not bad. Don't avoid it. Just use it dash prime 2022

184
0:13:32.240 --> 0:13:33.120
um

185
0:13:33.120 --> 0:13:34.480
so materials as components

186
0:13:34.480 --> 0:13:34.720
Yeah

187
0:13:34.720 --> 0:13:40.320
So, um, I tend to do this now as well and the reason behind that is because uh a lot of times when i'm using materials

188
0:13:40.400 --> 0:13:42.160
I know exactly what I want to do with it

189
0:13:42.160 --> 0:13:46.800
I know where I need it and therefore I don't want the ball floating around like when you use the material tool tip to create

190
0:13:46.800 --> 0:13:52.720
A material it'll create a ball as well. And sometimes I just don't want balls hanging around and you can quote that as well. Um

191
0:13:53.440 --> 0:13:58.320
When you create a material the material will be created on that sphere and that sphere will have a component on it

192
0:13:58.320 --> 0:13:59.920
Which is that material?

193
0:13:59.920 --> 0:14:05.200
Uh, and sometimes you'll lose a reference to that material because if you delete it it'll end up into the asset system

194
0:14:05.520 --> 0:14:10.160
Where it's sort of kept as a sort of like table key value storage up there in the asset system

195
0:14:10.160 --> 0:14:13.040
Uh, but if you want to be sure exactly where that material is

196
0:14:13.360 --> 0:14:16.180
You can put it directly onto a slot using the components

197
0:14:16.480 --> 0:14:22.320
either way works and doesn't really have any like benefits or downsides but doing it the second way as a component definitely allows you to

198
0:14:22.320 --> 0:14:26.400
Control it a lot more having said that you should only do what I just said

199
0:14:26.560 --> 0:14:30.800
If you need to change the properties of the component using logics or other components

200
0:14:31.120 --> 0:14:36.260
If you do not need to change the material once it's in stop putting on your avatar

201
0:14:36.260 --> 0:14:40.820
Let the asset system handle it video on that one when I get around to it because I see that all the time

202
0:14:41.140 --> 0:14:46.900
People are like I will put the material on my avatar and all the textures on my avatar and i'm like

203
0:14:46.900 --> 0:14:52.980
Thank you for invalidating the entire asset systems deduplication method. Thank you. Thank you for doing that great

204
0:14:53.520 --> 0:14:59.220
Optimization that you've just ignored and completely disabled. Um more on that one if there are any questions about that one

205
0:14:59.220 --> 0:15:04.740
I guess um dorky says that they're like, uh, ryvi's logic tip that snaps nodes in a flat plane. I like that one, too

206
0:15:04.740 --> 0:15:08.020
Um, that one makes it easier to sort of keep notes together on the same

207
0:15:08.260 --> 0:15:12.580
Um, I guess z level like the same depth level. I don't really mind about that

208
0:15:12.580 --> 0:15:17.780
Sometimes i'll tidy up but like I like using the 3d space if you look at the logic setups

209
0:15:17.780 --> 0:15:23.780
I do you'll see more sort of like semi circles and the reason behind that is just naturally because i'm turning in the vr space

210
0:15:23.780 --> 0:15:31.300
We end up with semi circles. Whereas if we look at someone with a red print or ryvi's tool tip, then you'll see uh squares or rectangles

211
0:15:31.300 --> 0:15:34.500
Uh, salazu says, how are you doing today? I have the biggest mug of green tea

212
0:15:34.500 --> 0:15:36.740
I think I put too many leaves in because it's very strong

213
0:15:37.060 --> 0:15:39.700
I don't really know how much loose tea you're meant to put in

214
0:15:39.940 --> 0:15:40.900
Last time I looked it up

215
0:15:40.900 --> 0:15:44.500
It was like two to three grams a cup and then I like put two grams of like

216
0:15:44.900 --> 0:15:50.100
Loose leaf tea into like a weighing scale. I'm just like that's a lot. That's like that's a lot of tea

217
0:15:50.100 --> 0:15:53.940
So I need to look it up again. Yep. Erin says why not take advantage of 3d space?

218
0:15:53.940 --> 0:15:58.740
I totally agree as well. There's sometimes where I go like completely parallel to what i'm doing with the logics

219
0:15:58.740 --> 0:16:02.500
Comes up with like right nodes a lot and in some cases relays as well

220
0:16:02.500 --> 0:16:08.020
I'm like, hey this ribbon's in the way i'll do a relay and then i'll just like shove it in the z direction behind my

221
0:16:08.020 --> 0:16:09.540
Nodes and then it looks great

222
0:16:09.540 --> 0:16:13.860
I know people do the whole thing where they're like i'm going to wrap it around the outside like it's some sort of like network

223
0:16:14.100 --> 0:16:16.420
Cable in a data center that's cool, too

224
0:16:16.420 --> 0:16:22.660
But it usually uses like five relays or if I just add one relay shove it in the z direction that it's like out the way

225
0:16:22.660 --> 0:16:28.660
Thinker says they use a sphere line on their logic sometimes. Yep. I sinned that one totally sinned that one

226
0:16:29.300 --> 0:16:31.300
Don't advise doing it

227
0:16:31.860 --> 0:16:37.060
Specs says if bits of logics don't need to talk to each other keep them modular need to pass data between logics dynamic impulses

228
0:16:37.060 --> 0:16:42.500
And dynamic variables, maybe your friends cannot agree more dynamic variables the parent data system even value fields

229
0:16:42.500 --> 0:16:45.220
This is what we used to use before dynamic variables. They're all fine

230
0:16:45.220 --> 0:16:49.060
They're all ways to think about logic more modular when you're building your next data center

231
0:16:49.060 --> 0:16:55.700
They're all ways to think about logic more modular when you're building your next logic thing also think about a concept called the separation of concerns

232
0:16:56.100 --> 0:16:59.860
Um, you see this coming up a lot in um sort of website design and stuff like that

233
0:16:59.940 --> 0:17:02.420
You'll see uh things like mvc mvvm

234
0:17:02.900 --> 0:17:06.260
Throwing around model view control and stuff like that. I do want to do a video on that one

235
0:17:06.260 --> 0:17:09.620
But again, it's a difficult topic because it's like it's basically computer science theory

236
0:17:09.940 --> 0:17:13.540
Um, and so it's just like hey, i'm not building a space laser here

237
0:17:13.620 --> 0:17:17.060
I'm, just talking at you and showing you empty objects and talking about them

238
0:17:17.060 --> 0:17:20.820
So i'm trying to think of a good way to do that. I guess an example here

239
0:17:20.900 --> 0:17:23.620
um, I could probably try and explain would be like, um

240
0:17:24.260 --> 0:17:29.060
Uh, like a flip book or like a slideshow or like a powerpoint that you might have inside neos

241
0:17:29.140 --> 0:17:36.260
um, what I would see a lot of times is uh, people would have maybe a variable value register in logics and then they would have

242
0:17:36.820 --> 0:17:38.580
um button

243
0:17:38.580 --> 0:17:41.060
Event nodes hooking up to that variable

244
0:17:41.460 --> 0:17:44.100
Uh, and so if they add a next and previous button

245
0:17:44.100 --> 0:17:51.540
Um, they've got two button events nodes two right nodes modifying that variable that then drives which page we're on on this powerpoint or whatever

246
0:17:51.940 --> 0:17:56.420
Uh instead if you just made a dynamic variable or even a value field you won't need any objects

247
0:17:56.500 --> 0:18:04.180
You could just use the common ui button value set or button value, uh cycle or delta components to just do that. And um

248
0:18:04.900 --> 0:18:10.500
Then when you're referring to the uh, the slide the powerpoint slide, which would use a boolean switcher

249
0:18:10.500 --> 0:18:14.340
You can just again use a dynamic variable and then you won't even have a logic connecting to that

250
0:18:14.420 --> 0:18:18.100
You just have like everything's just wireless. It's great. Maybe i'll build that that's a good example

251
0:18:18.260 --> 0:18:22.840
We'll build it two ways. I can build it in the tutorial like how I would build it in 2019

252
0:18:22.980 --> 0:18:26.020
And then how I would build in 2022 that might be a good example

253
0:18:26.340 --> 0:18:32.340
I should like put a black and white filter on the camera and be like back in 2019. Here's how I would build this slide

254
0:18:33.220 --> 0:18:36.500
System now, it's 2022. Here's how I would build it

255
0:18:36.500 --> 0:18:42.980
Maybe get a mustache for the 2019 version as well. Uh, anyway, let's move on before I giggle too much. Um,

256
0:18:43.780 --> 0:18:50.100
Lego, uh asks how much of Neos is logics and how much is components? Um, everything is components because logics is components

257
0:18:50.660 --> 0:18:52.660
blinks and smiles

258
0:18:52.980 --> 0:18:54.340
No, um

259
0:18:54.340 --> 0:18:57.940
It depends what you're looking at. So a good example here might be the world browser

260
0:18:57.940 --> 0:18:59.940
So the world browser is 100 percent components

261
0:18:59.940 --> 0:19:05.460
But the reason it can be 100 percent components is that there are components that are specifically, uh targeting fetching world information

262
0:19:05.460 --> 0:19:08.740
World information and you can actually take a look at them just inspect the world browser

263
0:19:08.740 --> 0:19:13.780
It's actually kind of cool seeing how that works because that's how I learned how dynamic variables are meant to work because I saw how

264
0:19:13.860 --> 0:19:15.860
Fricks was using them, basically

265
0:19:16.260 --> 0:19:21.300
Then when it comes down to things that people make it really does depend there are um

266
0:19:21.700 --> 0:19:27.700
Some component purists who refuse to use logics and seem to be miss spreading the misinformation that logic is bad and I hate them

267
0:19:27.700 --> 0:19:31.700
So please stop doing that if that's one of you if you're using components because they're helpful you don't use logics

268
0:19:31.700 --> 0:19:36.180
That's great. But please don't go around telling people that logics is bad. Tell them that it is useful for certain

269
0:19:36.740 --> 0:19:37.780
aspects

270
0:19:37.780 --> 0:19:39.780
Um, I noticed that most of the people

271
0:19:39.860 --> 0:19:44.580
Um, I speak to these days are those people they're like, hey you lose whatever you need to do

272
0:19:44.580 --> 0:19:48.180
What's gets gets doing but there are still people I meet who are like, yep

273
0:19:48.180 --> 0:19:52.580
So and so told me that logics is bad and I shouldn't use it and i'm just like I don't know who you are or where

274
0:19:52.580 --> 0:19:55.300
You're from but stop telling people that please please

275
0:19:55.860 --> 0:20:01.540
Um, just take a look around as well like the default headset avatar. For example, it has some logics on it

276
0:20:01.540 --> 0:20:04.340
Um that controls the uh, the voice range

277
0:20:04.980 --> 0:20:09.700
Some of the the profile pictures look at the recent video I published about the profile picture

278
0:20:09.860 --> 0:20:13.540
Um getting that the same piece of logics I demonstrate on that

279
0:20:13.780 --> 0:20:18.820
Um is actually in place on that default avatar to uh, get that picture onto the front of it. For example

280
0:20:19.220 --> 0:20:24.980
Uh kobold says, uh, what in the hell is a color print or backing i'm still getting started with logics

281
0:20:24.980 --> 0:20:31.540
Uh yuki for anyone else there that is in game. Could you drop a screenshot of a red print in the game?

282
0:20:31.780 --> 0:20:34.020
and then if anyone has a um

283
0:20:34.820 --> 0:20:37.620
Link to business lawyers tutorial series on the red print

284
0:20:37.620 --> 0:20:43.140
Please go ahead and link the the like first episode or the playlist for that so we can get that into the chat for kobold

285
0:20:43.620 --> 0:20:44.640
moving

286
0:20:44.640 --> 0:20:46.640
forwards, um

287
0:20:46.740 --> 0:20:53.140
Foxworth talks about mono packing do not mono pack. So mono pack came from this um information that slots are bad

288
0:20:53.140 --> 0:20:57.860
And therefore we should put all the logics onto one slot and I believe it's a plug-in or a mod

289
0:20:57.940 --> 0:21:03.860
I don't really care these days. It's bad. Whatever it is, and it will collapse all of the logics components into one slot

290
0:21:04.180 --> 0:21:05.700
It is terrible. Do not use it

291
0:21:05.700 --> 0:21:09.060
one of the reasons why logics needs to be on multiple slots is so that um

292
0:21:09.460 --> 0:21:12.900
Us as neos can understand it when you're loading it a little bit easier

293
0:21:13.140 --> 0:21:16.500
And we can figure it out and we can do stuff with it. Um

294
0:21:17.060 --> 0:21:19.060
You may sometimes see for example

295
0:21:19.060 --> 0:21:22.840
Uh a node which is named injective for backwards compatibility

296
0:21:23.140 --> 0:21:28.660
That is what's happened when I think it's the fine char by name node got an additional field which changed its meaning

297
0:21:29.060 --> 0:21:35.940
We put in code which looks for old fine char by name nodes when it's loaded and adds that boolean such backwards

298
0:21:36.160 --> 0:21:42.420
Compatibility is preserved if you mono pack it's more difficult for us to do stuff like that. It probably still work

299
0:21:42.900 --> 0:21:45.540
But because we need to add a node to your setup

300
0:21:45.540 --> 0:21:52.180
It's like well how we we don't understand where it goes because the the the what like what it will make a mess. Um

301
0:21:52.740 --> 0:21:55.620
Adding on to that slots do not cause performance issues

302
0:21:55.700 --> 0:22:01.780
Here's a good way to think about it before you look at the slot count of your avatar look at the functionality count

303
0:22:01.940 --> 0:22:06.900
So as an example here, um, oh look my avatar is five thousand slots. That's bad

304
0:22:06.980 --> 0:22:12.420
actually, it's not the that's a symptom not the cause the cause is you have a

305
0:22:13.280 --> 0:22:14.500
nuclear

306
0:22:14.500 --> 0:22:17.780
orbital defense platform on your avatar that floats

307
0:22:18.560 --> 0:22:22.660
7000 meters above your avatar and can summon nuclear missiles down to the floor when you push

308
0:22:23.140 --> 0:22:27.220
Uh when you do the finger gun gesture because you know hand gestures are cool these days

309
0:22:27.700 --> 0:22:33.700
Um, that is the problem that is causing your avatar to lag not the slot count if you remove your nuclear

310
0:22:34.100 --> 0:22:40.260
Missile defense orbital platform your avatar will not lag anymore. So it's the last thing to look at on the list

311
0:22:40.260 --> 0:22:44.180
Uh slots don't inherently cause performance problems. So don't worry about it

312
0:22:44.260 --> 0:22:46.660
We do have some optimizations to do on that place

313
0:22:46.660 --> 0:22:51.780
But if you're going to start bullying people because their slot count don't don't bully anyone for any reason

314
0:22:51.940 --> 0:22:52.180
I mean

315
0:22:52.180 --> 0:22:55.860
But like if you're going to start looking at someone's avatar and advising them performance

316
0:22:56.260 --> 0:23:02.980
Start with what the avatar does or does not do you'll get a lot more benefit if you reduce the texture scale

317
0:23:03.300 --> 0:23:08.900
If you reduce the material count if you reduce the amount of blend shapes or if you remove their nuclear missile defense orbital platform

318
0:23:08.900 --> 0:23:11.540
Like you don't need if you don't need it

319
0:23:12.100 --> 0:23:17.700
Ideally, like maybe shouldn't be on your avatar. So yellow now asks. Can you move the origin of a mesh in game?

320
0:23:18.260 --> 0:23:20.260
No, not currently

321
0:23:20.580 --> 0:23:26.100
You can do what's called create pivot center and you can also do that sort of manually if you want other style of pivots

322
0:23:26.340 --> 0:23:31.220
What that does is it creates a slot above the avatar above the mesh

323
0:23:31.620 --> 0:23:35.380
And then parents the mesh to that slot and then you can move them around separately

324
0:23:35.380 --> 0:23:42.420
so if you've got the parent slot in this case the pivot you can then move the mesh relative to that and change its pivot and

325
0:23:42.420 --> 0:23:46.340
Then when you move that parent slot it becomes the pivot create pivot center is really good

326
0:23:46.580 --> 0:23:50.420
That reminds me if you're a 3d modeler, please look at origins on your models

327
0:23:50.420 --> 0:23:55.780
I am tired of importing like an axe and the origin being like 50 000 meters to the bottom left of the axe

328
0:23:56.020 --> 0:24:00.900
The origin of an axe model should be in the middle of the handle blade. Thank you model creators

329
0:24:00.900 --> 0:24:07.300
Uh ozi asks, how does max texture set max max texture setting and a textures inspector work? I was really confused on

330
0:24:08.580 --> 0:24:11.380
Who who does the process compression for it?

331
0:24:11.460 --> 0:24:16.420
If it's locally completed in the cloud you do it and then you submit it back to the cloud to do the work

332
0:24:16.580 --> 0:24:21.140
As far as i'm aware, that's the one that like, uh changes the size, right?

333
0:24:21.700 --> 0:24:26.980
Not get me a screenshot if i'm mistaken. I might be mistaken there. Anyway, moving on. Uh

334
0:24:26.980 --> 0:24:33.620
Uh rameon asks on the topic of networking a significant desync with users connecting with high latency, uh, e.g

335
0:24:33.700 --> 0:24:38.420
NZ AU client european host does need to have some kind of prioritization with at least a higher paying users

336
0:24:38.740 --> 0:24:41.220
Accumulating mobile queue packets over time. Uh

337
0:24:41.860 --> 0:24:45.540
Not quite sure what causes the queued packets on like a network level

338
0:24:46.020 --> 0:24:52.500
um, I do know is that what we'll see a lot in sessions like that is um what I call

339
0:24:53.140 --> 0:24:55.700
Consider it's the wrong word because it's like weird. Um

340
0:24:55.700 --> 0:24:57.540
We'll just call it noisy playing, right?

341
0:24:57.540 --> 0:25:00.580
So if you're in a session with people that are on the other side of the planet

342
0:25:00.900 --> 0:25:06.180
Maybe don't spawn 7 000 youtube videos into the world because they'll end up desyncing

343
0:25:06.500 --> 0:25:12.260
Maybe don't spawn half your inventory into the world because they'll end up desyncing if you spawn like one object per minute

344
0:25:12.820 --> 0:25:16.260
They'll probably keep synced if you spawn 10 objects per minute

345
0:25:16.260 --> 0:25:22.180
They're probably going to desync so so do keep that in mind when you're when you're interacting with nz and au from europe

346
0:25:22.180 --> 0:25:27.780
From europe, I see that a lot. Um, especially with new players are maybe having trouble learning the game

347
0:25:28.260 --> 0:25:32.740
Um, I mean spawning lots of stuff for new players that are new to the game is is bad for other reasons

348
0:25:32.820 --> 0:25:39.220
As in you're overwhelming them, but it's also bad for performance reasons, right? You're unloading like half the inventory into the world

349
0:25:39.300 --> 0:25:43.620
It's a lot of data to to sync and remember they've never seen that object before

350
0:25:43.860 --> 0:25:48.180
So whilst it might load instantly for you because it's never been sinned by them before

351
0:25:48.180 --> 0:25:51.860
Everything's going to load so for them, especially if it's got like 4k textures on it or whatever

352
0:25:52.180 --> 0:25:57.060
Because like crusher's got a uh, a decent github issue. So do take a look at that one as well

353
0:25:57.540 --> 0:25:59.620
Uh another question from pooshka. Um

354
0:26:00.340 --> 0:26:04.980
Follow up question. Are there any plans for double precision support for physics transform rendering?

355
0:26:04.980 --> 0:26:10.580
That should allow for less glitches when you're extremely small when you're further. Yeah, it's in it's in issues. Um

356
0:26:11.300 --> 0:26:13.380
I don't know what the approach there would be

357
0:26:13.380 --> 0:26:19.540
I know that uh for x's plans to sort of completely upgrade the data model that we're using that's that giant spreadsheet in the you know

358
0:26:19.700 --> 0:26:21.700
Google docs. That's the spreadsheet. It's called the data model

359
0:26:22.420 --> 0:26:26.180
Um to make that more efficient and have more features that might then allow for double precision

360
0:26:26.260 --> 0:26:29.860
I'm, not entirely sure what our priority on that one would be or the process of that one

361
0:26:30.180 --> 0:26:32.500
It seems like it'll be quite big. I have to dig in and take a look at that one

362
0:26:32.980 --> 0:26:37.300
And then you say how far is it from implementation? We don't give etas currently see the announcements channel. I'm, so sorry

363
0:26:37.860 --> 0:26:39.860
uh moving forwards

364
0:26:39.860 --> 0:26:41.860
Forwards, um

365
0:26:42.820 --> 0:26:46.600
Tony says which of the compression methods for textures is most optimal to be used on avatars

366
0:26:47.140 --> 0:26:51.700
That's again a point of contention, right? So if you put it on an anisotropic I can never pronounce that

367
0:26:51.700 --> 0:26:55.480
Sometimes I call it anisotropic and i'm like that's not how it's pronounced anisotropy

368
0:26:57.140 --> 0:27:01.080
Whatever that one is that one will give you the best result but is technically the least performant

369
0:27:01.780 --> 0:27:04.580
And then trilinear or bilinear are are good

370
0:27:04.580 --> 0:27:11.960
Generally bilinear is better for performance than trilinear because bi means two tri means three. Um, so bi will do its

371
0:27:12.480 --> 0:27:19.320
Processing twice and tri will do it three times anisotopic will do it differently. And so therefore there's more effort there

372
0:27:19.720 --> 0:27:25.720
Uh, so if you want to do most optimal point, yeah there I said it if you want to do most optimal point based compression

373
0:27:26.040 --> 0:27:28.840
Your avatar is going to look terrible, but that's the most optimal

374
0:27:28.840 --> 0:27:34.280
Cool woohoo moving forwards, uh, asin says we know logic components

375
0:27:34.280 --> 0:27:37.160
It's just easier to claim to do two separate things. I do agree

376
0:27:37.560 --> 0:27:41.000
Um, it's just when questions come up about which is like more optimal

377
0:27:41.160 --> 0:27:46.040
The answer is is both right if you're like I want to learn logic or i'll learn components great

378
0:27:46.120 --> 0:27:48.600
I'll help you out if you're like which is more optimal both

379
0:27:49.080 --> 0:27:53.480
um oracle says i'm only a week in and people have told me that logic is a bit of a thing to jump into but

380
0:27:53.560 --> 0:27:57.480
It's pretty amazing thing once you get the hang of it. Have you had anyone say logic is bad fantastic

381
0:27:57.480 --> 0:27:59.640
That might be dying. I don't know. Um

382
0:28:00.200 --> 0:28:03.000
One of the problems I see when people learn logic is they go too big for example

383
0:28:03.000 --> 0:28:07.400
It's like I want to learn logic so I can make a gun. That's a big project

384
0:28:07.640 --> 0:28:11.480
I want to learn logic so I can add two numbers together. It'll take you 20 minutes

385
0:28:11.560 --> 0:28:14.840
Like I don't I don't know how other people are teaching logic

386
0:28:14.840 --> 0:28:18.760
But i'm just like here is the plus node adds two numbers together once you've got the hang of that

387
0:28:19.160 --> 0:28:21.320
We'll go on to some more complicated stuff

388
0:28:21.320 --> 0:28:27.160
But what I want to do by doing that is to get used to the ui like when we're doing advanced spaghetti everywhere

389
0:28:27.240 --> 0:28:31.240
On a red plinth blue plinth purple print whatever print you want for or not doesn't matter

390
0:28:31.480 --> 0:28:37.080
But when we're doing really complicated logics, I don't want us to be thinking about how we connect ribbons how we disconnect ribbons

391
0:28:37.160 --> 0:28:42.920
So I show people the plus node and I say look you can connect numbers to the plus node and get a result

392
0:28:43.320 --> 0:28:47.800
Get used to the ui get used to the ribbons get used to like the the visuals

393
0:28:47.800 --> 0:28:54.120
and then we'll cover other nodes and that way the the the ui shouldn't be a barrier there because I do see that problem as

394
0:28:54.120 --> 0:28:55.880
Well, it's like ah and to make a gun

395
0:28:55.880 --> 0:28:59.480
We're getting a ribbon here and a ribbon here and a ribbon here and the user doesn't even know how to make one ribbon

396
0:28:59.560 --> 0:29:07.240
That's a problem. Thanks to alex who has linked the uh, the youtube playlist with uh business lawyer and uclop. Thank you for that

397
0:29:07.800 --> 0:29:10.040
Uh, so take a look at that. Uh

398
0:29:11.560 --> 0:29:15.320
Cobalt probably best if you meet up with someone in game to take a look at the red print

399
0:29:15.320 --> 0:29:21.400
Uh in game someone can show you it and then olin has a picture of the red print. Um, so you'll see in um,

400
0:29:21.960 --> 0:29:26.760
Um alan olin's oden's picture. There is a red print in the world there and you'll see it's a grid

401
0:29:27.080 --> 0:29:30.040
Um that grid is expandable and when you put nodes near it

402
0:29:30.120 --> 0:29:32.360
Those nodes will snap onto a surface surface of it

403
0:29:32.440 --> 0:29:38.520
you can think of it a little bit like doing a jigsaw puzzle or playing dominoes rather than what logics usually is which is like

404
0:29:38.520 --> 0:29:45.080
Ah, yes, this magical floating card will connect to this other magical floating card, which is ever so slightly off rotation

405
0:29:45.480 --> 0:29:47.480
And so therefore the ribbons look terrible

406
0:29:48.120 --> 0:29:55.400
Electronus says nuclear launch detected if anyone adds a missile platform to their avatar. I will I will I will be angry

407
0:29:55.800 --> 0:30:00.440
I did this avatar this avatar idea once of being like could I mess with the lasers?

408
0:30:00.520 --> 0:30:03.260
You know the lasers that come out of your hands when using tools, etc

409
0:30:03.260 --> 0:30:08.940
Etc. Could those come from really high up? I wouldn't like model a spaceship or whatever and put it up there

410
0:30:09.100 --> 0:30:13.100
But it'll be like law wise like yeah a satellite does my logic, right?

411
0:30:13.180 --> 0:30:16.700
So the laser would come from a high point position in the world

412
0:30:17.020 --> 0:30:21.820
And that would be where the like the nodes and everything is moved from i'll keep it the same

413
0:30:21.820 --> 0:30:27.420
So like you yourself using it wouldn't have any sort of adaptation, but it would just look like

414
0:30:27.980 --> 0:30:31.900
Satellites moving your objects around etc. All right moving onwards to erin's question

415
0:30:31.900 --> 0:30:35.580
Whatever your way to prevent people from reading a lot of dicks or getting assets from the creation of yours. Um

416
0:30:36.140 --> 0:30:39.100
Assets, so when you're talking about assets, you're talking about avatar stealing

417
0:30:39.420 --> 0:30:45.020
And so when you're talking about avatar stealing, we will do our best to continue to add improvements to that system

418
0:30:45.980 --> 0:30:51.660
Our next best improvement to this asset theft and stuff like that is the license system having said that though

419
0:30:51.660 --> 0:30:53.820
There is no way to 100

420
0:30:54.840 --> 0:30:59.020
Guarantee that something will not be stolen from you if you think that that's possible

421
0:30:59.020 --> 0:31:04.780
I want you to look at the latest triple-a game that has launched and has its assets in neos already because someone has ripped them

422
0:31:05.100 --> 0:31:07.660
Um, you know these triple-a games are having their assets ripped

423
0:31:08.300 --> 0:31:11.980
There's even things now which can like dump gpu memory to rip assets

424
0:31:11.980 --> 0:31:16.700
So it's like oh you've got this drm in your game. Everyone hates great. I'll just dump the gpu memory

425
0:31:17.020 --> 0:31:22.060
When it goes beyond that like hey, maybe someone's going to actually just get like some tiny copper wires

426
0:31:22.540 --> 0:31:25.420
Solder them to an active graphics card and dump it that way

427
0:31:25.420 --> 0:31:33.500
Like, you know a certain point the graphics card gets told there is a triangle here and it looks like your character's colors, etc

428
0:31:33.740 --> 0:31:38.460
And if they can pull that data out the graphics card, they can reconstruct that into a model

429
0:31:38.860 --> 0:31:43.740
We will do our best the way that we're doing actually puts us a slight benefit from

430
0:31:44.380 --> 0:31:49.100
Other places in that you can't really export an avatar once it's in it sort of gets garbled

431
0:31:49.260 --> 0:31:52.780
So, um what that allows us to do is if there is a theft that occurs

432
0:31:52.780 --> 0:31:57.580
You can report it to moderation and we do have the ability to sort of see where it's gone and track its progression

433
0:31:57.980 --> 0:31:59.980
That will get better with that license system

434
0:31:59.980 --> 0:32:04.780
I talk about that will enable us to sort of find manage and and spot thefts a lot easier

435
0:32:06.060 --> 0:32:07.980
As for modifying the logics on your avatar

436
0:32:07.980 --> 0:32:13.100
there is a system called hard permissions which sort of interplays with the license system a little bit and sort of says like

437
0:32:13.500 --> 0:32:17.580
Hey, maybe you can't access this part of the world and the license system is like hey

438
0:32:17.580 --> 0:32:22.060
You can't modify this avatar and that will kind of lock it down and bake it up a little bit

439
0:32:22.060 --> 0:32:24.060
It's similar to how um

440
0:32:24.700 --> 0:32:29.340
Like the the the verbal rules of a session might work, you know in in a session might be like hey

441
0:32:29.660 --> 0:32:34.240
Don't don't do this. So i'm going to kick you out like but more enforced in terms of technicalities

442
0:32:34.460 --> 0:32:36.460
We don't know the final way that that's going to work

443
0:32:36.540 --> 0:32:41.420
What the ui will look like what the protections look like how to apply or anything like that because we're still designing the system

444
0:32:41.660 --> 0:32:44.540
but once it's there you can bet that uh

445
0:32:45.100 --> 0:32:50.060
There'll be tutorials from a certain someone so cobalt says so tdr on the slot thing. The slots aren't the issue

446
0:32:50.060 --> 0:32:55.260
It's what's in those slots perfect analogy there at a certain level the slots become an issue

447
0:32:55.740 --> 0:33:00.860
But the amount of slots there before you need an issue is because you've added that launch platform

448
0:33:00.940 --> 0:33:04.140
So just remove that remove remove the launch platform. Yeah

449
0:33:04.700 --> 0:33:09.420
I think it says my avatar is not laggy as a quote and then says proceeds to have 8k psd or tiff textures

450
0:33:09.640 --> 0:33:12.540
uncompressed in direct load in every logic system known to man

451
0:33:13.240 --> 0:33:15.240
exactly what i'm referring to

452
0:33:15.660 --> 0:33:17.500
If you have 8k textures

453
0:33:17.500 --> 0:33:20.960
You better have a good reason for it and it better look fantastic

454
0:33:21.340 --> 0:33:25.580
It better not just be a two color palette that has 8k textures for no reason

455
0:33:26.140 --> 0:33:29.660
So alan says how to improve forward speed or sloshy avatar. No delete all systems

456
0:33:29.980 --> 0:33:34.620
Okay, if you want to really really really perform with avatar delete your systems. It should just be a character, right?

457
0:33:34.940 --> 0:33:40.300
It can have gestures it can you know look like you it can have blend shapes but bake the ones you don't need

458
0:33:40.700 --> 0:33:42.700
But does it really need?

459
0:33:42.780 --> 0:33:43.740
um

460
0:33:43.740 --> 0:33:49.420
Your heart rate in the name badge above you. Does it really need like your favorite sandwich in the name plate above you?

461
0:33:49.820 --> 0:33:52.460
Does it need a gun which summons?

462
0:33:53.980 --> 0:33:58.940
Noah's ark and all the animals come off noah's ark and make their animal noises and then kill someone

463
0:33:59.340 --> 0:34:01.340
It doesn't need that like let's remove that

464
0:34:01.740 --> 0:34:08.700
Like that that's like remove that sorry says should make a macro that pays blend shape baking tutorial when erect joins i've tried that. Um,

465
0:34:08.700 --> 0:34:14.540
It doesn't work like there's I sometimes when I host a session there's like information at the spawn about how to bake blend shapes

466
0:34:14.860 --> 0:34:15.420
Zek asks

467
0:34:15.420 --> 0:34:18.140
Is it possible to edit the lasers to come off your hands the ones that you select with this?

468
0:34:18.220 --> 0:34:19.740
I tried finding an inspector but had no luck

469
0:34:19.740 --> 0:34:25.740
My only thought was it might be possible if someone accidentally soft locked themselves somewhere there it is possible. Those are called tool anchors

470
0:34:26.060 --> 0:34:29.660
Um, i'll get the video for that that is if someone hasn't beaten me to it

471
0:34:30.300 --> 0:34:35.020
Actually, i'll just say please go for it get the the tool anchor video that I have and link it to um

472
0:34:35.020 --> 0:34:40.300
And get to zek for me cobble says there's a model. Please. Please do that. Yep. That's referring to to origins

473
0:34:40.380 --> 0:34:44.540
I am so far behind on the text here because i'm just answering questions and wittering on. Um

474
0:34:45.260 --> 0:34:49.100
Okay, uh epic eastern has a question. Is this an optimized emote system?

475
0:34:49.740 --> 0:34:55.900
Hmm. So, uh, that's an interesting idea like I did think about having a segment where we're like let's review logic

476
0:34:56.060 --> 0:34:59.900
But I didn't want anyone to feel bad, but I will take a look just just don't feel bad if it's bad

477
0:34:59.900 --> 0:35:01.900
Okay, let me take a look. Uh

478
0:35:02.060 --> 0:35:04.060
found true

479
0:35:04.060 --> 0:35:06.060
Okay, he's a self alpha

480
0:35:06.300 --> 0:35:07.820
right latch

481
0:35:07.820 --> 0:35:11.580
Right, let's try that. Try that looks good to me particularly like the use of right latch

482
0:35:11.660 --> 0:35:16.140
Do you remember right latches there? Sometimes I see people do boolean latch of a um, a ternary node

483
0:35:16.220 --> 0:35:19.260
I'm, like it's kind of the same thing as a right latch. So maybe use a right latch

484
0:35:19.580 --> 0:35:21.580
Uh dorky says on the topic of having a lot of blend shapes

485
0:35:21.580 --> 0:35:24.960
I recall hearing that the impact is when it's over zero due to vertex calculations

486
0:35:25.260 --> 0:35:29.260
There are multiple types of of impact with having multiple blend shapes. So

487
0:35:29.260 --> 0:35:33.820
Yes, if it's over zero, there's some cost for doing that if it's moving

488
0:35:33.820 --> 0:35:37.980
There's some cost to doing that but there is also some cost to have that data in there

489
0:35:38.220 --> 0:35:42.540
I don't know exactly the specifics internally, but imagine it like, um

490
0:35:43.340 --> 0:35:47.580
I guess like a mask, right? So imagine that each blend shape on top of your face is a mask

491
0:35:47.660 --> 0:35:53.180
So the smiling blend shape is a mask on top of your non-smiling shape and then your frowny blend shape is another mask on top

492
0:35:53.180 --> 0:35:58.460
Of that right? So by the time you get to like 50 facial blend shapes, you're wearing 50 masks

493
0:35:58.460 --> 0:36:03.420
That's kind of difficult. Like, you know, there's videos where the youtuber's put on t-shirts and keep putting them on

494
0:36:03.660 --> 0:36:06.380
That's body blend shapes for you. You're wearing 50 t-shirts

495
0:36:06.380 --> 0:36:11.100
So when you load into the world neos has to load those 50 t-shirts and that's why there's a hitch

496
0:36:11.420 --> 0:36:15.900
Like there is a cost for that data being there wherever it's on or not. It's in memory, etc

497
0:36:16.220 --> 0:36:22.080
electrona says opinion using something like value copy with right back to make fields local for things like set global transform

498
0:36:22.380 --> 0:36:25.900
As far as testing is shown it means the rights never get synced. Uh,

499
0:36:25.900 --> 0:36:30.220
It depends what you're doing. I don't know what you're doing. If you tell me what you're doing

500
0:36:30.620 --> 0:36:32.780
It might be like a better way of doing it

501
0:36:33.180 --> 0:36:37.900
Specs asks is there a known cause for the infinite loading bug referring to you and users intimate the joint sessions and experience and asset

502
0:36:37.980 --> 0:36:40.300
Loading count that grows forever never goes away. Um

503
0:36:41.020 --> 0:36:47.500
There's something up with asset loading. I don't know what's causing it and I see like multiple things there where I want to look into

504
0:36:47.500 --> 0:36:48.140
them

505
0:36:48.140 --> 0:36:50.140
um, I keep talking to um

506
0:36:50.140 --> 0:36:56.060
Fruits, etc about like improving the logging there. So we know what's going on. Um, I did see a commit from fruits

507
0:36:56.060 --> 0:36:59.500
That hit the source code recently that may help with that a little bit

508
0:36:59.820 --> 0:37:01.820
But I do know that that still happens

509
0:37:01.980 --> 0:37:07.760
I don't think that I know enough about it to say that there is a known cause though. No egg roll for says anisotropic

510
0:37:08.380 --> 0:37:14.060
Thank you. I'm gonna forget that though. Maybe I should like print that and frame it. I might print that and frame it anyway

511
0:37:14.060 --> 0:37:19.420
Um, ozi says i'm talking about filter options not compression methods. Oh, i'm, sorry. Um, so

512
0:37:23.500 --> 0:37:25.020
Point filtering

513
0:37:25.020 --> 0:37:29.180
Texture compression. I don't remember what the texture compression options look like on a texture

514
0:37:29.260 --> 0:37:34.620
I'm, sorry if it'll get me a picture of the static. I'm sure I remember I just can't like visualize it

515
0:37:35.340 --> 0:37:42.480
Hamish is trying to trick me up here because I pronounce stuff weirdly. Um, they're asking how would you iterate through a bunch of anisosopic?

516
0:37:42.480 --> 0:37:49.460
I can't I can't I can't like either of those words are just difficult. Um, you don't need to there's no such thing as an anisosopic

517
0:37:50.000 --> 0:37:52.000
Um, whatever that is. Yeah, cool

518
0:37:52.240 --> 0:37:56.240
Uh elo says i've asked a person to walk me through making a laser gun. It sounded like a really really nice experience

519
0:37:56.560 --> 0:38:01.440
That's it depends on attitude. There's a lot of again problems I see in um, like how

520
0:38:02.080 --> 0:38:03.040
um

521
0:38:03.040 --> 0:38:09.600
How people approach systems so if you approach neos as I need to learn I want to learn please help me learn

522
0:38:09.600 --> 0:38:13.520
You'll have a lot better time and then maybe making a gun is a good experience

523
0:38:13.520 --> 0:38:17.920
But if you approach it with logics is hard. I don't know it. I want to learn it

524
0:38:18.240 --> 0:38:20.720
Please make a laser gun then you'll have a worse time

525
0:38:20.960 --> 0:38:23.840
That's why I usually go with the like let's learn the the specifics

526
0:38:24.080 --> 0:38:28.480
You know in in in education where you learn the theory before you learn the application a little bit like that

527
0:38:28.880 --> 0:38:34.960
Le cvr says why is neon so hard to get the hang of but chill out is easy to use depends on your perspective. So

528
0:38:34.960 --> 0:38:39.920
Um chill out is more aligned to how the the vr chat experience works

529
0:38:40.000 --> 0:38:45.920
And so it's a it's a better sort of jumping off point for vr chat users. Um neos isn't

530
0:38:46.560 --> 0:38:53.120
Hard in some avenues it is hard in other avenues. I do admit it's just again like an attitude thing though

531
0:38:53.280 --> 0:38:59.280
So you need to like look at neos as a completely different beast to vr chat cvr and stuff like that

532
0:38:59.680 --> 0:39:03.760
You're not comparing the two as much when you're comparing how they are to use

533
0:39:03.760 --> 0:39:09.760
You're just learning them in isolation. So an example might be hey bring in avatar in

534
0:39:09.920 --> 0:39:14.160
Yeah, the first time I brought an avatar and it took me like two hours, but the now it takes me five minutes

535
0:39:14.560 --> 0:39:16.400
It's like it's an attitude and learning thing

536
0:39:16.400 --> 0:39:18.080
Like I know the first time's hard

537
0:39:18.080 --> 0:39:23.120
We've got mentors standing by in game all the time to help you get an avatar in but once you've done it like

538
0:39:23.520 --> 0:39:27.840
A few times it's going to get easier once you've been doing it for almost four years like me

539
0:39:27.920 --> 0:39:31.840
It's just like yeah, sure. Come on, whatever erin says have you done the satellite laser thing?

540
0:39:31.840 --> 0:39:37.200
No, I did get close to it. But like not there yet spec says photogrammetry avatar theft

541
0:39:37.200 --> 0:39:40.160
You could technically do that right if you captured your screen

542
0:39:40.720 --> 0:39:47.040
And went around the avatar and then somehow filtered out the background you could photogrammetry recreate the avatar

543
0:39:47.360 --> 0:39:53.120
And then people say oh just block screenshots. Yeah, i've got a camera pointed at my screen. What are you going to do now?

544
0:39:53.280 --> 0:39:55.280
What are you going to do now? Um

545
0:39:55.840 --> 0:39:57.520
It's it's an interesting question

546
0:39:57.520 --> 0:40:04.240
if you do notice asset theft do report it to moderation team at moderation.nes.com we will do our best to figure out why that is and

547
0:40:05.040 --> 0:40:09.040
Act appropriately epic. Eason says what can you do with hard missions?

548
0:40:09.680 --> 0:40:11.680
Is making a map

549
0:40:11.680 --> 0:40:17.360
That you uh paid on gumroad or some other websites and people give builder and builders not be able to modify or export

550
0:40:17.680 --> 0:40:23.120
Any assets in the ah, that's hard permissions. Yeah, so the easiest way I can think of hard permissions is um

551
0:40:23.680 --> 0:40:26.240
Right now if you look at a world imagine it's a circle

552
0:40:26.240 --> 0:40:29.520
And you can edit everything inside that circle so you can just if you're a builder

553
0:40:29.520 --> 0:40:32.960
You can inspect that part of the world. You can inspect the floor. You can unpack the floor

554
0:40:32.960 --> 0:40:35.600
You can look at the logics in the floor with hard permissions

555
0:40:36.160 --> 0:40:39.040
Split that circle into two and you've got a venn diagram stuff

556
0:40:39.040 --> 0:40:42.800
You can edit and stuff you can't edit and then put various things in one of those circles

557
0:40:42.880 --> 0:40:48.800
So hey, maybe the floor you can't edit the floor for some reason there's proprietary technology in this floor

558
0:40:49.200 --> 0:40:53.760
You can't edit it. But hey, maybe the wall you can that's in the candidate circle

559
0:40:53.760 --> 0:40:56.240
That's the sort of way I visualize it

560
0:40:56.240 --> 0:40:59.840
Like I said again, it's not going to be a literal circle in game or the ui for it

561
0:41:00.000 --> 0:41:04.000
But that's the way you should like think about it. Like here's what you can and cannot do aaron says you

562
0:41:04.640 --> 0:41:08.160
Uh, I think you should do logics with you ask for permission if you feel you need it

563
0:41:08.160 --> 0:41:10.160
But I think it'd be a fantastic way to teach people

564
0:41:10.160 --> 0:41:11.840
A good example of that one is the hermit meter

565
0:41:11.840 --> 0:41:15.680
I recreated the hermit meter and halved the logics nodes that were used in the hermit meter

566
0:41:16.080 --> 0:41:19.360
I just looked at it and I went really and I halved the nodes that were at use

567
0:41:19.360 --> 0:41:24.160
I don't remember who made the original hermit meter. I do believe the one aaron has is my one. So

568
0:41:24.720 --> 0:41:27.920
Alex says yo active development hype. Yeah, there's there's still stuff happening

569
0:41:28.240 --> 0:41:33.280
Um, if anyone who thinks we're on strike, we're not if we're on strike. I wouldn't be here. I would be like in bed

570
0:41:33.840 --> 0:41:38.400
Uh, okay. We got i'm finally catching up to the the the compression stuff. Fantastic

571
0:41:38.640 --> 0:41:43.600
Oh the bc3 ragb stuff and then let's go pitch it. Yes. I have no idea

572
0:41:43.600 --> 0:41:49.040
Um, there are so many options there and some of them make my textures change to just blue so I don't know

573
0:41:49.360 --> 0:41:53.520
And then a just says neos will not be running if we weren't. Yeah, if it like of all people

574
0:41:53.680 --> 0:41:59.840
I want you to think about shifty. She tirelessly every day answers patron inquiries every single day

575
0:42:00.000 --> 0:42:06.080
Like it it's got to the point where she's had to like draw the line and set like start and end times for her day

576
0:42:06.560 --> 0:42:11.840
Just have some sort of sense of normality. That's not on strike. That's we care about the community

577
0:42:11.840 --> 0:42:16.720
We're doing what we can again. I've been sat here for 48 minutes answering random questions and saying the word

578
0:42:17.680 --> 0:42:21.520
orbital defense platform several times over we're not on strike, um

579
0:42:22.160 --> 0:42:27.360
Moving forwards miss kitty says, uh, how does one go learning logics for the first time?

580
0:42:27.760 --> 0:42:32.160
Um, I was talking about that earlier. Um, the best way I think is to keep things simple

581
0:42:32.480 --> 0:42:39.840
So your first logic project should be adding two numbers together. Maybe learn the ui right learn how to spawn a node how to

582
0:42:39.840 --> 0:42:45.920
um connect those nodes together how to disconnect those nodes how to view that result do that first

583
0:42:47.280 --> 0:42:54.020
Um, if you're not tech savvy the adding numbers together is it should should be quite easy it resembles

584
0:42:54.720 --> 0:42:56.720
Like how you were taught addition?

585
0:42:56.720 --> 0:43:01.680
Um, once you've got that going there are videos from other critters. I haven't done a beginner logics tutorial

586
0:43:01.760 --> 0:43:03.760
and that's the reason behind that is just because like

587
0:43:03.760 --> 0:43:09.600
I don't know how to approach tutorials for absolute beginners. Lots of my tutorials aren't for beginners. I do apologize for that

588
0:43:10.000 --> 0:43:13.280
It's just like there is a certain level of detail that you need to know

589
0:43:13.840 --> 0:43:17.040
before you watch one of my tutorials and that makes it easier to like

590
0:43:18.400 --> 0:43:22.960
Make them. Um, but basement has an amazing introduction to logics tutorial

591
0:43:23.360 --> 0:43:27.360
um, so if someone can link that whilst I look at some other questions, then uh,

592
0:43:27.840 --> 0:43:28.960
That should help you out there

593
0:43:28.960 --> 0:43:35.440
But I do think that you should keep things, uh as simple as possible to start adding numbers together. Great

594
0:43:35.600 --> 0:43:38.660
Then once you learn how to add numbers together, maybe do some multiplication

595
0:43:39.440 --> 0:43:42.480
And then once you've done some multiplication, maybe do some division, right?

596
0:43:42.480 --> 0:43:47.200
And then once you've done all of the mathematical operators, you should end up with some logics that you can do

597
0:43:47.440 --> 0:43:52.260
I seem to remember zane people know zane. They're the sort of blue wrecks that runs around wearing a hat and sunglasses

598
0:43:52.880 --> 0:43:58.160
Well, like glowy visor. It's not really a sunglasses, but it's glowing that brightly. I gave him a

599
0:43:58.160 --> 0:44:03.040
Uh subset of the node browser, which I have somewhere in my log public folder, I think and it

600
0:44:03.680 --> 0:44:05.520
um has

601
0:44:05.520 --> 0:44:10.960
Only mathematical notes and I just said play with these and um, he's playing with them

602
0:44:11.040 --> 0:44:11.760
They were cool

603
0:44:11.760 --> 0:44:16.640
And then I gave him the t node and the t node is it counts the number of seconds the world has been open

604
0:44:17.040 --> 0:44:19.040
And he started putting those together

605
0:44:19.040 --> 0:44:22.800
And eventually he got like a number that was just doing something and he's like, oh

606
0:44:22.800 --> 0:44:26.880
I wonder if I could make the number bigger and he like, you know added a multiplication node, etc

607
0:44:26.880 --> 0:44:31.280
So that that was cool. Like, you know, he just kept playing with maths until he got there

608
0:44:31.760 --> 0:44:38.880
Uh, dre says I will jump up to uh, dorky's question in just a second. But dre says, uh, what if you're bad at math?

609
0:44:39.280 --> 0:44:41.760
Uh, you can add two numbers together

610
0:44:41.920 --> 0:44:44.560
It's it's more like honestly, it's more about learning the ui

611
0:44:44.640 --> 0:44:48.000
Like if you learn the ui you'll have a lot better time when you start looking at other nodes

612
0:44:48.000 --> 0:44:53.040
Let's start looking at other concepts, but I again see a lot of times is I want to make a gun

613
0:44:53.040 --> 0:44:57.200
Well, okay. Can you link two nodes together? I can't and it's like, okay

614
0:44:57.280 --> 0:45:02.320
Let's let's try one plus one equals two in logic form just to learn the ui

615
0:45:02.560 --> 0:45:05.200
like i'm not trying to insult anyone's intelligence and say like

616
0:45:05.840 --> 0:45:09.120
You don't know how to add those numbers together. We all know how to do addition

617
0:45:09.520 --> 0:45:14.400
It's just that the ui and placing those nodes in the world and linking them up that I want you to learn

618
0:45:14.800 --> 0:45:18.240
Jumping up to dorky says can you explain anim j like i'm five?

619
0:45:18.240 --> 0:45:22.720
Uh, I keep seeing it mentioned try to understand it for all the wiki. I can't wrap my head around it

620
0:45:22.880 --> 0:45:26.720
Lex and I are working on updating the animation for that

621
0:45:27.120 --> 0:45:33.680
I spent four hours yesterday trying to figure out how matrix matrices work in nmj and my conclusion is they don't

622
0:45:34.000 --> 0:45:38.240
So that was fun. Um, but we are figuring bits of it out

623
0:45:38.640 --> 0:45:43.040
I'm going to go ahead and try though and the reason behind that is because I have a very simple nmj file

624
0:45:43.120 --> 0:45:47.200
I don't believe we've got any like shareable nmj files that we've shared before

625
0:45:47.200 --> 0:45:50.960
There are a couple of examples on the wiki, but they're like complicated or not easy to use

626
0:45:51.040 --> 0:45:53.520
Let me just go get my my sample nmj file

627
0:45:53.600 --> 0:45:56.080
I'm, not even gonna upload that as a file or I will provide it if you need it

628
0:45:56.400 --> 0:45:58.400
I'm going to just give it to you as a screenshot

629
0:45:58.720 --> 0:46:05.360
Um, simply because then we can talk about it a little bit easier and I should uh, i'm gonna go ahead and remove the top bit there

630
0:46:05.920 --> 0:46:12.560
Uh, and then load my screenshot a screenshotting tool, please load and then i'm gonna say to visual studio that this is jason

631
0:46:13.440 --> 0:46:16.240
There's that jason coming up by the way if you want to get ahead in the game

632
0:46:16.240 --> 0:46:21.040
if you want to get ahead in the game when it comes to um, basically any form of programming like if you're a

633
0:46:21.680 --> 0:46:28.080
Programmer who's looking to get you know, a new programmer who's looking to make a career in programming or learn programming learn. Jason

634
0:46:28.560 --> 0:46:36.480
Jason is is amazing and used pretty much like everywhere. So learn. Jason if you don't know. Jason learn. Jason. So, uh, here is a

635
0:46:38.220 --> 0:46:40.220
Particular

636
0:46:40.220 --> 0:46:46.540
Anim j file. So if you're not looking at it and in the the notes here i'll try and get a link to it in the notes on on sounder etc.

637
0:46:46.540 --> 0:46:48.860
This anim j file, um will

638
0:46:49.420 --> 0:46:52.780
Change the position of a slot at various times

639
0:46:53.500 --> 0:47:00.460
And so you'll see that there is a list of keyframes and so it will then animate between those keyframes to those values

640
0:47:00.860 --> 0:47:04.620
And that's really all there is to anim j but you can do so many complicated things to it

641
0:47:04.620 --> 0:47:11.020
Um, so if you look at that file, you'll see at time index zero the key the the the left cube is at zero zero zero

642
0:47:11.180 --> 0:47:16.380
If you look at time one, I've moved the cube or whatever to not point two to the left

643
0:47:16.700 --> 0:47:21.420
Why are there so many red lines here expected comma? Did I make an error problem with my

644
0:47:21.980 --> 0:47:29.100
My jason's fine value expected very confused. That's valid. Jason, but it's saying it's not unless i'm just missing something. Anyway, um,

645
0:47:29.100 --> 0:47:36.540
um, so you put that stuff into an animator component and then you hook it up to various properties and then you're able to

646
0:47:36.940 --> 0:47:38.940
Animate it. Um

647
0:47:38.940 --> 0:47:45.100
It's it's basically a way of describing translations. Um, it's it's it's if you look at that that that script above

648
0:47:45.260 --> 0:47:48.460
I put in the screenshot of and you don't see what's happening

649
0:47:48.940 --> 0:47:51.520
Um, then you'll have to wait for the tutorial unfortunately

650
0:47:52.220 --> 0:47:55.660
Moving, uh up because there are questions I missed. Um,

651
0:47:55.660 --> 0:47:59.980
I also keep a hard limit of this at five or as we've gone over by half an hour, but we'll

652
0:48:00.460 --> 0:48:03.260
Stop at five. So we've got six more minutes questions. Uh, so

653
0:48:03.900 --> 0:48:05.340
second

654
0:48:05.340 --> 0:48:10.540
Asks do shared items i.e given to you in a public folder take up storage of safety in your own world. I

655
0:48:11.420 --> 0:48:14.620
Don't know. I think I have an answer there, but I don't want to be proven wrong

656
0:48:14.620 --> 0:48:16.700
I know storage space is a hot topic right now. So

657
0:48:17.420 --> 0:48:21.100
Try it if you save a public folder in your inventory. No

658
0:48:21.100 --> 0:48:26.460
No, but if you save it in your own world and save that world, there is a reference to that item

659
0:48:26.780 --> 0:48:31.820
But it should deduplicate the assets on that item, but there still is a storage cost for saving that item in the world

660
0:48:31.900 --> 0:48:33.900
So, I don't know

661
0:48:34.300 --> 0:48:40.140
Pushka says can you choose to save reference to object individually and saving instead of saving entire object to the cloud?

662
0:48:40.300 --> 0:48:45.980
No, although we'll sometimes do that for you. You just don't know that we're doing it. Easton shows an example of

663
0:48:46.940 --> 0:48:49.740
Adding numbers together again, that's perfect. Uh

664
0:48:49.740 --> 0:48:53.260
Olin says instructions unclear and then shows the adder node

665
0:48:53.340 --> 0:48:59.260
So the adder node I can't remember which folder the adder node is in but we actually have what's called a binary adder in

666
0:48:59.500 --> 0:49:03.820
um in logics, um, I learned that back at university but like, uh

667
0:49:04.380 --> 0:49:08.220
adding together two numbers in binary is like

668
0:49:08.780 --> 0:49:15.980
Magic and that's because it's binary and so adding them together is very very complicated moving forwards Easton says it's possible to make an anim

669
0:49:15.980 --> 0:49:21.340
J animator tool inside a Neos probably not but possibly yes, but also no

670
0:49:21.820 --> 0:49:24.540
Um, the reason behind that is you'll need to construct a json file

671
0:49:24.540 --> 0:49:28.220
Which is technically possible with a lot of string matching and string nodes, etc

672
0:49:28.380 --> 0:49:29.980
But once you've got that json file

673
0:49:29.980 --> 0:49:35.660
You then need to create a file from that save that file to somewhere which is not inside Neos and then re-import it

674
0:49:35.900 --> 0:49:41.340
Like you have to re-import it into Neos as an anim. J file for Neos to kick in and be like, ah

675
0:49:41.340 --> 0:49:43.820
It's an animation. I'll do the anim j processing on it great

676
0:49:43.820 --> 0:49:46.940
Uh double six is what is an mjs and uses animation library?

677
0:49:46.940 --> 0:49:55.260
No, it's a way of representing animations that are compatible with Neos's animation library as json outside of Neos

678
0:49:55.660 --> 0:49:59.820
Uh codices so basically deconstructing a dope sheet into json and bring it into Neos. Yes

679
0:50:00.360 --> 0:50:02.360
Absolutely. Um

680
0:50:02.620 --> 0:50:04.140
Uh

681
0:50:04.140 --> 0:50:08.220
Vrc refugee ghoul or the ghoul. Okay. There we go. Your name is confusing

682
0:50:08.220 --> 0:50:12.220
Sorry, uh the ghoul is there a way to fix the little shelves on my wrist? Those are tool anchors

683
0:50:12.220 --> 0:50:16.300
Those are the tool shelf anchors, um scroll up in this chat a little bit

684
0:50:16.300 --> 0:50:22.220
You'll see the tool shelf or tool anchor tutorial that shows you how to uh move them around and play with them

685
0:50:22.300 --> 0:50:24.940
If you don't want them there, you can also turn them off that way as well

686
0:50:24.940 --> 0:50:28.700
But just I think turning off the anchor will do it. Um, they are great though

687
0:50:28.700 --> 0:50:33.660
Maybe I should do a tool shelf tutorial because people don't understand them and then they struggle to equip tools and i'm just like

688
0:50:34.220 --> 0:50:38.940
Look how fast I can equip tools using my tool shelf and then people are like, oh, that's what those are for

689
0:50:38.940 --> 0:50:42.700
And i'm like, yep, that's what those are for math binary for the adder. Thank you

690
0:50:42.860 --> 0:50:46.700
The adder is is really cool. Zach asks an interesting question about how does um,

691
0:50:47.340 --> 0:50:50.060
Lex's anim j that he shared compared to

692
0:50:50.620 --> 0:50:56.860
Changing it using logics. You could also change it using logics, but sometimes um, it might be better to use uh,

693
0:50:57.180 --> 0:51:01.660
Anim j if you know how to do it. Um, it just depends on what you'd like to do. So

694
0:51:02.300 --> 0:51:03.260
um

695
0:51:03.260 --> 0:51:04.700
in anim j

696
0:51:04.700 --> 0:51:06.460
Lex has the ability to

697
0:51:06.460 --> 0:51:09.020
Do things in a little bit more of a structured way

698
0:51:09.420 --> 0:51:12.960
Where there's the way that would that would happen in logics is is maybe more complicated

699
0:51:13.580 --> 0:51:18.060
Um in some cases what you're doing in logics for animations is writing mathematical equations

700
0:51:18.060 --> 0:51:22.300
Which result in the animation that you want and for anyone that just got scared by that

701
0:51:22.780 --> 0:51:26.860
Don't worry about that. I know that was a scary sentence. It's honestly not that bad

702
0:51:27.180 --> 0:51:32.720
There is a video I have about uh reciprocal motion which uses maths to make an animation

703
0:51:32.720 --> 0:51:38.560
And it is quite easy. Once you get the hang of it, which i'll paste here. We are at 16 59

704
0:51:38.560 --> 0:51:41.760
So specs dorky if you have a question go for it. Otherwise, no more questions

705
0:51:42.460 --> 0:51:48.260
Immediately dorky stops typing. I'm sorry dorky. Is there a difference between the term as oscillating and reciprocating?

706
0:51:49.120 --> 0:51:55.520
Like is that difference? I don't know probably that's a good way of phrasing it spec says animating via logics procedural

707
0:51:55.520 --> 0:52:01.440
You're calculating animation in real time animating via anim j is baked. The animation is a preset of known values. Yep. That's great

708
0:52:01.440 --> 0:52:07.280
It is now 1700 canadian gets you better finish your typed message quickly, or I will send you an angry cat gift

709
0:52:07.360 --> 0:52:09.360
Okay, well cut it there

710
0:52:09.360 --> 0:52:10.400
If you have any further questions

711
0:52:10.400 --> 0:52:15.520
Please drop them in the questions and help section of the uh, neos discord direct message me find me in game

712
0:52:15.840 --> 0:52:21.680
Send me a homing pigeon hopefully with a cheese reward, but uh, I will see you guys around. Bye. Bye

713
0:52:21.680 --> 0:52:31.620
It sounded vaguely mickey mousy. I'm not going to do a mickey mouse impression, but there you go. Bye. Bye
