1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
 So welcome to office hours, it's 4 p.m. We'll get started. If you have any questions, please drop them in the office hours text chat thread

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,080
 I will just @tag office hours again, let them know that we're starting and then we'll see if there's any questions

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080
 I can't there are can't be that

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,260
 There aren't any currently, but we'll see what happens once I @tag

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,320
 That's @tag

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,960
 Prime time that's fine. We've only got like six people here. Come on guys. Tell your friends. It's it's prime time

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
 We're gonna talk about cheese. Um, I

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,920
 I'm just gonna wait for people to join. I think we'll give them a few minutes simply because you know

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,240
 All the people here are like people that are aware of

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,080
 What I was gonna say to start with whilst I was waiting for questions, which is like hey check the announcements channel

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
 We have another build. Yeah

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,880
 But cool does anyone

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:58,120
 Does anyone else get really bothered by socks? Not the user like actual socks, right? So my legs just don't don't like socks

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,320
 I don't know if I'm like buying the wrong socks or something. But like

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,000
 Hank was always itchy if I wear socks and sometimes like I'll put them on because I'm leaving the house and I'll forget to take

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,400
 Them off. Yeah, it's like irritation. But it's also like I don't know. It feels like the socks are like clamping my legs too much

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,640
 Anyway, guess we're talking about socks for a bit. There are no questions if you type in the question, we'll stop talking about socks

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,000
 I promise. Oh, we have a natural question. Hell yeah, we can stop talking about socks

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,780
 Although it is a quick question. Yes, the mentor program is open. You can find out more information about it on the wiki

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,960
 I'm preparing the link for you right now. We can find out everything that you'd like to know about that

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:43,180
 So weird like page break that shouldn't be there in in the wiki there. Let me see if I can get rid of that

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,860
 It's logged me out. Great. I'll have to go to the login page

23
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,760
 So wiki text which is

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,780
 Similar to I guess like other forms of mark mark up etc. It's a little bit like mark down in the

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,260
 It is what's called white space sensitive. So in some cases we just see like random line breaks that shouldn't be there

26
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,440
 There we go. I fixed it

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,680
 So yeah, if you're editing the wiki

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:20,700
 Make sure that you add random line breaks in various places. Right moving forwards to actual questions

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
 So Lou says

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,780
 Maybe not need specific, but what's heavier on an on a per item basis material orbs or material slots?

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,940
 So they're technically the same thing, right? So a

32
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,820
 Material orb in Neos just refers back to the material that exists inside memory

33
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,340
 This actually occurs a lot more in Neos than you realize

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,700
 So in a lot of cases what we do is we create a 3d representation of an object to help you out

35
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,580
 Another example might be like a sound file or in some cases a picture as well

36
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,500
 That isn't the actual picture, but it's a reference to the picture within memory

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,900
 And then you can sort of you know

38
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,420
 Drag it around put it inside all the boxes and stuff that you need to make it work

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,060
 So that's all a material orb is but a material orb

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,960
 represents a material that is in memory and it will stay in memory in the world if it's being used and isn't cleaned up with

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
 the the various cleanup options that we have

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,820
 So then it goes on to your answer about slots versus orbs so by material slots

43
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,580
 I think you're probably referring to the number of materials and mesh has in the mesh renderer component within the inspector now

44
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,100
 I don't quite know how rendering is handled

45
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,900
 But let's say you have an object that has two material slots and in each of those materials slots

46
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,900
 There is a completely different material

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,500
 What that means is in the rendering logic of whatever shade you're using and the engine itself, etc

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,920
 It has to do two calculations for that object rather than one

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,660
 I'm not it's thousands of calculations because you know light and the shit like that

50
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,340
 But like we know I mean, it's like two sets of calculations

51
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,020
 once for let's say the red material once for let's say the blue material and so that will

52
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,400
 double the

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,660
 Sets of calculations that will do it depending on what type of material means the number of calculations, right?

54
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,100
 So there'll be two of them rather than one of them. So of course, that's that's worse in terms of performance

55
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,740
 I don't know what happens if you put the same material in

56
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,260
 in both slots

57
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,280
 Let's say you know

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,660
 like a door where the door frame is one material and the door itself is another material like a

59
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,280
 White door frame with like a wood colored door because you haven't painted it or whatever

60
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,740
 If that was two materials and then suddenly like well what if I did paint the door white, right?

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,000
 So then you put the white wood material in the in the wood material door slot

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,300
 I don't know what that would do to the draw calls because it still is technically two separate

63
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,760
 What's called like sub missions within the within the mesh?

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:54,020
 Yeah, they're also so spec says it would still incur a call

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,620
 I think that's the way it works as well because it's still there like it's still a separate

66
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,760
 Unit of work, I guess would be the term there is a button that says combine

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,580
 Slots of the same materials as a button there that will do that

68
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,980
 So Lou has expanded on their question by asking

69
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,820
 Mostly wondering because VRC's performance stats only count slots

70
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,280
 So having three slots of materials counts the same as having three slots and nine materials

71
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,040
 I would have to like go take a look at VR chats like calculation to figure that one out. I don't know

72
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,780
 What they're doing compared to what we're doing. All I know is that

73
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,720
 VRChat with like high safety settings and high performance

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,580
 Is not a fun place to be I was in a few worlds at the end of last week and

75
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,580
 It's crazy. It's like guys

76
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:47,160
 90% of the avatars in this world have been turned off because they were not like very poor

77
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,260
 They're poor right and they've been turned up like it's just crazy

78
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,700
 Atlitius stuff bake your blend shapes

79
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,500
 Atlitius textures, you know, okay. Let's move over to the next question here from rampur

80
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,260
 There is some giggles because I've answered this question like three or four times but it always comes up when a new device appears so

81
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,540
 rampur

82
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,500
 Alex via rampur via like basically the entire community wants to know will Neos come on to pick Pico Neo

83
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,200
 If you want Neos supported on a device

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,420
 Make github issue for that device and then all updates about that device will be on that issue

85
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,780
 so there is an issue already for the quest pro there's one I think for the

86
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:38,780
 Five I forget what it's called like not the like sunglasses one where you look like that guy from that film. I don't remember

87
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,780
 But the one where it's actually a headset that's got an issue

88
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,240
 I think the vajra has got an issue

89
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,020
 Like basically if you want a device supported make a github issue and then the gap issue will help you

90
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,840
 Sort of collate stuff

91
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,620
 The other thing it does of course is it means that if you're unsure or you don't know anything

92
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,380
 There's any updates in that you can just go to that issue. It's a little bit like, you know

93
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,720
 The whole check announcements thing but for devices specifically what it means is that we are

94
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,940
 Standardizing what we're saying about various devices by making sure that there is an issue there which we can then update

95
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,680
 So if you are wanting that device supported you can subscribe to that issue

96
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,060
 Make sure you get email notifications on if that issue is resolved

97
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,700
 Generically speaking, of course would like to be on every device

98
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,540
 But there's various reasons why that's not possible

99
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,180
 If you do make an issue make sure you get people that have that device or want to see that device supported to thumbs up

100
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,940
 And that will allow you to show support, you know as an example

101
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:40,620
 Let's say where we have budget in our development roadmap for one additional device to be supported and we see that one headset has

102
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,140
 100 thumbs up and one headset has one thumbs up

103
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,900
 You can probably guess what the conversation would be there

104
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,400
 Of course, we could overwrite that depending on technical specifics the complexity difficulty etc

105
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,040
 But hey a hundred people the community want this headset and one person wants this headset. It's kind of like, you know

106
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,720
 The other thing to remind people as well

107
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,400
 Is that like if you message any team member about any objective that you want them to achieve?

108
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,220
 They'll probably forget it. They don't intend to they're just like busy

109
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,260
 So it's very important that you make sure that it is locked somewhere

110
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,560
 I log everything that people talk to me about because I know that they're lazy and that they won't make issues

111
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,140
 But we're all human we're gonna forget the best way to ensure that your answer is question

112
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,840
 Sorry, the feature is answered is to put in a geometry moving forwards

113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,180
 Jackal says does the renderer prioritize based on what order the materials thoughts are in

114
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,080
 No, that would be based on the render queue setting

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,000
 Or is it render offset saying it's the one that's always negative one like that determines what's going on there

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,960
 So if it's negative one, it basically means like hey use your own best judgment and it will it'll slot in based on its attributes

117
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,600
 If you set a number there

118
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,180
 Then it will make sure that it is rendered there at a particular number set if that doesn't make sense

119
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,620
 I want you to think about transparency. So let's say that you had a

120
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,440
 let's just say like a

121
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,540
 Glass box, right?

122
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,120
 and so the the front of the box has got a piece of glass on it with a glass material and then the back of

123
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,680
 The box of the inside of the box is like I don't know that like plush velvet stuff. You see jewelry put in if

124
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,060
 it were to render the

125
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,240
 Transparent glass first it wouldn't know what's behind the glass. So it wouldn't be able to be like, oh, but what's behind the glass?

126
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,280
 So it usually will render the inside first and then the glass second because the glass has transparency it gets rendered

127
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,280
 After everything else in front of it or behind it

128
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,320
 Sharky and ask a question which says is there any

129
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,120
 Expressions built in some of the public avis are missing something lots of the public avatars will have expressions and gestures built into them

130
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,940
 I wouldn't know specifically unless you had one in mind and if you did have one in mind

131
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,500
 It's probably community made at which point it's like go ask the community member that made it

132
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,440
 We do have official avatars, of course in Neos Essentials

133
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,640
 They are just sort of

134
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,220
 Collections of avatars that we have the appropriate licenses to have in Neos Essentials some of those have gestures some of them don't again

135
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,960
 It's not something I can answer sort of

136
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,900
 Globally in a global level I can only answer it locally

137
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:19,220
 Okay, we go so Jackal asks, I know that we shouldn't use local timer local use of the timer node

138
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,360
 But could you direct local user?

139
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,560
 Info into timer by the way of a button and have the timer node just applied to just the user press the button and all

140
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,000
 for the local system

141
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,680
 Do that with a variable

142
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,540
 So on button push write local user to a variable like whatever type of variable you want and then pass that into time

143
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,200
 I do that all the time

144
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
 funny pun

145
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,280
 I have lots of things that need to sort of have a

146
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,120
 particular user involved and

147
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,940
 You know, they need to what's the word I'm trying to look for? I'm lost on English for a second

148
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:01,340
 when running scientific experiments data gathering or even sometimes games or experiences or even sometimes like just an

149
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:09,040
 Object you want to make sure that the user that is running the timer node the updates the rights the web requests, etc

150
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,360
 Is a specific user so I'm often making gadgets tools worlds, etc

151
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,880
 Where there is a dynamic variable that is used every single time you need a user. It's just like world

152
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,760
 The user world the user that matters world boss person

153
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,600
 You know and then that way everything runs based on them

154
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,000
 Nitra says our new github issues actually being looked at by linear's team. Basically, none of them are getting official responses

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I look at every single issue

156
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,400
 Yeah, I look every single issue because it's cool

157
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,440
 It's like it's it's bad when you like say it's not bad bad wrong word

158
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,220
 It's like it's confusing when people say that they don't have official responses because it's like the official responses

159
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,280
 We can give to an issue are we are going to work on this. We are working on this

160
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,800
 We are not going to work on this. We have done this all questions, right?

161
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,780
 And so because of the current situation see the announcements channel blah blah blah. I don't talk about it

162
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,240
 It's difficult to respond to any of those they get looked at though

163
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,760
 But beyond that even if they were not looked at it's better that they're written down

164
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,000
 Because the team will forget if they're not written down

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,960
 So it's not like it's not the best case scenario, of course, you know

166
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,120
 It gets implemented immediately when you have an issue, but it's better than your issue being forgotten

167
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
 So it's the better of of like two evils is the wrong word

168
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,160
 But it's the better occurrence compared to it being forgotten. It is better to put it in an issue. I need to vacuum anyway, um

169
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,240
 Shrikey says the valleys are the main ones I use and here's some PLC and some tablet computers. I'm sure they are licensed

170
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,560
 Um, I can't keep up with the valley community. There are so many different bases models

171
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,120
 adjustments

172
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,160
 Kit bashes rips copy pasters politics and drama etc

173
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,400
 I'm not like I said, I'm not up-to-date on this but at one point

174
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,820
 I think that there was a creator annoyed because another creator had made a novalli base and was releasing it for free and it was

175
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,780
 better than the one that was paid previously or something and it's just like

176
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:19,960
 the only thing that can be charged for money in the sort of world of avatar creation is

177
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,760
 uniqueness or

178
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,160
 Like customized work so talking like test textures clothing, etc

179
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,280
 If someone comes along and makes like a very similar, but of course not identical

180
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:39,160
 Inspired version of that character then I don't think you have license to it. The only exception there would be if the

181
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,320
 Licensing to the original character the original of Ali was locked down which I believe at one point it was

182
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,640
 But then you can sort of say like well, it's not an avali

183
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,680
 It's like this other space bird and if you don't agree with that

184
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,680
 I just want you to look at every single video game has a pig in it and wonder if a furry had decided that the pig

185
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,920
 Avatar base was theirs and no one else could use a pig then

186
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,760
 Minecraft would be on the hook any other video game that has a pig would be on the hook because you know

187
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,080
 It's it's a pig

188
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,840
 You want a simpler version of that if I tell you to imagine an apple and you imagine a nice apple in your head

189
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,520
 The original like owner of the Apple doesn't isn't doesn't own that right?

190
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
 You can't it's just weird

191
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,560
 anyway

192
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,080
 Not legal advice. Please seek legal advice in a jurisdiction of your choosing

193
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,960
 but if you would like to

194
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:40,120
 Figure out which of the avali bases you can use or has gestures or something like that

195
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,100
 I would encourage you to ask a mentor the mentors have a bunch of resources which will

196
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:52,240
 They're basically sort of various avatars that are set up have the appropriate licenses to be shared and some of them might have

197
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,420
 Gestures or etc so Lord buckethead asks when can you see new six manning popularity only once our current issues are fixed?

198
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,620
 Yeah, moving forwards to

199
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,280
 Jackals question. What is your next tutorial going to be about well? I don't know

200
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,400
 I'm a bit busy with life right now

201
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,000
 I need to get a new employment set up, and I'm also changing apartments funny thing about this right so

202
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,120
 I live on a big apartment communities. That's like really expensive and

203
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
 If I move like it's literally the building next door

204
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,060
 It's like a grand cheaper and pretty much the same thing

205
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,180
 I don't know what's happening with this like area

206
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,500
 I live in but like it might be where I like I ring up a mover and I go like hey

207
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,980
 Hey, hey guys. I need a you know a one-bed apartment move. They're like oh how far you go number three steps

208
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,580
 They're just like what?

209
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,920
 You might as well not bring like a truck you might as well

210
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,380
 Just like bring some dollies and help me like the couch would probably be the couch of the bed would probably be the most awkward ones

211
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,600
 To move everything else is just gonna be like put it in a box put it on a dolly

212
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,660
 We'll it three steps out the back door and into the front door of the other place. Let's go

213
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,500
 but yeah, that will save like a grander month, which is

214
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,220
 Anyway um

215
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:19,020
 Hence why that'll probably be my next tutorial is how to how to contact a moving company and explain that you want to move

216
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,980
 two meters to the left

217
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:29,040
 Moving on to Rob's question Rob who says does need to support custom mesh to form as a bend to form for example

218
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,620
 I'd like to create a machine learning to form with the estimates custom character deformations for a different 3d package

219
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,940
 No, we don't support any of that you might be able to add something like that with a plugin

220
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
 But we don't support any of that currently

221
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,580
 Yes, that is true. I mean like the plugin page

222
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,860
 So ramp was saying that plugins will prevent you from connecting to sessions where users do not have that plugin

223
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,900
 That is correct here is the plugins page

224
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,460
 Rob also are saying ideas for implementing chat GPT agents into the world you need to use the HD

225
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:13,380
 Sorry you need to use the HTTP nodes to get that sort of probably you probably also like to do something over web sockets because

226
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,380
 It is chat, but I would probably

227
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,940
 suggest

228
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,940
 HTTP instead

229
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:25,060
 Many people have done that you'd have to look around in the community. I'm sure someone can help you out. I haven't done it

230
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,060
 I actually don't recommend it either

231
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,460
 Not because it isn't cool or isn't applications for it. I just like

232
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:39,700
 Personal take on chat GPT is completely overboard overblown and out of proportion it guesses the next letter or word in a sentence

233
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,980
 That's it

234
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,660
 so

235
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
 It isn't accurate basically

236
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:52,020
 It'll look like it is but then it isn't so it's crazy like that people are relying on it to write code and things like that

237
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,660
 I just always feel that's weird like how much detail you're looking at and making sure that this is like the most optimal code or

238
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,060
 The best secure code. I don't know anyway moving onwards to Risa's question

239
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,300
 But doing a lot of baked blender animations, and I keep finding myself something in a strange rotation issue

240
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,820
 That's new to appear in Neos but not in blender

241
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,860
 I really don't know what the cause is but my something to do with interpolated quarter

242
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:18,180
 Quaternion rotation I can't show any pointers on baking imported baked machines only in my correct having them animate correctly I

243
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:24,760
 Don't know and now the reason I don't know is because periodically we will find a a quaternarian

244
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,940
 Problem so there was this mop

245
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,380
 Many years ago. He was like a year or so ago

246
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,840
 There was a mop which I try to import from sketchfab and the mop would just look wrong

247
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,120
 It was just wrong like like bits were rotated weirdly

248
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,500
 That got fixed and then earth mark was using an avatar where I can't reverse the left or right leg

249
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,940
 But one of their legs was just sort of like rotated in such a way that it just didn't make any sense

250
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,500
 And so now there's actually a test in

251
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,860
 Our like test code for mathematics which is annotated as the flamingo leg test

252
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,300
 And it's designed to sort of make sure that that leg problem never reoccurs I

253
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,900
 Don't know about looking into into what's going on there. I haven't had that experience

254
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,940
 We have baked animations that I've been doing, but I've only really been doing

255
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:20,080
 Like character based animations from XMO and stuff like that so that might be why because I don't know like characters are like a known

256
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,800
 Good path compared to maybe like you know other more complex animations like this is like mechanical stuff

257
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 I don't know. He always I know

258
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,580
 Could always make a good issue

259
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,820
 With you know a log file and a sample blender that we can take a look at

260
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:42,780
 Shaky says what is the Neos coin going to be back in my builds and it came back at suspended, okay?

261
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,740
 It is in live builds. It is in the standalone light bill. It cannot be in the steam build

262
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,820
 It is not allowed to be in the steam build by steam if the Neos coin was in the steam build

263
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,540
 Then we wouldn't have a steam build so there's your answer to that if you only use the Neos coin

264
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,860
 You can use the standalone it's all the questions. I have on the list so

265
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,460
 Any additional questions, please get them through always will be ending off in about three minutes or three minutes

266
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:13,180
 Any additional questions? I always apologize like at some point like I know I'm basically saying like make stuff on the github a lot

267
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:18,380
 But truly I will forget these questions at some point or if on the github

268
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,620
 There's a lesser chance that I will forget. That's a good chatty question. Thanks Lord buckethead

269
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,780
 So buckethead asks do you have any personal favorite worlds in Neos?

270
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:33,180
 I like worlds which are break the norm and the reason why I say break the norm is we have a metaverse engine but

271
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:40,140
 predominantly the largest category of worlds I see are social worlds followed by a game worlds and

272
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,900
 While social worlds are great. There's only so many like cushions string lights

273
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,420
 Soft lighting and mirrors that I can take before they all start looking the same for example over in in VR chat

274
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,380
 There's I don't know like 500 or so

275
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,860
 Club worlds there's the black cat which I can see here

276
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,100
 They're the black cats sort of a more upmarket pub compared to the great pug

277
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:12,860
 But functionally the great pug and the black cat are the same and then there's like cozy rooftop something something

278
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:19,540
 There's about five of those are all named cozy rooftop something something the pattern there is just tons of cushions and string lights

279
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,700
 So I get kind of like worn out on social worlds what I like in terms of worlds is anything

280
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,580
 That is not a social world and in some cases in a game, but

281
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,100
 What I mean in terms of games go to the game was I want something which is an experience

282
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,580
 I see a lot of games where it feels a bit like an arcade machine, right you play the game

283
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,580
 As though you're playing an arcade machine, but like we're in virtual reality

284
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:50,040
 So I'd like to see game worlds where I feel like I am in that world like a higher sense of immersion or something like that

285
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,380
 example might be the MMC folks who made the

286
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,060
 Transfer and the one where you swapped bodies. I'm sorry. I don't remember the name

287
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:06,780
 Transference transistence something like that that was transpose there we go. I knew it was trans something that was like an experience

288
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,860
 That was an experience right which sort of like it went beyond the sort of

289
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,380
 What I mean by arcade is let's think like murder for example

290
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,120
 Murder is a round based game and when you get to the end of the round everything resets

291
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,640
 And if you think of it like an arcade all right put another quarter in that machine whereas

292
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,940
 Transpose it's like hey

293
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,660
 This is a whole experience when you get to the end of that experience your life is

294
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,340
 Better is the wrong word your life has been enriched by that experience

295
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,020
 That comes from mostly my might my love of what I call like exploration based puzzle games

296
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,100
 When I say I like puzzle games to people they're like oh like Sudoku, and I'm like I mean yeah

297
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,640
 I could do Sudoku every now and again

298
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,040
 But that's not what I mean what I mean is like the puzzle isn't Morse code

299
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,060
 a

300
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
 five-digit pin code on a door

301
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,740
 I

302
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,340
 Read blue or green involved please don't use colors in your puzzle maps

303
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,220
 But it's like not only are you solving the puzzle of the puzzle that you're facing

304
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,660
 But you're also solving the puzzle of the world like what is this world was this world want me to feel

305
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,820
 What is this world want me to experience so you can look at games such as?

306
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,220
 The mysteries for that

307
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,020
 Quern is another good example

308
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,760
 Duction as well, I'm just listening science at this point

309
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,500
 If your game was made by cyan yes

310
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,780
 No, there's a steam curator. I like when it comes to games

311
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,140
 I know I've like drifted away from the actual topic which was you know worlds inside news, but like think about making an experience

312
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,780
 Over making a place for an experience to occur in so social worlds

313
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,700
 They're made for an experience to occur and that experience might be hanging out with friends and having a good time

314
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:53,660
 Perfectly fine perfectly suitable. There's nothing wrong with them, but what I want to see is VR world that gives me an experience

315
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,120
 By itself if that made any sense thumbs up. I'll now check other questions

316
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,500
 Speaking of cyan their next game comes out in

317
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,320
 About five days ish five six days. I'll be gone. I'll be playing that

318
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,600
 Of course I'll still be doing any work. I need to be doing but

319
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,060
 We've like that. It's it's it's a big. They would be amazing. I think it's got PR. I'm not sure I can't remember

320
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:25,020
 Yeah, I've been waiting on that forever to the point where I forgot it existed and the something like it's releasing next week like okay

321
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,220
 No need to yell moving on to a question which we have from Lou

322
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:36,540
 They say is there a different reason KFC which from my listening is a useless currency without a real-world value is blocked on steam bills

323
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,780
 It's just because it's built on the same part as in CR

324
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,200
 KFC is what we call a canary so if you're not familiar with the terminology of canary

325
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,760
 miners used to take canaries which are just small birds down into the coal mines with them and

326
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,960
 The canary would die in a response to any sort of toxic gas before the miners would

327
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,460
 This is before we had some things like gas detectors or health meters or even oxygen tanks or stuff like this

328
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,520
 So they know if the canary died they should get out of the coal mine because it was dangerous

329
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,760
 And they did that's to come forwards into the sort of software design world as if you want a canary

330
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:17,740
 It's if the canary broke something is very very broken. So KFC is a canary for NCR. So

331
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,020
 Its entire existence is just to test NCR related functionality

332
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:28,540
 And so it is pretty much like a copy/paste of it's not a copy/paste if you think you know technology or programming

333
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,020
 Well, you know, it's not a copy/paste its configuration and stuff like that. But for the layman's terms

334
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,060
 It's a copy/paste of the NCR code. And so we have code which says if we are a steam belt

335
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,700
 Disable NCR, but it's not disabled NCR. It's disabled any type of token

336
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,620
 And so it just naturally kills KFC as well

337
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,660
 And if it didn't kill KFC then KFC as a canary wouldn't work as a canary

338
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,560
 So that's the reason why it's it's sort of linked. That was a long

339
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,540
 Wibbly-wobbly explanation I apologize beyond that

340
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,220
 It would be easy for KFC to be mistaken

341
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:13,900
 So, you know a steam store review person for the policy could look at KFC and mistake it for NCR quite easily

342
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,180
 And you know just how serious it was they were like, nope, we're taking you off steam. You've got crypto in you

343
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,920
 We're taking you off steam. That's like how hard and fast they were about it

344
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,860
 So we didn't want to give them any reason to say you still have crypto

345
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,940
 Even though we don't in the steam boat, of course. Yeah, KFC is just testing right?

346
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,900
 It's the exact same code the exact same flow the exact same UI. It's just got no real-world value

347
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,420
 People have given it value

348
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,900
 There's like casinos that use it. There's experiences that use it, etc. It's just testing with that

349
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,700
 I believe we're gonna leave off as we're at 35 past

350
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:57,060
 So let's go ahead and close off things and I will speak to you next week. I am very far behind on notes

351
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,380
 I was having some issues with whisper which is our

352
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,860
 thing that

353
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,260
 transcribes them based on stuff which

354
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,740
 Lexivr built so thank you much to them for their services and building the tooling

355
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,700
 But sometimes it just I'll leave it running for like three hours and I'll tab back and it's broken

356
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:23,180
 That's not Lex's fault. That's just whisper crashing or something. I've got to look into it. I have just finished

357
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,500
 I just looked last week's was just transcribed in text

358
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,580
 So that'll go up along with the one before the vacation I had and then I'll get this one transcribed me as soon as I can

359
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,940
 I'll post here when I've got them up to date. I know it's a problem

360
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,100
 I know I keep falling behind but I'll do my best and I will speak to you again soon
