1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
 Welcome to Office Hours, it is 4pm so I'll go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,680
 This is a half hour to hour segment, depends how much I waffle about cheese, where I answer

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,040
 your questions about Neos.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,880
 If you want to ask a question, please drop it in the Office Hours text chat, that's

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,640
 a couple of channels above this one.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,840
 We've been absent for a couple of weeks, I was on vacation, and by vacation I mean

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,680
 I stay at home and people come and stay with me, and then we do vacationy things.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,280
 It's like, cool, I actually visited the town I live in.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
 Excellent.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,560
 Anyway, moving on with Office Hours, let's go ahead and get those questions that are

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,720
 waiting, read and answered before I go off on a random tangent about life.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,640
 So Tiki asks, "Joining my headless of hundreds of megabytes of project pictures taken so

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:49,760
 long to load, it often times out and just stops loading any further from new users.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,360
 I tried moving to 2 gigabit internet connection, and with 8 new users loading, it doesn't

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,800
 even approach 1 gigabit throughput.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
 Is there any optimization I'm missing?"

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,180
 That's probably the asset variance system trying to help you out there, and me being

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,620
 a bit slow I'm not entirely certain.

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,320
 I'd have to look into the world itself and some of the late loading stuff there.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,280
 There are a bunch of issues open on GitHub for assets loading slowly and gather jobs

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
 getting stuck.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,560
 Both of those issues boggle my mind and drive me completely mad, they affect friends of

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,440
 mine, and all sorts of things make me not fun to play.

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,360
 So we'll look into that under those two issues.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:41,560
 As for optimizations, don't have hundreds of megabytes of project pictures in your world.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,560
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know that's weird, but that is one of the ways to prevent that

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,400
 from being a problem.

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,680
 Moving onwards, Tiki has a second question which says "On the same chain of thought,

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,380
 is there any reason why exporting a picture disk takes multiple seconds instead of maybe

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,400
 a second or less than I'd expect for a megabyte?"

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,880
 I have noticed import taking a long time, particularly like normal maps, sometimes they'll

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,840
 import a normal map and it'll take like a minute to show up.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
 I haven't noticed export taking a long time.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,300
 I have with like a complex mesh, but I'm talking like millions of triangles so I kind of just

35
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,360
 give it like a free pass and hope it doesn't crash when I'm exporting a mesh like that.

36
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,080
 Make sure there's a GitHub issue launched for that, and I'll take a look at it when

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,000
 I can get to it.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,600
 Lex asks "Any updates on making the native build of Neo's work again?"

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,200
 There are no updates on that front.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,280
 Please continue to read announcements, and be patient on that one.

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,840
 Next is Unnamed Cyborg Cat says "Is text-based programming a feature yet?"

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,920
 It is not a feature yet, it's a feature request you can take a look at.

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,920
 I think there's a couple of GitHub issues for it, but take a look at those, thumbs them

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,960
 up, and we'll get to them when we are able to.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,440
 For the past, I don't know, like four or five questions, it might have seemed like those

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,160
 are sort of hand-wavy answers.

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,320
 Do remember the "I can't live debug" because I can't live debug with you guys, it's not

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,720
 something I'm capable of doing whilst I'm on air, so to speak, in inverted commas.

49
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,000
 So do you guys call it like inverted commas or quote marks?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,680
 Back in the UK we call them inverted commas, because that's what they are, they're two

51
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,240
 sets of inverted commas, they're like upside down commas, but whatever, quote marks.

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,280
 Anyway, so make sure there are GitHub issues open for them, and we'll look at them when

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
 we can.

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,160
 I get it's a problem, I just sometimes can't just dive into code.

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,520
 I do have it open, so sometimes I'll dive in to answer a question, but if it's a bug

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,520
 that's going to take me longer than a few minutes to look at, it's just not suitable

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,240
 for this particular environment.

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:52,120
 M3-opera-e-m-machine3, I wondered if you were the person who made the machine3 blender add-on,

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,680
 but probably not.

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,480
 Maybe, of course though.

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,800
 Is it possible to use Neos for business applications like an art gallery?

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,960
 Yeah, you could totally do that.

63
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,760
 Do remember that for certain business applications you may need Neos Pro, the best way is to

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,120
 read the Neos Pro wiki page to understand what that is, and before purchasing Neos Pro,

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,680
 email hello@neos.com with your request for Neos Pro and see if they get back to you about

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,720
 their use.

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,060
 Art gallery, as an example, would not require Neos Pro, and actually would be quite nice

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,680
 to see, you probably have to have like lockdown permissions, and therefore not many people

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,440
 would visit it from our community, they would want to have permissions in there, but if

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,600
 you had an audience they would be able to visit it quite fine there.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,120
 Headless server, as Linker says, can handle quite a bit based on performance.

72
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,560
 I usually like to say 20 or so is where you start seeing issues, people go up to 30, but

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
 then issues really start to appear.

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,280
 It also depends on if you're having a full iCade avatar or just a head and hands avatar.

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,320
 I know that number is quite low, you can push it depending on the specifics without knowing

76
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,680
 where you're hosting your headless or what specs of the headless machine you're having.

77
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,120
 20 is the number I would start with, and then I would experiment at going higher than 20.

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,400
 So we have a follow up question from m3rpmmachine who says "Is it possible to automatically

79
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,600
 push someone to a specific server for the world?"

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:33,680
 As weirdly overloaded term for Neos, it is possible to host a headless session that exists

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,120
 and is always up, or is up as long as your headless host is up, and make that available

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,320
 to be easily joined in a variety of mechanisms, yes, it just depends on the exact specifics

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,240
 of your circumstances.

84
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,620
 For example, it's possible to make a headless world and then give everyone that you want

85
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:57,080
 to join a shortcut or batch file for Windows which launches them straight into that world.

86
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,560
 You can also use various invite links and things like that to get them in there.

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,900
 When doing that, make sure that you're utilising custom session IDs, because that way you don't

88
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,040
 have to change the session ID in the link that the linker just posted.

89
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:18,000
 As a good example here, the MMC voting system uses the same custom session ID each year,

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,580
 which means that gadgets or widgets that take you to the voting world that worked last year

91
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,580
 will work next year.

92
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,340
 But there are no remaining questions in the list, so we can sit here and chill out for

93
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,020
 a minute if additional questions come in, that's absolutely fine.

94
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
 Hope everyone's doing well.

95
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,460
 Does anyone know what a foot hammock is?

96
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,140
 Because I have a foot hammock and I just repaired it.

97
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,380
 I had to buy rope.

98
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:44,600
 Because a foot hammock is like $12 to $15 on Amazon, but I'd ordered two and I broke

99
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
 both of them.

100
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,960
 And then the rope got frayed and then snapped.

101
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,660
 So I was like, I'm going to order rope and repair it using rope this time, because that

102
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,100
 seems cheaper, because I can just keep repairing it when the rope frays.

103
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,340
 So I ordered rope and I thought I got the right size, but the rope's too small, so it's

104
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
 going to break more frequently.

105
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,740
 So now I have to make the choice of, do I want to repair it more frequently with additional

106
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,420
 rope, or do I want to get a better foot hammock that's not going to have the fraying problems?

107
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,560
 So that's my predicament.

108
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,680
 The reason why that's front of mind is because the spool of rope I bought is next to me.

109
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,580
 I could have ordered, I don't know, like a small amount of rope, but this large amount

110
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,560
 of rope which I ordered was cheaper.

111
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,980
 It was like double the rope for a dollar.

112
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,500
 Like I'm looking at that spool and I just know that spool's going to be with me for

113
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
 like five years.

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,820
 I'd be like a strange sort of pet in the closet somewhere.

115
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,020
 It's just a two millimeter diameter natural rope, that's it.

116
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,660
 I should have got four millimeter diameter.

117
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,380
 Oh well, what are you going to do?

118
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,260
 I should always like change up the rigging of the foot hammock as well, like do my own

119
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,820
 sort of knots and that way it would last longer.

120
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,180
 So I'll do that if the current roping I've got fails.

121
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,180
 I know this is random, this is what happens when we have no questions, we talk about rope.

122
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,460
 Tabbing back over to take a look at questions.

123
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,860
 So we have a non-neos question, I reserve that because we have neos questions coming

124
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
 in.

125
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,860
 As Lincoln says, 21 people in on the office hour, but so little in here.

126
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,780
 Do you think I have a general "hey the thread exists", everyone just listening in?

127
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:18,660
 Yeah, if you want to ask questions, go in the thread, ask questions in the thread.

128
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,700
 Now an interesting question which is philosophical in nature from Dove here who says "would you

129
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,880
 say that VR as a whole is a form of escapism or more a form of a new social interaction

130
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
 or both?"

131
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,260
 It's true, neither.

132
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:38,380
 It can be used for escapism, due to current circumstances it has become less of an escapism

133
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:44,900
 for myself personally, but I get the whole escapism angle, I would encourage people that

134
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,780
 are using it in that way to ensure they're doing that healthily.

135
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,180
 You can get addicted to basically anything, so try not to get addicted to the escapism

136
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,660
 of VR.

137
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,180
 A new social interaction is also true, yes, so I'd probably say both.

138
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,840
 I think about it this way, right?

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,040
 So I live in a rental, and in a rental, as I'm sure you're aware, you're limited

140
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,220
 in what you can do to decorate, and so most of the time you're gonna find that it's

141
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,620
 like, hard wood furniture that you take to each rental that you live in, not much stuff

142
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,040
 on the walls, and white walls or beige walls or that horrible grey colour they sometimes

143
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,540
 paint apartments, right?

144
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,140
 But if I put on a headset, no matter which rental I live in, I can be on the moon, I

145
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,940
 can walk along the Great Wall of China, I can go to a nice field, I can touch grass.

146
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,480
 That's escapism.

147
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,880
 But I can also put on my headset and speak to people from all across the world.

148
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,720
 I don't know if, yep, they're here listening, so I see Soap, Admiral Soap, moderator from

149
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,060
 our community here, they're in Finland, right?

150
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,800
 I don't know anyone in Finland until I walked VR, now I know someone in Finland!

151
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
 It's cool.

152
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
 Sorry to call you out, Soap.

153
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,980
 Yeah, moving onwards.

154
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,820
 Lax says "I found that the OnStartLogix node doesn't fire when I'd like it to when

155
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,900
 loading the worldstroke object that it's in.

156
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,980
 It fired before the logic's fully loaded, breaking the chain.

157
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,840
 Would you know a way to make the logics, to make a logic's pulse, pulses whenever a user

158
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,420
 is loaded into the world, just the data without the assets?"

159
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
 Have you tried OnLoaded?

160
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,420
 Is it onloaded?

161
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,000
 Am I just forgetting now?

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,020
 You know how you navigate it to every logic's folder on the planet multiple times, but you

163
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,180
 just forget?

164
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,140
 You forget what's in each one.

165
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,340
 I'd have to look into how OnStart works, and those event nodes in more detail.

166
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,460
 I know I always confuse OnStart with OnLoad, which is why I think it exists.

167
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,220
 Sometimes I also have fun when I use OnDuplicate, and then I forget, and I duplicate the grab

168
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,620
 instancer thingamabobby.

169
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,700
 To explain that better without using the phrase "thingamabobby", because that doesn't

170
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,980
 make any sense, let's say you have a grab instancer, which is where you grab something

171
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,860
 and it makes a clone of something, and then you have an OnDuplicate node on that template,

172
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,140
 then it'll run some logic when you grab instancer.

173
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,140
 But it'll also run that if you happen to duplicate the template holder.

174
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,940
 So let's say you have a bowl of cookies, where the cookie graphic is a baked mesh,

175
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,540
 and when you grab on the bowl of cookies it spawns a single cookie, and that's what

176
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,140
 you grab with the grab instancer, and I don't know, the cookie makes an explosion noise

177
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,860
 when you grab it because of OnDuplicate, if you duplicate the table that the cookies are

178
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,860
 on, you'll get an explosion noise, which is often fun.

179
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,860
 Try OnStart.

180
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,460
 Wait, not OnStart, OnLoaded.

181
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:47,260
 There's also the hacky thing that the playerlist module thing in the mystic-ford, no not mystic-ford,

182
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:55,580
 the polylogics folder does, they see if a localised boolean is true, and use that to

183
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,300
 do their playerlist, that might work.

184
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,460
 Alright we have a question, good.

185
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,460
 Playercovey says "Semi-blender to Neo's question, I made a 3D model of a text and

186
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,820
 it was made in a special font where it is more complicated than Times New Roman, but

187
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,700
 important to Neo some letters, p's and o's and sometimes a is important to any words

188
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,020
 in concave or not to keep the arches.

189
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,820
 I can continue to find a way to solve this problem via the question channel but not show

190
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,100
 this common issue for Neo's invention where it prefers more flat surface rather than complex

191
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
 holes in 3D models.

192
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,500
 I can absolutely help you out there.

193
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,900
 Before you export that piece of text you need to triangulate it.

194
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,620
 I predict this is what's happening, I don't know for certain, but try this.

195
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,960
 There is an operation you can do in edit mode, or you can use it as a modifier in the modifier

196
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,040
 stack of Blender, where it will convert any weird geometry down to triangles before export,

197
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,260
 and that will generically help with that kind of thing.

198
00:12:51,260 --> 00:13:00,380
 The importer that we use for models and meshes etc doesn't like weird vertex stuff.

199
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:07,080
 I'd love to state that quads are the way of the future, because of course they are, but

200
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,540
 in some cases you just need triangles, man.

201
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,860
 Some of the export options on Blender will also do an auto-triangulate before export,

202
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,740
 I can't remember which ones will do that though.

203
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
 Triangulation is the problem.

204
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,660
 Yeah, try triangulation, and then from there we can try some other stuff.

205
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,820
 The other thing you have to check is to make sure that it's not generating any upside down

206
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
 normals.

207
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,060
 If it's doing that, then you might see some oddities as well.

208
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,940
 So once you've generated the text you could look at sort of recalculating the normals

209
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
 as well.

210
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,660
 With that, I don't see many additional questions coming in, so do remember if you are listening

211
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,660
 and want to ask a question about NES, please drop it in the Office Hours text chat, there's

212
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,380
 a few channels about the one you're currently staring at.

213
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,260
 I keep forgetting that stages now have chat, so maybe at some point we'll swap to using

214
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,780
 the stage chat, because that actually would help the whole "where do we ask questions"

215
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
 thing.

216
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,940
 Thank you for those who are redirecting those things.

217
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,460
 Yeah, soap says "don't know if we can archive stage chats the same way" I'm not sure either.

218
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:17,900
 It's really weird how with a handful of additional features or tweaks, Discord could be a really

219
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,220
 good app for this sort of things.

220
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,780
 For this sort of things, you know what I mean.

221
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,500
 For these sort of things.

222
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,340
 But it kind of misses it.

223
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:33,820
 Moving forward, we have a question from Lex, who says "how does the world relation enum

224
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:40,260
 on the open world logics node and link component work?"

225
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,540
 So that is a holdover from some of the old stuff that we don't really use anymore.

226
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:51,540
 I'm not quite sure we haven't removed that, because it's almost almost better to use independent

227
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,700
 these days.

228
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:03,780
 So if you remember the balls in your hand that you would use to switch worlds, if anyone

229
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,940
 is new to NES, I apologise, this next like five minutes is going to sound like a fever

230
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
 dream.

231
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,180
 Legacy World Switcher, there you go.

232
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,020
 I just called it like the balls in my hands.

233
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,100
 I called it much more offensive names occasionally.

234
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,040
 Lollipop Menu is something else that people called it.

235
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,580
 It's called the Legacy World Switcher.

236
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,980
 The Legacy World Switcher formed a sort of branching tree pattern based on the worlds

237
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:34,100
 that you opened, and it was sort of like where they came from, how you linked into them,

238
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,540
 and things like that.

239
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,900
 Those are what those enums usually control.

240
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,460
 So the first one, where were the values?

241
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,100
 Whoever deleted the values, I'm going to like shake your fist, because I was going to run

242
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,620
 through them in a list, so put the values back, and I'll go through them in a list!

243
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,860
 I didn't have them to hand!

244
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,540
 Independent Nest and Replace, I think.

245
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,900
 There we go, thank you so much, Linker.

246
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:08,100
 So Independent makes an independent branch on that World Switcher, so it'll just be a

247
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,220
 new branch that occurs, like a new branch.

248
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,140
 Nest will usually make it an extension of an existing branch, so the branch will extend

249
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:26,420
 by one length, and then Replace, I believe Replace will close the session that you're

250
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,860
 currently in, and load you into the new session of the OpenWorld Logics node in the same place

251
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,460
 in the tree as that one.

252
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,060
 Like I said, I don't know why that still exists.

253
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,900
 There may be some additional behaviour that happens there, because I do know there is

254
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,940
 still an order to sessions.

255
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:53,020
 Even with sessions now being either in the World

256
00:16:53,020 --> 00:17:19,980
 or in the

257
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:27,580
 links from messages and contacts and invites and stuff like that, it just -- I'd love to

258
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,340
 standardize that down a little bit further so it makes sense.

259
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,540
 In fact, you know after a hard night of Neos partying on your legacy World Switcher, it

260
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,740
 looks like a complete mess?

261
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,740
 In some cases, that's what the World Manager code looks like when you're starting sessions.

262
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,740
 Just like, wait, where are we?

263
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,860
 Oh yeah, I'm in the code which does it from the website.

264
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,980
 I should be in the code that does it from the World Link component.

265
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,700
 Okay, here we go, let's go over here.

266
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,900
 Ooh, that's a good question there from Player Cody, who says "Is there a component on a

267
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,900
 3D model where any all applied materials will fix the stretch size, you need a rectangle

268
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,220
 shape to look like a wall?

269
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,580
 I see that two out of the four sides will look natural when applying materials with

270
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,860
 siding, when the other two sides will look stretched."

271
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,980
 That is UV mapping.

272
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,660
 We're unfortunately limited in the support that we can provide in-game to edit those

273
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,540
 UV mappings of those primitives right now.

274
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,820
 So that's what you're experiencing there.

275
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,020
 You can mess with on the primitives, usually there's a UV scale input box for UV scale,

276
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
 so you can try that.

277
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,780
 There is also UV scale on, it's usually called texture scale though, on the materials, you

278
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,220
 can try that.

279
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,100
 If all else fails, you can try a triplanar material.

280
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:44,060
 When it comes to triplanar, I use that as sort of like the last vestige of sanity, because

281
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,520
 I believe there is a performance cost to the triplanar one.

282
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,220
 There is also the problem with the triplanar, which is if you move the object you'll start

283
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,340
 to see the triplanar scrolling.

284
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,860
 You can fix that by checking the object space checkbox in the material for that though.

285
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,600
 When checking object space into it, it messes up all the scale components because it recalculates

286
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,940
 like all the maths and you're like "Ah, my texture scale is wrong now, I need to replace

287
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,220
 it with more numbers!"

288
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,580
 So I've come across that a lot.

289
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,460
 A good example for triplanar that occurs is the convex hole rock brushes, I believe those

290
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,380
 use triplanar by default, because they're sort of undefined objects until the convex

291
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,380
 hole is drawn.

292
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,820
 You can see an in-game UV editor in the future, that would be great, you'd be able to fix

293
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
 up stuff like that.

294
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:33,140
 I know that's part of the logic from the Ringen and the Nylander that Sloppy made, they made

295
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,460
 a lot of custom geometry for that tool, where the UVs were set up in a particular way to

296
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,420
 make that sort of problem less prevalent.

297
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,780
 Trizes and triangles, yes, playcoding.

298
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
 That might work.

299
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,160
 I haven't personally seen that fix it, but if it works, then it works.

300
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,460
 With that, I don't see any additional questions, and we are at the limit.

301
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,280
 Well, one of the possible limits that occurs depends on the conversation currently happening.

302
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,740
 So any last call for questions?

303
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,620
 Anyone got any additional questions?

304
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,500
 Thanks, Duff.

305
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,740
 Did I miss 4.11?

306
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,620
 I'll double check that, because I thought I did 4.11 before I went over to vacation.

307
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,620
 I'll get them fixed up and linked.

308
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,140
 I know it takes a while, it's just because sometimes I need my computer's resources,

309
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,540
 and running the text through transcription is taking a lot.

310
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:34,820
 I do need to do the whole "I'm a nerdy male who lives alone in their apartment, let me

311
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,540
 put a server rack in the corner" I need to do that, but I've got time for that, and then

312
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,820
 I'll be able to run it on that, but I need PC resources to do stuff sometimes.

313
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,020
 So I'll try and get that up to date.

314
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,460
 Angry says "Why are Qods better than Trize?"

315
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:56,980
 Qods are easily manipulatable in Blender, using quad-based operations, things like edge rings,

316
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,220
 edge loops, various other terminologies for that.

317
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,980
 If you just imagine an elastic band around your arm, and you slide that elastic band

318
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,260
 up and down your arm, that is what the topology of an arm on an avatar should look like in

319
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
 Qods, right?

320
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:20,760
 It should look like that, and each time you move that elastic band, that would be a loop

321
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,440
 of Qods that are linked together, and you can subdivide those Qods really easily by

322
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,380
 just splitting them in half down the midpoint, and then you have two Qods on either side.

323
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:39,320
 The problems that occur with those is that some engine, some importing thing, some shaders,

324
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,540
 some textures, some stuff like that, can't deal with them as well.

325
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,540
 They need the extra information that occurs from the extra triangles in triangles.

326
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,540
 So a Quad is four points, and to represent a Quad in triangles, you usually will double

327
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:00,200
 up each of those points, because then you have a triangle where two of the points overlap

328
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,120
 between the two triangles.

329
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,560
 With that, I'm going to go ahead and leave off there.

330
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,180
 I'll get the notes updated as soon as I can, like I said, and if you have any additional

331
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,820
 questions, please drop them in the Questions at Help channel, or direct message me directly.

332
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
 That's a redundant statement.

333
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,140
 And I will see you again next week for more Office Hours.

334
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,860
 Make sure to bring your best questions.

335
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
 Speak to you soon.
