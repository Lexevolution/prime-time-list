1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Welcome to the top of the hour, it is time for office hours.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 I'm going to go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 So first we have a question which is about something that happened before the recording started,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 so I'll just restate it.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Yeah, today I said I was having computer troubles in the office hours text chat.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 What happened there was I have a KVM because I used to have a work machine

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 and I just set it up at this desk, you know, all like COVID matters.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 And I got really used to it because it made a great separation between work and home.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Like I didn't have Discord installed on the work machine, for example,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 so you guys couldn't bug me about Neos issues.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 But then I didn't need the KVM, but I didn't disconnect the KVM

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 because I probably will at some point need to use it again.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 So it's still plumbed in and it's got a switch,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 and the left setting of the switch is "Home computer, Neos, oog oog"

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 and the right switch of the KVM is "Computer that does not exist".

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And in cleaning my desk yesterday I had knocked that switch over to the second computer,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 and so when I turned on the computer today it was like "I don't work".

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And it was working, it just didn't have any inputs or outputs

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 because the KVM was like "I'm a KVM, doing my KVM things".

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 So that's why Lex then asked "How did you figure out it was the KVM?"

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 KVM's got an LED on it, and as I sort of looked down in despair at my keyboard

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 as I was whacking keys on my keyboard to see if it worked,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I noticed the LED was in the wrong spot, so I changed it back to the correct position.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And then I felt very silly.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Anyway, moving onwards.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Revi says "Didn't know that there was an Office Hours on Tuesday".

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I am the only Office Hours other than the moderation Office Hours on Sunday that exists right now.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 You can always check out the schedule on wiki.neos.com.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I am the longest running Office Hours segment,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 and I am trying to keep that going, a bit like a streak on a video game.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I do miss some, but when I miss some I let you know ahead of time.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I don't purposely miss some.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 There have been a couple occurrences where I've sort of ran across the room

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 whilst cooking dinner and been like "Oh crap, it's Office Hours!"

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 and done Office Hours whilst running backwards and forwards across my room, cooking dinner.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 If you know which one that is and you find that recording, good.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Because you probably won't be able to tell.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Anyway, moving forwards.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Ozi asks "Do you have any suggestions for doing click videos for Tutorials for Neos?"

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 For some reason it takes me a good five takes to explain even the simplest piece of logic to know how to use it.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 That's what I do.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So, you know, long been told "Hey, no editing".

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 If a video takes ten minutes to record, and I can do it in five takes,

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 and the fifth take is a good one, that means the net total time for that video taken to be produced is 50 minutes.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And often it's less than that, right? So 50 minutes for a ten minute video.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 If I were to put all of that 50 minutes of footage into an editor, I would start min-maxing it.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Where I'd be like "Oh, I didn't like the delivery of that line".

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 You had a mild, like, slur of your words, which frequently happen because English is just not my first language apparently, even though it literally is.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 In that particular sentence you should re-record it.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 People say "Don't use filler words like um or like or uh".

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And I'm just like, as you can tell, I'm just "But why?"

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So it would then min-max and it would turn into "Great, this 50 minutes of footage now needs to be processed for an hour, maybe two hours, all to get like a perfect ten minute video".

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Which of course then needs a thumbnail and an intro and the whole like "like and subscribe" shit.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 So it would turn into "Greater than 50 minutes".

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And that I think will always be the case, unless I learn editing sufficiently where I can get a video down.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 But then even then, with editing added, it adds the whole min-maxing thing where you're like "Hey, I want the best take of this".

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 There's a great video which I'll dig up in a gap between questions from a creator where they talk about this phenomenon of sort of always acting.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's in relevance to a show by a - I'll just find the video and it will jog all the memory, my brain is not connecting there right now.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 It's a show called this, with this person and about this stuff by this YouTuber.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 All of those things are blank, but the moment I find the video I know exactly what I'm looking for.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So I'll be able to remember all of those. Anyway, moving forwards.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Lex asks "Any updates, game-wise, communication-wise on fixes for session thumbnails not working, Neo2p video links not working, Linux native users not being able to use Neo?"

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 It's okay, I didn't realize that one existed anytime soon.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 The team are working on it, we are having communication about it.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I have expressed our need to get everything in sync and working and we will work on it as soon as we can.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I can look for that video now, can't I? Yes, I can.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I think it's this channel.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I'll do videos and then - yeah, there it is.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Okay, this is a one hour video essay, but you'll understand a lot more about how the real world works and how YouTube works.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And you'll also start to appreciate alternative forms of media as well.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Super eye patch warfare about towards the end of that video he illustrates that -

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Okay, I'll basically give a brief summary.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Nathan Fielder makes a bunch of documentaries where the longer you watch them, the longer it becomes uncertain if you're actually watching Nathan Fielder.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So there are a variety of actors that exist in the world who are just always acting when they're in the public view.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And so you never actually get their real personality.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 You can see this in cases like Nathan Fielder.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 There's also other ones - I think, what's her name? Not Miley Cyrus.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 There's a few pop singers that do the same thing as well, right?

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 They are just like 100% like a different character because they are in the public eye than compared to sort of, I don't know, in their own house.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And you know, it's just a really interesting way to look at things like that.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And then throughout the video he says, while this may seem strange, you're actually always seeing it because of the way that YouTube promotes us to, you know, edit our videos.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And so he then shows the like five or six takes of him saying that exact sentence, and he says, "And I pick the one that sounds the best.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Even if I don't know why it sounds the best, I still have to record five and pick the fifth, you know, the best one."

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Engineered personality, that is a great term for it there, Evie, thank you.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And that's what you're seeing a lot of the times when people edit their videos.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 You are seeing that in some aspects of me, of course, I can't control that because I do record multiple takes.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But if the take is going well and I make a mild mistake, I'm just going to keep rolling so you like see a sort of fractured mirror of that as the video progresses.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 If I make more and more mistakes, like you're seeing a fractured vision of that engineered personality.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And if you read the outtakes video, you're kind of seeing what my brain is doing 24/7 and also what most of the outtakes are.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I literally, all of that.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Moving forwards to Fuzzy's question, now we have another question, so I don't rant about Nathan Fielder for about an hour,

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 but I could, or you could just watch the iPatchibles video about it, which is an hour long.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Anyway, Fuzzy says, "Why is UIX such a pig to work with?"

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I totally agree.

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 But they have a specificity, that's a complicated word to say when you haven't had enough coffee.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 "Putting text and images on a facet, then they don't scale down nicely when you install it on the dash and everywhere goes black."

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Hmm.

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 One of the bigger problems of UIX in that area, I'd love to see that link by the way, Tron, sorry I'm like reading messages as they come in.

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So Fuzzy, one of the issues in that area is that whenever you develop UIX, you might have the tendency to sort of think about it in absolutes.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So you are, I actually saw Easton do this, I don't know if Easton is here today, if you're here, I'm sorry I just like, called you out, I don't know if you're here.

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I saw Easton was developing a card game of some sort, and he was struggling making the sort of icons be the right size, etc.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And again, it was this 'cause this problem.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It's like, yeah, you might think that you want your image to be 50 pixels by 50 pixels on your facet,

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 but what you're actually saying is, "I want it to take up 50 pixels of the available space to me."

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And then based on that facet scaling or shrinking, the available space shrinks and grows.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 So that's the problem that you're dealing with with images.

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 On the image component itself, there is a checkbox called 'preserve aspect ratio', make sure that's checked on,

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 and then that will preserve the aspect ratio of the image depending on sort of how weirdly it is stretched.

109
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 It does that thing where it'll get sort of smaller and towards the center as you scale the facet.

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I highly recommend not using exact pixel values when doing facets.

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Use the flexible height and flexible width of the layout components to layout your UI, and then it'll work at any scale.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Lex has some additional information here that says that there was a plan to set the scale of the UIX on the dash to be 1 instead of 0.005,

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 and the unit scale to 1000 instead of 1, but the update never got released when the UIX meant for facets, needs to have this in mind,

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 and use the old scaling method instead of the unit scale field.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I've not used the unit scale field ever on both facets I've made and UI I've made, so I was not aware of either being a problem.

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 They had some user like a month or two back that was trying to use unit scale for something and just didn't understand it,

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 and I looked at the code and I'm like, "I don't understand either. Maybe that was that."

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Speaking about the engineer personality, there's also a very good video by philosophy_youtube about Abigail.

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Where are we? This one. No no no no no no.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Yeah, this is it.

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 So, Abigail came out as trans, I think, what's the date of this? I can't see the date, YouTube.

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Two years ago, yeah.

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And the way that they did it was they actually hired an actor to sort of read a script, and then the actor kind of like fades out,

124
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 and then she walks into the room and goes like, "This is me," and it's again sort of like a massive break of the engineered personality,

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 but then it was instantly into her new personality and it was really good.

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So there's that video.

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Morph asks, "I know that Sync Delegates is basically stuff behind the scenes, but could we get a better description of it in the future?"

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 It pops up every now and again and there's no information about it.

129
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 In the future, yes, you can get some more information on it.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I still, when I see people overusing them, I like to sort of encourage them to sort of ask questions about what they're doing,

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 because sometimes people are doing something incredibly wrong.

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Like I've seen people messing with Sync Delegates because they just didn't understand the right logic node, for example.

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And it's like, you don't need to understand Sync Delegates to use the right logic node.

134
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I also saw someone who was trying to use Sync Delegates to use the right node without unpacking it,

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 because, you know, logic is quote "bad", it's not.

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 So be careful.

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Lex says, "I'd like to run multiple headless sessions on different accounts. Is the only way to do that using multiple headless clients?"

138
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Currently, yes.

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I would love if we could have like a world override for the user,

140
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 where you can, you know, for the start words configuration, you could put in a different username and password. That would be good.

141
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I actually don't know, though, if the engine is up to be like that.

142
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I know that like half of you here have decompiled it, so you'll understand what I'm saying.

143
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 For those who haven't, or those that aren't technically minded,

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 when you start up Neos and you log in a user, you basically inform the engine,

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 "I am logging in as this user. I am this user."

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And the engine goes, "Okay, you are this user everywhere."

147
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And it like spreads your username far and wide, so like all things like the dash works, where it says your username,

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 your contacts work, so you can get your messages, your user space, you know,

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 it's like "Oh, you're out of space, you can't sync, so that works", you know.

150
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 All those things.

151
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And so make multiple accounts working on the same executable would basically be like,

152
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 "Don't spread it around so much. Get a smaller spread on that."

153
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Ah, Trom has found the Jacksepticeye video that I was looking for, so I would watch that after this.

154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Revy commenting, "The headless stuff said it would be a lot of work for something only a few,

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 very few small amount of people could benefit from."

156
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Yeah. This is again where it comes up, the sort of like juggling of things that we could work on.

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 For example, would it be more beneficial to enable multiple user accounts for a headless client,

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 or would it be more beneficial to make the headless client more efficient?

159
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Because if the headless client was more efficient, you could run multiple copies of it on the same hardware,

160
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 and then you've got the same thing. And one of those might be easier than the other.

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I don't know about looking into it, but one of those may be easier than the other.

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And there goes another sort of XY problem, like what is your problem?

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Oh, you want to run more headless users on the same hardware, right?

164
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 That would also be factored into the official server support that we have.

165
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Remember, headless clients is just sort of like a hold gap between now and when we would have official server support.

166
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 That is right, yeah. One user could crash and not the other.

167
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I'm not sure that would occur beyond the world level.

168
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 I mean, that's always in the thing. On headlases, you can have a single world on a headless crash,

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 and you can have the entire headless crash. Like both of those happen.

170
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I don't know if that would change it. But yeah, if you used multiple headless clients on the same hardware,

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 containerized or VMD or whatever, then even if the headless crashed,

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 then it would only affect that one user's worlds.

173
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 If you have no questions, I'll go ahead and mute, and we'll wait for some additional questions, guys.

174
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Type those questions if you've got them.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Alright, we've got some questions bouncing up, so I'll go ahead and get those answered.

176
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 So Ozzy says, "Related to the horrible clock logics I found earlier,

177
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 what's the most horrifyingly unoptimized piece of logic you've seen?"

178
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 We had an interesting run-in with the... there's like an old calculator, I think Outsider made it.

179
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It's parented to a PHX plate, which is... anyone that's played Garry's Mod knows exactly what that is.

180
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 For anyone who doesn't, it's basically a metal plate.

181
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 But for those who did play Garry's Mod, their brain just went, "Ooh, I know that!"

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 It was made really early on in Logix's creation, and...

183
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I don't know, someone asked me, "How does it work?"

184
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And I unpacked it, and I just went, "I don't know."

185
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I have no idea!

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 If you can find that piece of thing, unpack it, it'll just be like, "What the..."

187
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Ekka says, "Why cheese?" I don't answer cheese questions.

188
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Go all the way back to the first couple of office hours, you'll see the cheese questions there.

189
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 That's why I don't, because if I don't have that stance, I'll just answer them every week, and we can't be having that.

190
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Jackal says, "Have you found that someone made an absolutely Rube Goldbergian Logix construction that was so awful it was beautiful?"

191
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Was it done on purpose, or just a miracle to some very strange mode of thinking?

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Yeah, Baxter does most of those.

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Shifty did one.

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 She did a helicopter, where the helicopter blades are the Logix which powers the helicopter.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Baxter does a few in that regard.

196
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 I kind of see all of the meta memes as kind of that as well.

197
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 You're using Logix to sort of break the... it's not the fourth wall because it's a video player,

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 but I feel like there should be a wall term referred to for the video player, right?

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 You're breaking the video player.

200
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Yes it is the fourth wall because some of the stuff comes out of the video player.

201
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You know what I mean though.

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 What I haven't seen though is a true Rube Goldberg machine.

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It exists and is created just to have some sort of ever-changing, ever-expanding process or looping animation or something like that.

204
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 There was an interesting show on... I'm going to do Minecraft for a second here, welcome to a rant.

205
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Over on a Minecraft YouTuber's channel, Direwolf20, if you know them, quite a big YouTuber.

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 They did a show called Wrenched for a Bit, where four contestants, sometimes teams but usually just four people,

207
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 were split into four quadrants of a map and they were given all of the items in all of the modpacks that were installed on the server.

208
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 But they had to, in I think 20 or 30 minutes, create something that used a random block, a random fluid, and a random resource or something along those lines.

209
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So they had to incorporate three random objects and those were always good.

210
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Because sometimes the objects were functional, sometimes the objects were beautiful pieces of art.

211
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 The best one I ever made was with Red Power 2 in Minecraft. This is going to be very difficult to explain but I'll try.

212
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 So you know how sand falls when you place it above nothing? It'll fall to the ground in Minecraft.

213
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 What I made was a Red Power 2 thing where the sand fell and then a Red Power 2 thing would break that block.

214
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 The sand block would travel in a Red Power 2 tube up to the top where there was a Red Power 2 placement block which would then place the sand again.

215
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 So what we then had is just an infinitely falling piece of sand and it was like, this is artistic.

216
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 So I haven't seen anything big like that.

217
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Moving down to the next question, Morph says "How do I get the same function of deselect all from the dev tool as a button in my context menu?"

218
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 If you equip the dev tool then it'll appear as a button in your context menu. Troll face.

219
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 No, I know what you mean. You want it in there even when maybe you're not equipping the tool.

220
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 I don't know if you can. That would be one of the cases where you might need to look into sync delegates.

221
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I wouldn't recommend that approach though. Just equip the tool.

222
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 It's still in Neos Essentials? Maybe we should update Neos Essentials. I mean, I always should do that.

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 So Ozzy was saying that the calculator of Doom is in Neos Essentials. Yeah, it is.

224
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Probably shouldn't be, but it is there. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me.

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 There we go.

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Lex says "Would you know of an easy way to bake lighting into textures for a model?" I would use Blender.

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 There's a couple of Blender add-ons which I purchased long ago, and I don't really remember purchasing them.

228
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 But one of them just does all my light baking for me, but I can't remember what it's called because I haven't done light baking in about six months.

229
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So I'd have to go remind myself what it was called. There we go.

230
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Glavin says "I and several other users have an issue recently where Neos hitches every second or two. Seems to randomly happen, most when joining the world.

231
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Curious if you or others have any experience with this and some insight into what might be causing the issue."

232
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 OK, so there could be a number of things. So number one is your avatar is too big. It's got too much stuff on it.

233
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I'm not going to say slot count because it's not related to slot count, despite what people say, it's the amount of stuff on the avatar.

234
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 If you reduce the amount of stuff on your avatar, it will naturally reduce the slot count. Anyway.

235
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 The worlds are too big and are doing the same thing as the avatar thing, so that could be that.

236
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Because yeah, I have random hitches when joining worlds and have had for like four plus years.

237
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 In fact, I had the thing at the start of my playing Neos, but you have to restart it every 45 minutes because the garbage collector was just not doing its job.

238
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 As for like recently anything changing, I can't really think. The only thing I can think of is because we're not going via CloudClaire anymore.

239
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Like if you're geographically coded far away from like our main location, then it might be because the assets are taking longer to download.

240
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 I don't know. Maybe a log might help.

241
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 If you can open an issue with a log file, I might be able to take a look.

242
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 If they are increasing, it's definitely something we should look into.

243
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 But I do get the hitches that you're describing just all the time.

244
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 By the way, and this isn't going to affect the people that aren't in the audience, of course, so spread the word.

245
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 When someone is loading into the world, don't run up and say hi to them until they've like moved or something.

246
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 In fact, if you're making a world, make a loading hut of some kind in your world.

247
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Big Red Wolfie makes a loading hut in like they've got an island that you spawn in and then you teleport down to the main area.

248
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 That's great. Most sort of club or theatre or like hangout worlds sometimes have like an elevator or maybe an entrance hall that you spawn in.

249
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 That's fantastic. Don't run up to people who are loading.

250
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I literally can't see who you are and sometimes your audio is garbled as well.

251
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I have someone running up to me. They're entirely invisible. Sometimes their name badge loads first.

252
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,600
 They wave at me and they go like, "Ha!

253
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,440
 Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right."

254
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,920
 And I'm just like, "I don't know who you are, what you look like, or anything like that.

255
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,080
 So just don't."

256
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,400
 Which also reminds me, move off of spawn.

257
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,600
 If spawn is a room or an area that is for loading, move off.

258
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,680
 Move off of spawn.

259
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,720
 I have no idea who you are, because you haven't loaded yet.

260
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,080
 I'm Aaron R. Says "Your headache feeling better?"

261
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,520
 No, it's got worse.

262
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,600
 Looking down for questions, Morph says "Speaking of avatars being too big, what's a reasonable

263
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 sized avatar?

264
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,600
 I'm talking full IK for high performance avatars, even in something from 10 megabytes to 200

265
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 megabytes."

266
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,560
 I don't want to give numbers that aren't researched, or evaluated or established.

267
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,640
 I know what I would personally do, but if I say them, people start quoting them, they're

268
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,640
 like "Neo's team member states that your avatar must be 100 megabytes.

269
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,320
 It is not 100 megabytes.

270
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,120
 You will now face the council to have your fate decided."

271
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,560
 So I'm not going to say numbers unless they're researched, and if they're researched they'll

272
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
 go on the wiki.

273
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,320
 That's the way I've just been doing information like that.

274
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,680
 I'm like, "I don't know, so we'll take it to the wiki."

275
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,600
 Even over on VRChat it's unclear as well.

276
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,840
 You can specify a limit on VRChat, but they don't really specify a limit for you.

277
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,400
 If I could say in a complete sentence that won't be taken out of occurrence what I would

278
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,360
 do, then maybe, cool.

279
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,520
 You also have to look at is that the right measurement?

280
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,640
 In terms of the file space, sometimes no, because it usually is inaccurate because of

281
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,800
 the way that we calculate file spaces right now.

282
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,540
 Then you sort of think, "Well, cool.

283
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,880
 Is it the number of slots?"

284
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,200
 It is not the number of slots.

285
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,840
 And then it's like, "Well, is there too much logic surrounding it?"

286
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
 It's probably that.

287
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,080
 Have you parented too many guns to it?

288
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,320
 Probably.

289
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,600
 When you open the context menu, does it spawn the Halo ring from Halo and play the orchestral

290
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,520
 choral Halo entrance music which occurs on the main menu of the game?

291
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,680
 That is an avatar that's too big.

292
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,120
 If it does that, it's too big.

293
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,200
 Do you have 17,000 pieces of information in your name badge that I don't need to know?

294
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
 Then it's too big.

295
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,080
 I still need to make the avatar which is entirely comprised of useless information.

296
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,880
 What I was going to do is I was going to buy hundreds of IoT sensors and put them in my

297
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 apartment.

298
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:03,040
 You know, like, water in my toilet, temperature of my bed, temperature of my doorway, wind

299
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,240
 flow through my windows, window moisture sensor.

300
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
 Yep, you're getting it.

301
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,760
 You just keep adding them.

302
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,400
 It's like, "Ah, yes, humidity in my bathroom.

303
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
 The light status.

304
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,040
 Are my living room lights on?

305
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,000
 Are my bedroom lights on?"

306
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,600
 Just keep doing it.

307
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,000
 The entire avatar is basically sort of like a collage of information that is technically

308
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,720
 accurate but completely useless.

309
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,640
 Trom linked another video.

310
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
 Is that interesting?

311
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,800
 That person on the left there, I forget their name.

312
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,680
 I just know them as the awesome psychologist YouTuber, that's how I refer to them in my

313
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,200
 head.

314
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,440
 They have a bunch of conversations with creators that basically look like public therapy sessions

315
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,760
 and it felt weird to me because that isn't something I would ever do publicly.

316
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,240
 These content creators are okay with it, so it's fine.

317
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,400
 Like he did two - Healthy Gamer GG, thank you for the name.

318
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,320
 He did one with Asmongold, actually he did two of Asmongold.

319
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,080
 I learned more about Asmongold in those two videos than I learned watching any of his

320
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,080
 videos and I now understand Asmongold completely and I'm like, "Wow, that's very interesting."

321
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
 I'll look for other questions.

322
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,960
 If you're talking about polygons, I guess is another one.

323
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,080
 That one you can keep down.

324
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,680
 Just try and get some numbers together that are tested and we can put them on the wiki.

325
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,320
 Otherwise it's just gonna be quoted out of context.

326
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
 Azeal.

327
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 What does Azeal do?

328
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 Easton?

329
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
 What do they do?

330
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,720
 I don't see any other questions so I'm just ranting at this point.

331
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,800
 We are at 37 so what is Azeal?

332
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
 What do they do?

333
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,560
 Oh, a platform for people to tell their stories, that's awesome.

334
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,920
 Oh, and because I've got the opportunity to and the audience, where are we?

335
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,400
 This person's content very much lines with how chaotic it is every time I leave the house.

336
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,680
 If I'm in the house, this sort of stuff doesn't happen, but if I'm outside the house, anything

337
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,200
 on her YouTube channel has happened and will happen to me.

338
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,720
 Where's the edible wedding?

339
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,200
 That's the story I was listening to the other day.

340
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,240
 Yes, edible wedding, yes.

341
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,280
 This is an amazing story.

342
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,840
 There we go.

343
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,880
 With that, if there are no additional weddings - if there are no additional weddings today,

344
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,920
 if there are no additional questions today, I'll leave off.

345
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,400
 I've got some stuff to do.

346
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,280
 If you have any other questions, questions and help.

347
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,920
 Oh, we've got some questions, we've got some questions!

348
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,120
 Oh my god, I'm so sorry, thank you for tagging them, whoever's doing the reactions, you're

349
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,440
 amazing and I love you.

350
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
 What's the weather like today?

351
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,680
 I don't know, my curtains are still closed.

352
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,600
 I have a headache, I don't want to open them.

353
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,480
 I also, because I live in an apartment that's rented, I have those extendable rods for hanging

354
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,360
 the curtains, and if I open the curtains, sometimes those rods will pop out, and then

355
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,720
 the entire curtain is in my hand, and I have to play with the rods to get them back in,

356
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,800
 because they're just tension fit, and it's really annoying.

357
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,880
 Sometimes I just don't open the curtains because I don't want to deal with that.

358
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,120
 I've been slowly tweaking the tension on those rods so that doesn't happen, but ideally I'd

359
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,680
 just like to put actual curtains up.

360
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,320
 Okay, that's that question.

361
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,520
 What do you think about VRC making an Android client?

362
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,640
 I love, generically, where VRC are going in what they're doing.

363
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,720
 I don't know if you guys can see it, and you can of course conspiracy theory this as much

364
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,400
 as you want, but the moment they were done with EAC, there was a significant uptick in

365
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,040
 their plans, their features, and their sort of, like if you imagine that they're a train,

366
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
 right?

367
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,840
 The train massively accelerated the moment they were done with EAC.

368
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,360
 So of course you can conspiracy theory that as much as you want, but the way I see it

369
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,120
 is the entire engineering team were caught up doing that feature so that they could protect

370
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,480
 their users, and now that their users are protected, and again, whatever you want to

371
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,680
 say is fine, they can focus on other things.

372
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,200
 It's great to see, regardless of your opinion on that whole matter, it is great to see that

373
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,600
 now that that is done, they are just like, accelerating, and it's scary, but at the same

374
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
 time it's good, right?

375
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,720
 I never want to wish ill on fellow platforms, they're doing a great job.

376
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,720
 And with that, I think we're done on questions, so I'm going to go ahead and lead off here.

377
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,240
 If you want to speak to me some more, DM me, post in questions and help, talk to me about

378
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
 cheese.

379
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,800
 Recommend me multiplayer video games that have conveyor belts in them, in my DMs, please.

380
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,640
 Conveyor video games that have conveyor belts in them, in my DMs.

381
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
 Okay, I need them.

382
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
 I'll speak to you later.
