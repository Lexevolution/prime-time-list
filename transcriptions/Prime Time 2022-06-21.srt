1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.000
Welcome to Primetime. It is 4pm, so we're gonna go ahead and get started.

2
0:00:04.000 --> 0:00:08.000
So this is the AMA office hours for any questions you might have about NEOS.

3
0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:12.000
Drop them in the office hours channel, that's two channels above the one that you're currently looking at.

4
0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:16.000
When there are no questions, we're gonna go ahead and just sit.

5
0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:20.000
You know, sit inside, because that's cool I guess.

6
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:24.000
So make sure you've got some questions, drop them in, I'll get to them as soon as I can.

7
0:00:24.000 --> 0:00:27.000
Otherwise, cheese? Yeah, cool.

8
0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:32.000
Something I realized I had not done, and I do apologize because this has been a month I haven't checked it,

9
0:00:32.000 --> 0:00:41.000
is I created a sheet where people can submit questions before I read them out at the office hours segment.

10
0:00:41.000 --> 0:00:45.000
And I'd completely forgot about that sheet, most likely because I'd lost the link to it.

11
0:00:45.000 --> 0:00:49.000
I did find the link the other day, I was just going through my Google Drive and I found it.

12
0:00:49.000 --> 0:00:51.000
And so I do have a question from that sheet.

13
0:00:51.000 --> 0:00:57.000
So I do apologize that that question exists, and I haven't answered it for like a month.

14
0:00:57.000 --> 0:01:02.000
But we'll go ahead and take a look and get that answered.

15
0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:08.000
Actually, this one isn't a question that would be able to be answered here anyway.

16
0:01:08.000 --> 0:01:15.000
But it does allow us to sort of give a preamble about why this keeps happening.

17
0:01:15.000 --> 0:01:19.000
So a user by the name of Yoshi, I won't mention the company name,

18
0:01:19.000 --> 0:01:27.000
they basically said like, hey, we're a sales agency of a computer and industrial product company in Japan.

19
0:01:27.000 --> 0:01:33.000
And hold on, my spreadsheet isn't big enough to take a look at this.

20
0:01:33.000 --> 0:01:35.000
Oh, I'm on the wrong Google account.

21
0:01:35.000 --> 0:01:40.000
I'll log in and hit another Google account to properly read that question because it is too long.

22
0:01:40.000 --> 0:01:43.000
There we go. That's better.

23
0:01:43.000 --> 0:01:50.000
Yeah, so they're a company that was just to obtain a pro license and they're asking for any questions.

24
0:01:50.000 --> 0:01:52.000
They're asking to sort of talk questions about that.

25
0:01:52.000 --> 0:01:58.000
So that preamble basically leads to, hey, if you want a pro license, I severely, severely suggest that before purchasing,

26
0:01:58.000 --> 0:02:05.000
you go ahead and you open up an email at hello at Neos dot com and wait for a response before you purchase Pro,

27
0:02:05.000 --> 0:02:09.000
because most of the time you probably won't need it these days.

28
0:02:09.000 --> 0:02:10.000
That's that preamble.

29
0:02:10.000 --> 0:02:13.000
So with that, we actually have that question sorted. It's actually invalid.

30
0:02:13.000 --> 0:02:18.000
I can't really answer it that effectively. Cool.

31
0:02:18.000 --> 0:02:23.000
If there are any other questions, drop them in the office hours chat and I'll get to them as soon as I can.

32
0:02:23.000 --> 0:02:29.000
Cool. What I'm doing in the background actually is making some edits to an OBS plugin.

33
0:02:29.000 --> 0:02:32.000
So you know how I don't edit? I'm like, I don't want to edit.

34
0:02:32.000 --> 0:02:36.000
I'm trying to sort of figure out like workflow improvements that allow me to edit.

35
0:02:36.000 --> 0:02:39.000
One of those is actually learning an editor. So I'm learning DaVinci Resolve.

36
0:02:39.000 --> 0:02:45.000
Everyone's like Learn Premiere and I'm just like, I don't want to be like tied to Adobe for the rest of my life.

37
0:02:45.000 --> 0:02:48.000
So I'm learning DaVinci because it's free.

38
0:02:48.000 --> 0:02:52.000
And if you want to use DaVinci in a professional setting, you can buy it.

39
0:02:52.000 --> 0:02:58.000
But the licensing is, you know, more affordable. The professional license just gives you more features, which is cool.

40
0:02:58.000 --> 0:03:02.000
So, you know, so I'm figuring out how to edit an OBS plugin,

41
0:03:02.000 --> 0:03:07.000
which will enable me to import markers that I create during my OBS recording.

42
0:03:07.000 --> 0:03:10.000
The reason why this is important is because when you're recording something,

43
0:03:10.000 --> 0:03:13.000
so like, you know, when you're recording a tutorial or whatever,

44
0:03:13.000 --> 0:03:21.000
I might know when an outtake occurs or where a particular item or marker or whatever occurs.

45
0:03:21.000 --> 0:03:24.000
And I've hooked it up via OBS and some edits to a plugin.

46
0:03:24.000 --> 0:03:28.000
I can push a key on my stream deck or I'll hook it up, I don't know, in Neo somehow.

47
0:03:28.000 --> 0:03:35.000
And that'll put a marker into like a separate file that I can then import into my video editor and line those up really, really cool.

48
0:03:35.000 --> 0:03:41.000
And that allows me to sort of look at the recording in a way that is faster to edit, I guess.

49
0:03:41.000 --> 0:03:44.000
I had a picture somewhere. Oh, we have a question as well.

50
0:03:44.000 --> 0:03:46.000
Let me just get that picture and then we'll get right to it.

51
0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:49.000
Ah, yes, you will. Excuse me. That one was my picture, this one.

52
0:03:49.000 --> 0:03:53.000
Here it is. Yeah. So you can see here the highlighted parts of the video.

53
0:03:53.000 --> 0:03:56.000
This is just a test recording, but allow me to basically be like, oh, yeah, that's where I made a mistake.

54
0:03:56.000 --> 0:04:00.000
I can edit around that, make it a lot easier. There's like markers at the top there.

55
0:04:00.000 --> 0:04:02.000
Importing them directly from Resolve is cool.

56
0:04:02.000 --> 0:04:07.000
Ramp comments that says the role of Resolve isn't a subscription, it's a one-time purchase. Hell yeah, that's cool.

57
0:04:07.000 --> 0:04:10.000
I'm kind of like perturbed by the like the subscription thing.

58
0:04:10.000 --> 0:04:14.000
Like I'm going through like all the subscriptions I have and kind of canceling some.

59
0:04:14.000 --> 0:04:19.000
A good example being like the video providers, right, you know, Hulu, Netflix, et cetera.

60
0:04:19.000 --> 0:04:23.000
I analyze how much I watch of all of them and then I cancel the ones I'm not using.

61
0:04:23.000 --> 0:04:31.000
And if like a new show comes out, I will pay for a month for one of them to watch that new show and then stop paying.

62
0:04:31.000 --> 0:04:39.000
A good example being Apple TV. I went and I did Apple TV for like a month so I could watch Foundation, a really good show, and Severance, and then I cancelled it.

63
0:04:39.000 --> 0:04:41.000
Because I'm like, that's all I was there for.

64
0:04:41.000 --> 0:04:43.000
All right, we've got some questions, which I mentioned.

65
0:04:43.000 --> 0:04:46.000
So Jolt says, will there eventually be a fire badge for all accounts made in 2021?

66
0:04:46.000 --> 0:04:50.000
I think so, yes. We'll take a look at doing that as soon as we can.

67
0:04:50.000 --> 0:04:57.000
And then Raghavas says, will there eventually be graphics settings and possibility to run Neos and older hardware?

68
0:04:57.000 --> 0:04:59.000
Yes. Two things that need to occur for that.

69
0:04:59.000 --> 0:05:01.000
So we're trying to redo our settings UI.

70
0:05:01.000 --> 0:05:06.000
That's one of the larger things that we're trying to work on, all things considered, as soon as we can.

71
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:10.000
That allows us to basically open up a lot more switches and dials and knobs, et cetera.

72
0:05:10.000 --> 0:05:20.000
And what's more than that, because some people misunderstand that as being easy, is it's going to allow us to have a framework which makes it easier to add additional settings.

73
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:25.000
So right now, if I wanted to add a setting, it would kind of be like a whole rigmarole.

74
0:05:25.000 --> 0:05:29.000
How do I add it? Oh, it's difficult, right, in terms of code functionality reasons.

75
0:05:29.000 --> 0:05:35.000
Then it'll add a framework, and it'll be like, all right, I want to do a setting that looks like this, that has these options, easy to do.

76
0:05:35.000 --> 0:05:44.000
And so that'll make things like graphical settings easier to do, as we're moving on to an engine that is not sort of shackled by Unity.

77
0:05:44.000 --> 0:05:47.000
We'll be able to do a lot more sort of settings and things there.

78
0:05:47.000 --> 0:05:54.000
Those will provide both user choice stuff, and they will also have performance benefits there.

79
0:05:54.000 --> 0:06:01.000
Additionally, we're looking into performance benefits across wherever we can that allow things to run on older hardware.

80
0:06:01.000 --> 0:06:08.000
One of the main problems of older hardware when it comes to VR is you have to render each image twice, once for each eye.

81
0:06:08.000 --> 0:06:11.000
I don't think many people think about that one.

82
0:06:11.000 --> 0:06:14.000
I don't know, you need to just think about it.

83
0:06:14.000 --> 0:06:16.000
It needs to render two cameras.

84
0:06:16.000 --> 0:06:20.000
Just imagine two very expensive cameras aimed at your knee as well.

85
0:06:20.000 --> 0:06:24.000
That's what VR is and doing, and that's why it can't be so intensive.

86
0:06:24.000 --> 0:06:27.000
So if you're running a game at 30 FPS, you're actually running a game at 60 FPS.

87
0:06:27.000 --> 0:06:28.000
Soon it adds up.

88
0:06:28.000 --> 0:06:33.000
Now, depending on the rendering technique and the new engine we're moving to will probably benefit from something there.

89
0:06:33.000 --> 0:06:35.000
I don't know, Ask Eens.

90
0:06:35.000 --> 0:06:42.000
You can save some resources by being like, yo dude, I'm about to do a VR render, so don't throw away everything.

91
0:06:42.000 --> 0:06:47.000
Because a lot of times, some data, I don't know enough about rendering about this, but sometimes data can be saved between frames.

92
0:06:47.000 --> 0:06:54.000
Because it's like, I'm about to render another frame, and this floating cube that's wood colored is still going to be there.

93
0:06:54.000 --> 0:06:59.000
So maybe don't dump the video memory about the wood texture or whatever.

94
0:06:59.000 --> 0:07:02.000
But yeah, more and more advances in that will also increase performance.

95
0:07:02.000 --> 0:07:05.000
Moving forwards, Lex talks about me editing videos.

96
0:07:05.000 --> 0:07:07.000
Yeah, sometimes it happens.

97
0:07:07.000 --> 0:07:12.000
I've kind of just got tired of starting and stopping the same video recording, because it just takes a lot of time.

98
0:07:12.000 --> 0:07:18.000
It takes a lot of time to find those videos. What I end up with is like 400 videos that are all like 2 seconds long.

99
0:07:18.000 --> 0:07:21.000
And I'm just like, I don't know what any of these are.

100
0:07:21.000 --> 0:07:29.000
With this setup, I can actually leave the same recording going, and I can just push a button to signal like, hey, this is a new take, hey, this is a new take.

101
0:07:29.000 --> 0:07:33.000
And then I can hop onto an editor and just cut bits out that I need.

102
0:07:33.000 --> 0:07:42.000
So not professional editing, you're not going to see dubstep intro like and subscribe stuff, but you might see some more like editing style things.

103
0:07:42.000 --> 0:07:44.000
I still don't want to make it happen.

104
0:07:44.000 --> 0:07:48.000
I know there's lots of YouTubers that take hilarious amounts of time to edit.

105
0:07:48.000 --> 0:07:53.000
I say hilarious because I just couldn't do it. I admire that they do it, I just look at it and I'm like, what?

106
0:07:53.000 --> 0:08:01.000
A good example here being a channel called Barry Lewis, made by Barry Lewis, who used to be just a complete rubbish cook.

107
0:08:01.000 --> 0:08:05.000
I decided to learn cooking via YouTube and now he's got a really big channel where he does recipes and stuff.

108
0:08:05.000 --> 0:08:16.000
And he has to like cook the recipe on camera, film like A-roll, film B-roll, film outtakes, you know, and then he has to go back to the video footage, edit it.

109
0:08:16.000 --> 0:08:23.000
And then he also has to, for each recipe he does, write up like a blog article on his blog, which also deals the text-based instructions of how to do that recipe.

110
0:08:23.000 --> 0:08:32.000
And so for each like tutorial, if you like, if you like format that back towards the sort of like what I do, he's doing like three different jobs.

111
0:08:32.000 --> 0:08:36.000
Like he's doing the recording, he's doing the editing, and he's doing the writing.

112
0:08:36.000 --> 0:08:41.000
And I'm just like that is such a lot of work, like for each video, really good videos because of that though.

113
0:08:41.000 --> 0:08:44.000
Moving towards to another question. So Eric asks,

114
0:08:44.000 --> 0:08:54.000
I have some trouble in trying to add images to the wiki. Articles specifically appear to be the backend server is not up with missions to call the image manipulation utility.

115
0:08:54.000 --> 0:08:57.000
You mentioned that there's an issue you couldn't fix. I was wondering what that means in regards to the wiki hosting solution.

116
0:08:57.000 --> 0:09:01.000
Are we using some creative service or does Neos own those servers?

117
0:09:01.000 --> 0:09:04.000
Let's try saying this carefully.

118
0:09:04.000 --> 0:09:08.000
The wiki is hosted on a host which is out of my control.

119
0:09:08.000 --> 0:09:17.000
The wiki is hosted on a host which is owned by or the account and the details and the authentication is owned by Carol.

120
0:09:17.000 --> 0:09:21.000
I want to move it somewhere that we all have access to.

121
0:09:21.000 --> 0:09:26.000
Fruits wanted to move it into the Azure cloud, would just like stand up a, you know, Azure VM to deal with it.

122
0:09:26.000 --> 0:09:29.000
Wraith wants to move it to their home server.

123
0:09:29.000 --> 0:09:37.000
As much as I admire home servers, like particularly for business applications, you shouldn't put like parts of a business on someone's home server,

124
0:09:37.000 --> 0:09:39.000
particularly if it's an employee.

125
0:09:39.000 --> 0:09:45.000
It may seem good at the time, but you end up there is like a contract that has no clauses to it.

126
0:09:45.000 --> 0:09:55.000
So an example that would be, okay, it is the year 2070 and Wraith no longer has power in their home because personal circumstances.

127
0:09:55.000 --> 0:09:58.000
Great. We've now lost our wiki, right?

128
0:09:58.000 --> 0:10:11.000
Whereas, you know, when you create a VM or a machine with a business, it's like here is a contract and the terms and like if we, you know, go out of business, we'll give you this much notice.

129
0:10:11.000 --> 0:10:13.000
Or if we go out of business, we'll provide like migration and stuff like that.

130
0:10:13.000 --> 0:10:17.000
But like with a home, there's not that like that paperwork doesn't happen.

131
0:10:17.000 --> 0:10:19.000
So I do want to move it to a better host.

132
0:10:19.000 --> 0:10:21.000
I can't really do that right now.

133
0:10:21.000 --> 0:10:25.000
I haven't seen that image uploading problem.

134
0:10:25.000 --> 0:10:28.000
Sometimes when I upload images, it like pretends it hasn't uploaded.

135
0:10:28.000 --> 0:10:30.000
So I have to upload it twice, but then it just appears.

136
0:10:30.000 --> 0:10:33.000
If that's broken recently, then it's a shame.

137
0:10:33.000 --> 0:10:35.000
We are trying to do our best.

138
0:10:35.000 --> 0:10:40.000
Wraith is doing something good, though, which is they are backing up the wiki regularly, like once a week or so.

139
0:10:40.000 --> 0:10:43.000
That's why I keep saying like, do edit stuff, do put stuff in there.

140
0:10:43.000 --> 0:10:44.000
We're still holding on to it.

141
0:10:44.000 --> 0:10:48.000
And whatever happens later, we'll make sure that we stand our backs on my sensible.

142
0:10:48.000 --> 0:10:51.000
This is all sort of resolved itself.

143
0:10:51.000 --> 0:10:56.000
Flex said that they think that the wiki is listed on a platform called SiteGround.

144
0:10:56.000 --> 0:10:57.000
It might be.

145
0:10:57.000 --> 0:10:59.000
I don't know.

146
0:10:59.000 --> 0:11:03.000
I would have to go ahead and poke around in my DMs a little bit.

147
0:11:03.000 --> 0:11:07.000
The Sirusi asks, are the domains under Carol's control?

148
0:11:07.000 --> 0:11:08.000
Yes.

149
0:11:08.000 --> 0:11:09.000
Yes.

150
0:11:09.000 --> 0:11:14.000
I'm not sure if the Cloudflare account is, but yes.

151
0:11:14.000 --> 0:11:16.000
We will sort things out.

152
0:11:16.000 --> 0:11:23.000
I hate how many of these office hours we've had where I'm basically like beating around the bush here.

153
0:11:23.000 --> 0:11:26.000
Like, if you're not sure what's going on, go ahead, read announcements.

154
0:11:26.000 --> 0:11:33.000
I try and keep it out of these office hours because like, hey, they're meant to be for me asking, answering questions about Neos, but I understand, you know, what's going on.

155
0:11:33.000 --> 0:11:38.000
We will figure it out when we're able to.

156
0:11:38.000 --> 0:11:48.000
Until we're able to, it would be in Carol's best interest to not fudge with our DNS too much. If he does, I will shake a cat at him or something.

157
0:11:48.000 --> 0:11:50.000
Yeah.

158
0:11:50.000 --> 0:11:52.000
I don't know if I...

159
0:11:52.000 --> 0:11:55.000
No, I won't tell you what we had.

160
0:11:55.000 --> 0:12:01.000
We had like a working name for like what the future might be.

161
0:12:01.000 --> 0:12:02.000
It's kind of comical.

162
0:12:02.000 --> 0:12:04.000
I won't tell you the sort of working name we had.

163
0:12:04.000 --> 0:12:05.000
Don't worry about it.

164
0:12:05.000 --> 0:12:07.000
It's not like definitive or anything like that.

165
0:12:07.000 --> 0:12:16.000
It's basically just like when we refer to the future, the Neos team now have sort of like a name that means like, oh, okay, you're talking about the future.

166
0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:19.000
It's the same thing as talking like, oh, we're talking about VRChat or we're talking about Neos.

167
0:12:19.000 --> 0:12:23.000
It's like when we say, hey, we're talking about Neos, we're usually talking about today.

168
0:12:23.000 --> 0:12:29.000
And when we use this comical phrasing, we are talking about the future after this mess has cleared up.

169
0:12:29.000 --> 0:12:32.000
It might still be called Neos. We don't know right now is what I'm saying.

170
0:12:32.000 --> 0:12:34.000
That's why I'm not talking about it too much.

171
0:12:34.000 --> 0:12:36.000
But it is comical.

172
0:12:36.000 --> 0:12:40.000
And I don't think it would name like if we had to change the Neos name, we would not name it this.

173
0:12:40.000 --> 0:12:43.000
It's just a like conversational matter.

174
0:12:43.000 --> 0:12:44.000
Lex says buy all the domains.

175
0:12:44.000 --> 0:12:46.000
Yeah, I keep buying domains and then not using them.

176
0:12:46.000 --> 0:12:48.000
So it's really annoying.

177
0:12:48.000 --> 0:12:53.000
Like I have a domain I need, of course, because it runs my email that uses an old screen name I used to use.

178
0:12:53.000 --> 0:12:57.000
And then I have my domain, my current screen name.

179
0:12:57.000 --> 0:13:02.000
And then I have a couple of others I just keep because like I want to.

180
0:13:02.000 --> 0:13:05.000
But they cost like what, like five dollars a month or whatever.

181
0:13:05.000 --> 0:13:10.000
Like I own cheese based games for a mix related meme.

182
0:13:10.000 --> 0:13:13.000
And it got a lot of hits back in the mix of days.

183
0:13:13.000 --> 0:13:17.000
And I just like keep accidentally accidentally renewing it.

184
0:13:17.000 --> 0:13:19.000
It's like one of those like weird decisions, right?

185
0:13:19.000 --> 0:13:26.000
If it's a monthly service that you pay for, you notice it like every month, like ticking away your bank balance.

186
0:13:26.000 --> 0:13:29.000
But when it's a domain name, it's like every year.

187
0:13:29.000 --> 0:13:34.000
Right. You're just like, oh, shit, I forgot to cancel that domain registration.

188
0:13:34.000 --> 0:13:37.000
I've got another year of cheese based games.

189
0:13:37.000 --> 0:13:39.000
Like it's difficult to remember.

190
0:13:39.000 --> 0:13:44.000
The other thing is like I am allergic to having like servers in the cloud when it comes to personal projects.

191
0:13:44.000 --> 0:13:46.000
All my personal projects are just like websites, right?

192
0:13:46.000 --> 0:13:48.000
They're static. They don't need databases.

193
0:13:48.000 --> 0:13:52.000
And so all of these are like in a single like not issue.

194
0:13:52.000 --> 0:13:57.000
AWS like S3 bucket and cost like, I don't know, a dollar every three months or something.

195
0:13:57.000 --> 0:13:58.000
It's ridiculously cheap.

196
0:13:58.000 --> 0:14:03.000
If you're interested in CSS or anything like that on the Web technologies, etc.

197
0:14:03.000 --> 0:14:10.000
Go ahead and take a look at the CSS that we have for that spiral animation that exists on cheese based games.

198
0:14:10.000 --> 0:14:13.000
It took took a lot of maths.

199
0:14:13.000 --> 0:14:17.000
I believe a friend actually kind of helped me with it eventually.

200
0:14:17.000 --> 0:14:19.000
It's it's like it's a lot.

201
0:14:19.000 --> 0:14:21.000
All right. We're out of questions.

202
0:14:21.000 --> 0:14:24.000
I could go ahead and talk about cheese based games all day.

203
0:14:24.000 --> 0:14:27.000
But if you have any further questions, please do let me know.

204
0:14:27.000 --> 0:14:30.000
Otherwise, we'll sit here for the remaining few minutes.

205
0:14:30.000 --> 0:14:35.000
Of course, keep those questions coming and I'll answer them when they come in.

206
0:14:35.000 --> 0:14:37.000
That's a good question. Thank you.

207
0:14:37.000 --> 0:14:43.000
So a robust asks, it's maybe only C sharp or does it include other programming languages?

208
0:14:43.000 --> 0:14:45.000
Includes a lot of programming languages.

209
0:14:45.000 --> 0:14:49.000
You'll find this a lot as well in just like any project, right?

210
0:14:49.000 --> 0:14:51.000
You're like, oh, yeah, it's got to be pure C sharp.

211
0:14:51.000 --> 0:14:56.000
It can't be in a language like other languages are like creep in and be like a little bit weird about it.

212
0:14:56.000 --> 0:15:05.000
So while we are, you know, mostly C sharp, we do have a little bit of C somewhere as well in some parts of the engine, et cetera.

213
0:15:05.000 --> 0:15:08.000
There is a like intermediary language. I always forget its name.

214
0:15:08.000 --> 0:15:14.000
I have it written down in my notes somewhere, but we do a lot of code compilation and that uses a templating language.

215
0:15:14.000 --> 0:15:18.000
What we basically have is like, for example, the mass notes, the mass knows automatically generated.

216
0:15:18.000 --> 0:15:24.000
There's no need to write like thousands of classes to be like, oh, yes, this is the add two numbers float.

217
0:15:24.000 --> 0:15:26.000
Add two numbers double, add two numbers int.

218
0:15:26.000 --> 0:15:30.000
We have templating languages that will generate those nodes every time they change.

219
0:15:30.000 --> 0:15:37.000
I mess with them all the time, which causes like 10,000 lines to change in a pull request.

220
0:15:37.000 --> 0:15:42.000
But like it's actually just like two because I've changed the templating language a little bit.

221
0:15:42.000 --> 0:15:48.000
And then there are like scripts everywhere that are just like, you know, sometimes I think there's like a Python file somewhere.

222
0:15:48.000 --> 0:15:50.000
You know, it. Yeah.

223
0:15:50.000 --> 0:15:56.000
Eric says Perl always end up somewhere. Perl hasn't ended up somewhere yet, but like stuff happens.

224
0:15:56.000 --> 0:16:02.000
I see languages as like a tool and sometimes the language which the entire engine is written in, which is mostly C sharp.

225
0:16:02.000 --> 0:16:08.000
I will give you that is mostly C sharp just like isn't suitable or needs to do things that aren't available.

226
0:16:08.000 --> 0:16:12.000
We also do a lot of and I haven't actually looked at where it occurs.

227
0:16:12.000 --> 0:16:20.000
It's like really like there's like, you know, like iceberg videos where they're like, oh, let's look at the Disney Park iceberg and right at the bottom.

228
0:16:20.000 --> 0:16:24.000
It's like child labor or something. You know, it's crazy like stuff like that.

229
0:16:24.000 --> 0:16:30.000
It's never proven. They never cite their sources. They're just like, let's look at the iceberg of this fandom.

230
0:16:30.000 --> 0:16:33.000
Let's look at the Neo source code iceberg.

231
0:16:33.000 --> 0:16:43.000
And then right at the bottom is this stuff which basically takes the compiled code that we produce and it modifies that compiled code to make it a little bit more optimized.

232
0:16:43.000 --> 0:16:48.000
That takes the intermediary language and patches it a little bit to make it even more optimized.

233
0:16:48.000 --> 0:16:55.000
That's where you're like, I know that you're like a compiler C sharp and like you're cool and you've compiled my code.

234
0:16:55.000 --> 0:17:02.000
But trust me, if I just make this like I.L. just a little bit different, it'll be like 20 times better in terms of performance.

235
0:17:02.000 --> 0:17:07.000
And they're like, OK, go for it. It's it's strange for those who are unaware of how computers work.

236
0:17:07.000 --> 0:17:12.000
I really do encourage you just a little bit is go write an assembly program. You'll go mental.

237
0:17:12.000 --> 0:17:16.000
You will go absolutely mental. It's terrible. Like it is so bad.

238
0:17:16.000 --> 0:17:21.000
Like go look up a tutorial, do an assembly program, multiply two numbers together.

239
0:17:21.000 --> 0:17:25.000
Have fun. You only have to do that and like don't learn it enough to use it on a daily basis.

240
0:17:25.000 --> 0:17:28.000
Just learn it enough to do that. Like multiply two numbers together.

241
0:17:28.000 --> 0:17:38.000
You will come out like learning so much about how C sharp C or languages like that are so cool compared to what people had to program in.

242
0:17:38.000 --> 0:17:43.000
And then understand that all of those languages that exist compile down to that kind of stuff.

243
0:17:43.000 --> 0:17:54.000
You have a new appreciation, like every time you write a line of code, you're like somewhere this is being compiled down to something similar to assembly, like similar and like the way it operates.

244
0:17:54.000 --> 0:18:04.000
And then if you want to like learn more, look up how square roots work, because square roots are prohibitively expensive in in programming.

245
0:18:04.000 --> 0:18:10.000
And back in the sort of older days of computing, the quake engine came up with a really quick way to do it.

246
0:18:10.000 --> 0:18:14.000
And now everyone pretty much does that. I think there's some more like ways of doing it.

247
0:18:14.000 --> 0:18:20.000
But like at some point, you know, that it came out and people like, wow, this is cool.

248
0:18:20.000 --> 0:18:25.000
Same thing is like, you know, sorting and cryptography, right? So sorting algorithms are pretty much stable right now.

249
0:18:25.000 --> 0:18:30.000
That's when you like have, you know, a list of numbers in out of order and you want to put them in order.

250
0:18:30.000 --> 0:18:35.000
There are, you know, in the early days of computing, people coming up with new sorting algorithms every sort of few years.

251
0:18:35.000 --> 0:18:41.000
And they're like, this one is 20 percent better. This one's 30 percent better. And now you were kind of static, right?

252
0:18:41.000 --> 0:18:47.000
Some new ones sometimes come out, but like we're pretty much static. Like there's there's only like a few ways to do it.

253
0:18:47.000 --> 0:18:51.000
They're known. Same with cryptography. We do sometimes come up with new cryptographic ones.

254
0:18:51.000 --> 0:18:55.000
But the problem with like new cryptographic algorithms is they need to be proven.

255
0:18:55.000 --> 0:19:04.000
It's like, would you use the one that is proven and used by like many military establishments or this new one which a hipster wrote on the Internet?

256
0:19:04.000 --> 0:19:11.000
And it's like you're going to use the one that the military is using basically. But yeah, those those early days of computing must have been fun.

257
0:19:11.000 --> 0:19:17.000
Aragabass has another question, which is, what does one need to do to join the newest development team? Is there a form to fill out something?

258
0:19:17.000 --> 0:19:24.000
We are currently not allowing anyone to join the team currently due to hashtag announcements and various other things like that.

259
0:19:24.000 --> 0:19:28.000
When that changes, we will let you know via hashtag announcements.

260
0:19:28.000 --> 0:19:34.000
It's almost like a meme, you know, hashtag announcements. It's like this sort of like big boss or something at the end of a level.

261
0:19:34.000 --> 0:19:37.000
In the last few minutes we got, I guess I always ask you guys a question.

262
0:19:37.000 --> 0:19:42.000
If you want to see any additional tutorials or stuff from me, information, whatever you want to see, let me know.

263
0:19:42.000 --> 0:19:46.000
If you want to see a new tutorial on some obscure part of Neos, let me know.

264
0:19:46.000 --> 0:19:49.000
If you want to see, I don't know, if you want to know anything, let me know.

265
0:19:49.000 --> 0:19:53.000
I'm thinking about ways to sort of expand the stuff that I do.

266
0:19:53.000 --> 0:19:57.000
I should have a lot more time coming up soon as well. So, you know, whatever you want to see.

267
0:19:57.000 --> 0:20:03.000
I think you're doing some streaming as well. But like, you know, it's never clear how many people would watch and then what I would do.

268
0:20:03.000 --> 0:20:13.000
So who knows. Eric's talking about a professor who was very, like, very pedantic, I guess, about what they're accepting as a submission to their programming course.

269
0:20:13.000 --> 0:20:20.000
I had that when I did a SQL unit at university. It was Microsoft SQL.

270
0:20:20.000 --> 0:20:25.000
And so, you know, the university had Microsoft SQL servers that you could log into for your assignment and do.

271
0:20:25.000 --> 0:20:34.000
And I was penalized heavily because my SQL and the data, which I put into my SQL database, wasn't capitalized.

272
0:20:34.000 --> 0:20:46.000
Like they wanted, you know, not only did they want capitalized SQL queries, they wanted the names of the user to also be capitalized.

273
0:20:46.000 --> 0:20:48.000
They wanted all data to be capitalized.

274
0:20:48.000 --> 0:20:57.000
And it's just like, cool, you do know you can write SQL in lowercase and that you can put data into a database in the case it comes to you in?

275
0:20:57.000 --> 0:21:00.000
And he'll go, yeah, you're not meant to do it that way.

276
0:21:00.000 --> 0:21:05.000
You're meant to have it all capital, all our, you're not meant to have it, and I'm like, but why?

277
0:21:05.000 --> 0:21:07.000
And he goes, it's just the way it's done.

278
0:21:07.000 --> 0:21:11.000
I'm like, well, I don't write SQL in capital letters. I'm sorry, I don't.

279
0:21:11.000 --> 0:21:15.000
And he's like, why not? I'm like, because you don't need to. You've never needed to.

280
0:21:15.000 --> 0:21:18.000
It's like, I don't like capitalized SQL queries.

281
0:21:18.000 --> 0:21:20.000
It's just like, why? You don't need to.

282
0:21:20.000 --> 0:21:23.000
I can read it a lot better when it's in lowercase for some reason.

283
0:21:23.000 --> 0:21:24.000
I don't know. Maybe I'm weird.

284
0:21:24.000 --> 0:21:30.000
Plus, in this day and age, you kind of really shouldn't be using SQL providers.

285
0:21:30.000 --> 0:21:32.000
There are some that are really good if they're configured correctly.

286
0:21:32.000 --> 0:21:37.000
But if you're like using for like a hobby project or something, just use one of the cloud databases.

287
0:21:37.000 --> 0:21:43.000
Like, AWS has one, Cloudflare has one, Google Cloud has one, Azure has one.

288
0:21:43.000 --> 0:21:46.000
There's a bunch of like third-party providers that have a bunch as well.

289
0:21:46.000 --> 0:21:49.000
Like, just use those. They're a lot better.

290
0:21:49.000 --> 0:21:50.000
I'm looking to GraphQL.

291
0:21:50.000 --> 0:21:52.000
Oh, we have another question. Great.

292
0:21:52.000 --> 0:21:58.000
So, Lex says, Unreal at Five has a move to switch to double precision coordinates.

293
0:21:58.000 --> 0:22:06.000
Would Neos ever consider doing something similar to this to increase precision distance for walls and coordinate spaces?

294
0:22:06.000 --> 0:22:11.000
I was reading some notes yesterday from Fruits where he's talking about trying to figure out how to do that

295
0:22:11.000 --> 0:22:16.000
in a slightly different way that would also increase performance.

296
0:22:16.000 --> 0:22:22.000
I can't remember the exact specifics they were talking about, but the word that's coming to mind right now is sort of like honeycomb,

297
0:22:22.000 --> 0:22:28.000
where like there are different parts of the world sort of overlaid on top of each other so the precision problem doesn't incur.

298
0:22:28.000 --> 0:22:35.000
To make you aware of that, basically the coordinate system that we use has a float for precision.

299
0:22:35.000 --> 0:22:39.000
And if you go too far out, you will see weird stuff happening.

300
0:22:39.000 --> 0:22:44.000
You'll start vibrating and then you'll eventually respawn because the engine's just hard-coded to do that.

301
0:22:44.000 --> 0:22:48.000
The same thing occurs if you get too small or you get too big. The engine just freaks out.

302
0:22:48.000 --> 0:22:53.000
That technically isn't a problem or bug of the engine. It's a bug with mathematics.

303
0:22:53.000 --> 0:22:58.000
But the engine can be changed, like Unreal Five has done, to provide a double precision option,

304
0:22:58.000 --> 0:23:02.000
which will double the volume that you can go through.

305
0:23:02.000 --> 0:23:05.000
For anyone who's confused by that, I want you to think about the Far Lands,

306
0:23:05.000 --> 0:23:09.000
which was a Minecraft phenomenon that occurred in earlier versions of Minecraft,

307
0:23:09.000 --> 0:23:15.000
where when the maths just got weird, the world generation got weird.

308
0:23:15.000 --> 0:23:21.000
I don't know if they've reached it yet. I check in like every couple of years because I think that's cool.

309
0:23:21.000 --> 0:23:27.000
There is a YouTuber who's trying to reach the Far Lands. The Far Lands have long since been patched out of Minecraft,

310
0:23:27.000 --> 0:23:32.000
but he's on a build where it still occurs and he's just walking in a straight line trying to get the Far Lands

311
0:23:32.000 --> 0:23:36.000
and everyone's subscribed to him and I'm just like, cool, it's strange.

312
0:23:36.000 --> 0:23:39.000
Minecraft content creation is a very strange way.

313
0:23:39.000 --> 0:23:42.000
Which reminds me, has anyone played the Minecraft Bedrock Edition recently?

314
0:23:42.000 --> 0:23:49.000
They had a marketplace and an avatar builder and you can buy hats and stuff.

315
0:23:49.000 --> 0:23:58.000
Before it was kind of like all skins had to be very creative because there was no way to escape the confines of the 3D space of your Minecraft avatar.

316
0:23:58.000 --> 0:24:04.000
There was the secondary layer that had a hat, which had some 3D to it,

317
0:24:04.000 --> 0:24:10.000
but now with this marketplace they've completely escaped the 3D bounds of the Minecraft character.

318
0:24:10.000 --> 0:24:16.000
You can have wings, a huge big hat, hair, and it's all 3D and stuff like that.

319
0:24:16.000 --> 0:24:24.000
It reminds me of Trove or Blockland? I don't remember. I've got it in my head, I don't know what it's called.

320
0:24:24.000 --> 0:24:30.000
We are getting off topic, but we're at the end of the session, plus it's prime time, I can do what I want.

321
0:24:30.000 --> 0:24:34.000
If there's no questions I'm going to rant about cheese for a bit, it's totally cool.

322
0:24:34.000 --> 0:24:40.000
With that we are at 31 minutes past. Yeah, the topic was kind of strange.

323
0:24:40.000 --> 0:24:43.000
We got to Minecraft because we were talking about floating point precision.

324
0:24:43.000 --> 0:24:48.000
I did see Froppy by the way, I did see you asking for that vague tutorial, I'm probably going to get that sorted.

325
0:24:48.000 --> 0:24:59.000
I'm reconfiguring my microphone right now, I don't like anything that's going on right now with the audio setup I've got going, so I'm taking a look at that.

326
0:24:59.000 --> 0:25:05.000
You know one of the worst things you can do as a content creator is to buy those black acoustic phone things and just stick them all over your wall.

327
0:25:05.000 --> 0:25:09.000
I know everyone does it, but don't.

328
0:25:09.000 --> 0:25:13.000
But I've got some coming, some small amounts coming.

329
0:25:13.000 --> 0:25:28.000
GraphQL does look like magic, lots of older people in the industry will say that GraphQL is insecure or provides problems.

330
0:25:28.000 --> 0:25:33.000
And the reason behind that is because it flips the sort of control in some cases.

331
0:25:33.000 --> 0:25:42.000
You can put control there, and the other reason is because it constructs dynamic data based on the query that you GraphQL.

332
0:25:42.000 --> 0:25:46.000
But I think it's cool, and if you're using the right engine that does GraphQL for you, it's not a problem.

333
0:25:46.000 --> 0:25:49.000
You can have security, you can have caching, it's performant.

334
0:25:49.000 --> 0:25:51.000
People are just sort of scared of change.

335
0:25:51.000 --> 0:25:56.000
I would love if the next thing I worked on could be GraphQL.

336
0:25:56.000 --> 0:25:59.000
Neos uses Cosmos DB, which is like, I'll accept.

337
0:25:59.000 --> 0:26:03.000
I hope I don't have to work anywhere that uses SQL these days.

338
0:26:03.000 --> 0:26:06.000
All of the cloud-based databases are cool.

339
0:26:06.000 --> 0:26:10.000
Okay, we have some questions. I know I did say hey, we're almost at the end here.

340
0:26:10.000 --> 0:26:13.000
Urgebas talks about, hey, what is GraphQL?

341
0:26:13.000 --> 0:26:16.000
Honestly, you're going to have to just go look it up.

342
0:26:16.000 --> 0:26:26.000
I could talk about it, but at that point we'll be like, hey, welcome to primetime about the computer software industry, rather than, hey, primetime about Neos.

343
0:26:26.000 --> 0:26:30.000
Anyway, Lex says, what parts of Neos were affected by the Cloudflare issues?

344
0:26:30.000 --> 0:26:41.000
The Cloudflare basically acts as a middleman, or middleperson, sorry, between you and the Neos services, and it saves us some bandwidth.

345
0:26:41.000 --> 0:26:45.000
Every time there's a request that goes to our services, we sort of pay.

346
0:26:45.000 --> 0:26:48.000
It's not like, hey, a dollar per request, but it adds up.

347
0:26:48.000 --> 0:26:51.000
A thousand requests might be a dollar, whatever, it doesn't matter.

348
0:26:51.000 --> 0:26:54.000
And then Cloudflare kind of offsets a little bit of that.

349
0:26:54.000 --> 0:27:01.000
With Cloudflare being down, only in certain regions, it meant that you couldn't get to our services.

350
0:27:01.000 --> 0:27:05.000
Anything that talked to our services could have failed.

351
0:27:05.000 --> 0:27:11.000
So getting your list of contacts that were online, that would talk via Cloudflare and might fail.

352
0:27:11.000 --> 0:27:16.000
Getting a list of items in your inventory, that goes through Cloudflare and might fail.

353
0:27:16.000 --> 0:27:21.000
The important thing to remember when that particular issue comes up, and that's what actually stayed in the announcement, is that all the data is secure.

354
0:27:21.000 --> 0:27:26.000
It's not like we've deleted any data, lost any data, you just can't get the data.

355
0:27:26.000 --> 0:27:31.000
So it's a bit like waiting for that package in the mail, like waiting for your Steam Deck, right?

356
0:27:31.000 --> 0:27:36.000
You've been waiting months for your Steam Deck, it's not here, that's exactly what's happening when Cloudflare's done.

357
0:27:36.000 --> 0:27:44.000
You know exactly where the data is, you know there's a Steam Deck in some warehouse somewhere, because it exists, it just hasn't been shipped to you.

358
0:27:44.000 --> 0:27:50.000
Syncing's another one, right, because syncing sends data to us, and if it can't go through the Cloudflare layer, it's going to get stuck.

359
0:27:50.000 --> 0:28:00.000
Seeing as I had a little bit of time whilst I was answering that question, I looked up GraphQL's website, because I forgot if it was an org or whatever, it turns out it is an org, so there's a website for you.

360
0:28:00.000 --> 0:28:03.000
One thing that was not affected by Cloudflare is if you were in a session.

361
0:28:03.000 --> 0:28:11.000
You might not be able to get to a session in some cases, but if you were already in a session, you'd be fine.

362
0:28:11.000 --> 0:28:22.000
Easton says it would be useful if you didn't add everyone with that Cloudflare announcement. I don't do add everyones with service announcements, because if you know to read announcements, you might be, you know, you're looking.

363
0:28:22.000 --> 0:28:29.000
I see server outages as things you should look at, right? There's push communication, and then there's pull communication.

364
0:28:29.000 --> 0:28:38.000
I see service outages as a pull communication. It's fine if it's like email, or it's in the game, Wraith would actually send out an alert in game, that's fine.

365
0:28:38.000 --> 0:28:47.000
But for Discord, it would just be weird, right? Like, add everyone for two hours, something was a problem. I don't know, it just feels weird.

366
0:28:47.000 --> 0:28:53.000
Yeah, if you want to know why it's happening, you'll find out. If it doesn't affect you, I've just pinged you for no reason.

367
0:28:53.000 --> 0:29:07.000
It is like, it's weird based on the situation. Like if it was a more major outage, I would have done it, but this one was like, some people might have an issue with this tiny portion of like, you know, like, operation.

368
0:29:07.000 --> 0:29:17.000
And it's like, well, I don't really want everyone for that. If it was like, Neo servers are on fire, you need to do something immediately, or your avatar is going to be deleted, of course I would have everyone.

369
0:29:17.000 --> 0:29:26.000
It also lets you set it up, right, so you could set up your Discord announcements to like, ping you on any message announcements, which is what I recommend, but I understand if people don't.

370
0:29:26.000 --> 0:29:39.000
Anyway, we are now at 1637. I'm going to go ahead and say that and cut it. If you have any further questions, feel free to direct message me. If you have any ideas, tutorials, whatever you want to say, just like, spam me in DM.

371
0:29:39.000 --> 0:29:49.000
I will answer Tangle's question because they entered it before I stopped speaking, so I will answer it. This is the last question. Kip, I see you, no questions, Kip. No.

372
0:29:49.000 --> 0:30:00.000
You can type though, I'm not saying don't type, I'm not answering you, I'm just saying I won't answer it. DM me or whatever, or you can type it and I'll answer via text after this, anyway.

373
0:30:00.000 --> 0:30:11.000
So Tangle asks, speaking of avatars deleted, is there a way to have outside servers for storage? Yes, there is one way. Anything that you take to your local home and place inside your local home is saved to your computer.

374
0:30:11.000 --> 0:30:20.000
In that case though, do not clear, delete, reinstall, Neos without thinking about that, without thinking about that.

375
0:30:20.000 --> 0:30:28.000
So I see a lot of people, like something goes wrong with Neos and their first response is, I'm going to delete my local cache and database.

376
0:30:28.000 --> 0:30:39.000
They're just like, cool, okay, that won't fix it, but woohoo, woohoo, good, good job. You've just deleted everything that was in your local home.

377
0:30:39.000 --> 0:30:45.000
There was actually a point in Neos where the cloud services didn't exist for storage and everyone just had to save stuff in their home.

378
0:30:45.000 --> 0:30:53.000
There was also a point in Neos where there were no inventories, like if you wanted to save something, you had to take it to your local home and just leave it there, like in a pile.

379
0:30:53.000 --> 0:31:01.000
People had piles of stuff. If you do launch a new world and you go to Scratch Space, the whole reason Scratch Space existed is because there was no inventory.

380
0:31:01.000 --> 0:31:08.000
So if you go to Scratch Space, you'll see each tool lined up. The reason that it existed, there was no inventory. You just had to go to Scratch Space and pick it up off the floor.

381
0:31:08.000 --> 0:31:16.000
And if someone gave you something cool that you wanted to hang around, you had to take it to your cloud home or your local home when the cloud homes didn't exist and leave it there.

382
0:31:16.000 --> 0:31:20.000
I'm not answering other questions, sorry, we're going to cut it now before it's too late.

383
0:31:20.000 --> 0:31:27.000
If it's in text, I'll answer it in text in just a moment after I cut the recording. I do apologize, I just have to cut the line at some point.

384
0:31:27.000 --> 0:31:29.000
We'll be here forever.

385
0:31:29.000 --> 0:31:39.000
So I will see you guys next time. Bye bye.
