0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.360
Okay, well we are now going to get started. It is 4 p.m. so welcome to

2
0:00:04.360 --> 0:00:08.440
office hours. This is office hours of me, Probable Prime. I'm a member of the NEOS team and I'm

3
0:00:08.440 --> 0:00:11.360
gonna answer your questions. As a reminder, which I've been saying like every couple

4
0:00:11.360 --> 0:00:14.240
of seconds before this, if you have questions please drop them in the office

5
0:00:14.240 --> 0:00:16.560
hours chat that's two above the one that you're currently in the community

6
0:00:16.560 --> 0:00:21.080
meetings chat and I'll get to them in the order that they appear and I'll answer them. Let's go ahead

7
0:00:21.080 --> 0:00:24.560
and take a look. So we have a question from Light Lotus who says what is

8
0:00:24.560 --> 0:00:27.160
happening with NEOS? Why has nothing been said about the state of leadership? It

9
0:00:27.160 --> 0:00:31.120
has. If you check announcements you'll see the updated information there. If

10
0:00:31.120 --> 0:00:33.920
there's any additional information we'll share it in announcements. You'll get

11
0:00:33.920 --> 0:00:37.120
tidbits information randomly from from various members of the team when they

12
0:00:37.120 --> 0:00:41.560
answer various questions but like no news doesn't mean nothing's happening it

13
0:00:41.560 --> 0:00:45.000
just means that there's no news. There's like there's a difference there right so

14
0:00:45.000 --> 0:00:49.800
we can't say nothing's happening and we can't say nothing's not happening we

15
0:00:49.800 --> 0:00:54.400
just we can't tell you like anything until we can tell you stuff like so no

16
0:00:54.400 --> 0:00:58.720
news means wait for more news. Thumbs up. Cool.

17
0:00:58.720 --> 0:01:02.160
Moving on ones to Duff's question. Duff says with the huge influx of VLC players

18
0:01:02.160 --> 0:01:05.760
migrating over to NEOS what the scene what are the what are some of the key

19
0:01:05.760 --> 0:01:08.520
things we should be teaching new players that the team and all the community

20
0:01:08.520 --> 0:01:13.080
members would like to emphasize on? I personally and I can't enforce this of

21
0:01:13.080 --> 0:01:15.720
course because it's not on any guidelines it's not me speaking as an

22
0:01:15.720 --> 0:01:20.600
official capacity is for you to be considerate. There's a lot of sort of you

23
0:01:20.600 --> 0:01:26.560
know cool stuff that you can do inside Neos but being considerate is incredibly

24
0:01:26.560 --> 0:01:31.360
important. I have a list of ways that you can be considerate on a personal page on

25
0:01:31.360 --> 0:01:36.080
the Neos Wiki once again this is not like mandated this is not like do this

26
0:01:36.080 --> 0:01:40.000
or you will die this is just my personal opinion about how you can be considerate.

27
0:01:40.000 --> 0:01:45.880
There's also the social videos that exist in my social VR playlist which

28
0:01:45.880 --> 0:01:50.800
I'll go ahead and link as well. As Shifty says in the comments consent is super

29
0:01:50.800 --> 0:01:55.000
important there are other social issues which are very important consent being a

30
0:01:55.000 --> 0:01:59.680
very very large one in that ground. So they would take a look at the social

31
0:01:59.680 --> 0:02:03.160
videos there and the social videos we have Reading the Room which is about

32
0:02:03.160 --> 0:02:06.840
basically when you join a Neo session it might be unclear what's happening in

33
0:02:06.840 --> 0:02:10.240
that Neo session you just take like a couple of seconds you know figure out

34
0:02:10.240 --> 0:02:13.760
what's happening what type of session is this what type of users are in this

35
0:02:13.760 --> 0:02:20.520
session how best can my existence my energy influence this session. In some

36
0:02:20.520 --> 0:02:23.520
cases the answer is not at all in which case you can just leave there's nothing

37
0:02:23.520 --> 0:02:26.720
bad about that you're just like hey it's the wrong session happens all the time

38
0:02:26.720 --> 0:02:32.120
in over in VRC right you join the 20th black cat of the day to see who's in the

39
0:02:32.120 --> 0:02:35.520
black cat and you're just like well this group are over here listening to

40
0:02:35.520 --> 0:02:38.340
terrible rap music in the corner in front of a mirror I don't think this is

41
0:02:38.340 --> 0:02:41.840
the world for me and you go on to the next black cat that's you know exactly

42
0:02:41.840 --> 0:02:46.080
the same thing happening over here on all Neos if the if the session isn't

43
0:02:46.080 --> 0:02:50.840
suitable you just just move on VRC for me is like vibe hunting a little bit

44
0:02:50.840 --> 0:02:54.440
different in Neos because there's you know so much more you can do but in VRC

45
0:02:54.440 --> 0:02:57.840
I mostly vibe hunt I'm like I'm looking for a particular vibe usually just chill

46
0:02:57.840 --> 0:03:03.520
and not terrible rap music yeah there's also the myths list actually I do want

47
0:03:03.520 --> 0:03:08.800
to cover that one so misinformation is rampant and so if someone comes up to

48
0:03:08.800 --> 0:03:13.120
you and they say something on the lines of I heard this or he said this or she

49
0:03:13.120 --> 0:03:19.400
said that or I heard this or the dev said this no they're doing this etc do

50
0:03:19.400 --> 0:03:23.720
check that miss list it's not exhaustive there are other ones there those are

51
0:03:23.720 --> 0:03:27.480
just the myths that like they they ground my gears on that day that I wrote

52
0:03:27.480 --> 0:03:31.320
that page at the wiki is a community project feel free to add more myths to

53
0:03:31.320 --> 0:03:36.240
that page additionally I have a screenshot from our friends and I say

54
0:03:36.240 --> 0:03:40.920
that because we should be working together as you know social metaverses I

55
0:03:40.920 --> 0:03:46.480
have a screenshot of a message from the VR chat team which I just want to like

56
0:03:46.480 --> 0:03:50.520
signal boost here in a way that I know out it's my office hours which is like

57
0:03:50.520 --> 0:03:56.200
hey do what you can to combat misinformation as well like a lot of

58
0:03:56.200 --> 0:04:01.020
sessions I was in I would say 20 to 30 percent there were some people in the

59
0:04:01.020 --> 0:04:04.520
corners or sometimes just blatantly talking about it they're like oh yeah

60
0:04:04.520 --> 0:04:08.480
like you know VR just stealing credit card information now and it's like well

61
0:04:08.480 --> 0:04:12.440
what is the like what is the source of your information like oh you heard it

62
0:04:12.440 --> 0:04:15.080
from a friend okay where did they hear it from Oh friend and you trace it all

63
0:04:15.080 --> 0:04:18.000
the way back and it's just like they read an offhand comment somewhere that

64
0:04:18.000 --> 0:04:20.480
doesn't make sense like if you go direct to the source you'll get more information

65
0:04:20.480 --> 0:04:25.920
there so there we go moving forwards let's take a look at more questions

66
0:04:25.920 --> 0:04:30.440
Jin says question is anyone team set up a hardware wallet part of the principle

67
0:04:30.440 --> 0:04:33.760
of cryptocurrency is anonymity and I don't understand why this doesn't exist

68
0:04:33.760 --> 0:04:37.920
anymore my crypto wallets are incredibly secret I'm not going to tell you what

69
0:04:37.920 --> 0:04:41.280
they are where they are who they are how many I have what they have on them

70
0:04:41.280 --> 0:04:46.200
that's not the goal of crypto right the goal of crypto is that there is a level

71
0:04:46.200 --> 0:04:50.760
of anonymity to it sharing information about my wallets publicly is problematic

72
0:04:50.760 --> 0:04:53.320
and I don't know why we've got to that point I don't know why we have those

73
0:04:53.320 --> 0:04:57.280
domain names you can link to a wallet address and be like yo you can see all

74
0:04:57.280 --> 0:05:01.240
my bank transactions you can see much cheese I'm buying right so I have a

75
0:05:01.240 --> 0:05:04.280
counter question to that which is could you please provide a transaction history

76
0:05:04.280 --> 0:05:07.320
of your entire bank account over the last millennia and I'll take a look at

77
0:05:07.320 --> 0:05:11.520
that and find all the weird stuff that you've purchased moving on to their next

78
0:05:11.520 --> 0:05:16.720
question T asks what are the plans going forwards in regards to influx of ERC

79
0:05:16.720 --> 0:05:22.000
players we actually scaled quite well we got some comments actually from this

80
0:05:22.000 --> 0:05:26.160
these groups as well so we have two volunteer groups within the the Neos

81
0:05:26.160 --> 0:05:30.120
community and the largest sort of Neos team is an umbrella term called the

82
0:05:30.120 --> 0:05:33.920
mentors and moderators moderators are responsible for guideline violations and

83
0:05:33.920 --> 0:05:37.480
and just sort of keeping things in check and I want to say police because they

84
0:05:37.480 --> 0:05:39.920
aren't police right they're not beat cops they're not gonna arrest you they

85
0:05:39.920 --> 0:05:43.280
don't have tasers they don't have firearms they're there to just try and

86
0:05:43.280 --> 0:05:46.480
make sure everyone's safe and if there's issues that come up they're there to try

87
0:05:46.480 --> 0:05:50.440
and resolve them and then there's the mentors and there is a lot of overlap

88
0:05:50.440 --> 0:05:55.560
between this the mentors are a volunteer group that are designed to help you out

89
0:05:55.560 --> 0:05:58.960
with inside Neos now it is not correct to say that if you're not a mentor you

90
0:05:58.960 --> 0:06:03.000
can't help anyone and everyone can help at any time I was in MTC sessions

91
0:06:03.000 --> 0:06:07.040
yesterday helping out and I'm a team member I had one person and one person

92
0:06:07.040 --> 0:06:09.560
only who direct messaged me and said should you be working on the actual

93
0:06:09.560 --> 0:06:13.240
platform rather than helping out new users and I just said no I didn't want

94
0:06:13.240 --> 0:06:16.040
to entertain that with any other answer right we had an influx of new users we

95
0:06:16.040 --> 0:06:18.800
needed as many people as we could so I was helping out new users I think I'm

96
0:06:18.800 --> 0:06:23.840
entitled to do that those groups were scaled a lot sort of earlier on in the

97
0:06:23.840 --> 0:06:27.040
year we scaled them a lot we added a lot more to them and and like I said even

98
0:06:27.040 --> 0:06:30.040
from some of those people inside those groups they're like only scaling too

99
0:06:30.040 --> 0:06:34.640
much like don't we have too many mods or too many mentors based on yesterday no

100
0:06:34.640 --> 0:06:40.200
we have quite frankly enough or in some cases not enough like it was it was very

101
0:06:40.200 --> 0:06:46.080
very very busy so we scaled quite well for those and we'll probably continue

102
0:06:46.080 --> 0:06:50.800
scaling if we see additional upticks such that they can grow and scale as the

103
0:06:50.800 --> 0:06:55.800
as the platform grows and scales for information on the mentor program which

104
0:06:55.800 --> 0:06:59.440
is I don't to say free to join because that makes it sound like it's some sort

105
0:06:59.440 --> 0:07:04.920
of paid service but like it is you know it is anyone can join it anyone can

106
0:07:04.920 --> 0:07:07.440
become a mentor and remember if you're not a mentor you can still help it's

107
0:07:07.440 --> 0:07:10.520
just like hey if you want to go that extra mile and become a mentor then you

108
0:07:10.520 --> 0:07:13.000
can go ahead and become a mentor there's information on mentors when I can spell

109
0:07:13.000 --> 0:07:16.960
it correctly here and there's also information on the moderation team

110
0:07:16.960 --> 0:07:22.120
moderation team is a little bit more difficult to join because it's a

111
0:07:22.120 --> 0:07:26.120
different level of commitment that's there actually don't think we have

112
0:07:26.120 --> 0:07:30.360
moderation applications open currently but there we go

113
0:07:30.360 --> 0:07:33.800
additionally there's also this lovely page I wrote called how to help which

114
0:07:33.800 --> 0:07:37.560
talks about the ways that you can help us do cool stuff so there you go there's

115
0:07:37.560 --> 0:07:42.480
how to help I know there's lots of links today but that's because I have written

116
0:07:42.480 --> 0:07:45.680
a lot of those pages or collaborate on those pages with the community and they

117
0:07:45.680 --> 0:07:50.400
just have so much information you'll see a lot of repeated questions in the in

118
0:07:50.400 --> 0:07:54.560
the discord and we're fine to answer repeated questions of course but hey if

119
0:07:54.560 --> 0:07:56.980
you're if you're nervous about asking questions or you think it might be a

120
0:07:56.980 --> 0:08:01.960
silly question it's not but also remember the information is on the the

121
0:08:01.960 --> 0:08:04.680
wiki there as well and if there is information on the wiki that you think

122
0:08:04.680 --> 0:08:08.000
is missing go ahead and edit it anyone can edit it anyone on the planet your

123
0:08:08.000 --> 0:08:12.120
mother your father your grandfather your aunt your cousin your dog anyone who can

124
0:08:12.120 --> 0:08:16.600
access a keyboard can edit the wiki no permission is required if you want to

125
0:08:16.600 --> 0:08:19.720
edit the wiki and feel like contributing then there is a page called contributing

126
0:08:19.720 --> 0:08:26.040
to the wiki which can also help like I said lots of links here it's linked down

127
0:08:26.040 --> 0:08:33.960
all right let's go ahead and move onwards let's take a look okay so we got

128
0:08:33.960 --> 0:08:37.560
that one whoever's reacting with cues can you also get thank you for adding

129
0:08:37.560 --> 0:08:42.400
the the checkmarks are you but it's Lex today thank you so much I do want to

130
0:08:42.400 --> 0:08:47.560
double check I know who's doing it every day so we got dust question we got the

131
0:08:47.560 --> 0:08:50.920
hardware quality question and we got takes question onto hacks question access

132
0:08:50.920 --> 0:08:54.200
so a good way of handling syncing to inventory or things loading into the

133
0:08:54.200 --> 0:08:56.840
world and it's recently it's been a bit slower than usual with making things to

134
0:08:56.840 --> 0:09:00.600
appear making it harder to help people put their avatars together there was

135
0:09:00.600 --> 0:09:04.840
some server load issues yesterday because quite frankly we didn't know

136
0:09:04.840 --> 0:09:10.120
that we were going to get a larger like a scale event we have now adjusted our

137
0:09:10.120 --> 0:09:13.480
infrastructure to handle that scale event including the registration cap

138
0:09:13.480 --> 0:09:17.200
which may seem annoying for questions about the registration cap do ask I

139
0:09:17.200 --> 0:09:19.440
won't go into it unless there's an ask though because I could talk about it for

140
0:09:19.440 --> 0:09:22.040
like 20 minutes and I don't want to waste that time so if you're interested

141
0:09:22.040 --> 0:09:25.920
please go ahead and ask um so we are adjusting things to make that a little

142
0:09:25.920 --> 0:09:31.400
bit better what I would say there is if you are helping people out consider

143
0:09:31.400 --> 0:09:36.480
using a more performant avatar I don't want to say look like it's a mentor even

144
0:09:36.480 --> 0:09:38.800
if you're not a mentor but I don't want to say as a helper you need a uniform

145
0:09:38.800 --> 0:09:42.720
because you don't need to abide by guidelines of course but like maybe a

146
0:09:42.720 --> 0:09:45.920
lighter avatar might help because then when you're joining the session to help

147
0:09:45.920 --> 0:09:51.760
them you're then not em what's the word for like burdening that's the word

148
0:09:51.760 --> 0:09:55.440
you're not burdening that session with your avatar you're you're just giving a

149
0:09:55.440 --> 0:09:58.560
light thing for your presence your character and then everything else

150
0:09:58.560 --> 0:10:01.760
spawned in is targeted for them then that will give like a little bit less

151
0:10:01.760 --> 0:10:06.000
load on that session steam randomly just disconnected from the internet that's

152
0:10:06.000 --> 0:10:11.840
fine and jump scared me on my computer and then other than that is just just

153
0:10:11.840 --> 0:10:14.800
think about what you're spawning there are some items that can also be created

154
0:10:14.800 --> 0:10:18.160
without using the inventory for example if you add like a developer tooltip

155
0:10:18.160 --> 0:10:22.040
component to an empty object it should automatically create a cone it'll be old

156
0:10:22.040 --> 0:10:26.600
red cone rather than the new sort of gold sparkly dev tip but it still works

157
0:10:26.600 --> 0:10:30.280
same with the logic step it will create a blue cone for you so can also be like

158
0:10:30.280 --> 0:10:34.560
an emergency thing we still noticing issues do please continue reporting them

159
0:10:34.560 --> 0:10:38.280
we do like seeing those we can do more I mean can we do want to hear about that

160
0:10:38.280 --> 0:10:43.560
if there's any problems all right let's move forwards to TPW use question hi

161
0:10:43.560 --> 0:10:47.400
TPW I see that you're new to the discord so welcome to Neos as was TK actually so

162
0:10:47.400 --> 0:10:51.080
welcome to the discord as well while Neos has great tools for developers one

163
0:10:51.080 --> 0:10:54.440
thing that turns new people that aren't tech savvy is the complexity of the base

164
0:10:54.440 --> 0:10:57.000
menu especially with the influx of VLC players is there any vision of

165
0:10:57.000 --> 0:11:00.520
streamlining things where it remain pretty much the same it will be like

166
0:11:00.520 --> 0:11:07.400
night and day eventually so what we want to do is initially we want to first of

167
0:11:07.400 --> 0:11:12.400
all replace all the old UI with new UI easy way to explain that is actually

168
0:11:12.400 --> 0:11:15.880
using dark mode and light mode anything that is in light mode right now and that

169
0:11:15.880 --> 0:11:20.240
includes inspectors because those are light it needs to be like entirely

170
0:11:20.240 --> 0:11:26.080
reworked in some cases from the ground up to be in our new UI system there's UI

171
0:11:26.080 --> 0:11:30.800
which is the old UI system and then UI X which is the new UI system once that's

172
0:11:30.800 --> 0:11:36.520
all reworked it will have an initial pass which will improve the UI the UX

173
0:11:36.520 --> 0:11:41.200
design of those those units initially but it also allow us to continue

174
0:11:41.200 --> 0:11:47.560
developing that UI further in response to feedback from you guys and ideas

175
0:11:47.560 --> 0:11:51.880
suggestions enhancements added to that because of the way that we build our new

176
0:11:51.880 --> 0:11:56.960
UI it is entirely customizable as an example here to kind of illustrate

177
0:11:56.960 --> 0:12:01.960
what's going on the world browser which is in the new UI scheme there's more

178
0:12:01.960 --> 0:12:05.920
work that we need to do on the UI on the world browser for sure but it is in the

179
0:12:05.920 --> 0:12:13.960
new UI system that is entirely editable by you as an example of that there is a

180
0:12:13.960 --> 0:12:17.800
facet I made which is a simplified world browser that just shows the worlds that

181
0:12:17.800 --> 0:12:20.400
you're in allows you to close out of them it's probably the most popular

182
0:12:20.400 --> 0:12:24.680
thing I've made in a long time another example and I don't know if I can

183
0:12:24.680 --> 0:12:27.480
remember the name of the world there is I think that's called Nexus portal I

184
0:12:27.480 --> 0:12:30.400
should actually visit that last night seemed crazy something like that it's a

185
0:12:30.400 --> 0:12:35.400
world that I made where I took the world browser and I made it 3d again and so I

186
0:12:35.400 --> 0:12:39.000
made each world that is in the world browser as an active session a like

187
0:12:39.000 --> 0:12:43.440
doorway in this like grassy knoll floating in space and it used to be

188
0:12:43.440 --> 0:12:46.960
quite easy to make that render because there wasn't that many sessions open but

189
0:12:46.960 --> 0:12:49.960
it'll probably be a mess these days but again that's just me editing the world

190
0:12:49.960 --> 0:12:53.920
browser added to that parts of the world browser actually generic so for example

191
0:12:53.920 --> 0:12:57.400
the search bar there's nothing in that search bar that determines that it's

192
0:12:57.400 --> 0:13:01.200
searching worlds the search bar just says this is what's in my search query

193
0:13:01.200 --> 0:13:05.760
and the world browser then picks that up using sort of interrupt between those

194
0:13:05.760 --> 0:13:08.560
segments and it means that they can sort of be dragged around a little bit what

195
0:13:08.560 --> 0:13:12.120
I'm basically saying there about rambling on too much more is once the UI

196
0:13:12.120 --> 0:13:15.280
is over to the system you build it yourself hey you want an inspector

197
0:13:15.280 --> 0:13:18.120
that's bright pink you can build it yourself hey you want an inspector that

198
0:13:18.120 --> 0:13:21.280
is in still in light mode even if we default to dark mode go for it you want

199
0:13:21.280 --> 0:13:23.920
an inspector with different font go for it you want a bigger font size go for it

200
0:13:23.920 --> 0:13:27.800
want a small font size go for it people already do this they create custom

201
0:13:27.800 --> 0:13:30.840
inspectors and feel free to continue using those but once we have that new

202
0:13:30.840 --> 0:13:34.400
system in place for inspectors it'll be a lot easier to do that and it'll be a

203
0:13:34.400 --> 0:13:41.120
lot less prone to errors and issues so and a short summary everything's gonna

204
0:13:41.120 --> 0:13:46.120
change like honestly it's gonna look like you put you know your ducks and

205
0:13:46.120 --> 0:13:49.160
your whites together in the laundry machine and it's come out like a

206
0:13:49.160 --> 0:13:53.800
completely new garment and you're just like cool yes I now have a grey t-shirt

207
0:13:53.800 --> 0:13:58.000
instead of a white t-shirt moving forwards let's take a look at what is

208
0:13:58.000 --> 0:14:03.240
next okay so neko gama has a not a question just something I'd like to

209
0:14:03.240 --> 0:14:08.880
bring to attention since I'm since I'm since I mentioned the miss list neko was

210
0:14:08.880 --> 0:14:11.960
recently asked by decent our friends if Neos is owned by Facebook due to the

211
0:14:11.960 --> 0:14:16.080
term metaverse just want to give a quick heads up I don't like this and there's

212
0:14:16.080 --> 0:14:22.920
nothing I can really do about it asking whether Neos is owned by Facebook is

213
0:14:22.920 --> 0:14:29.600
kind of the same as asking if any book that you own in your library of books on

214
0:14:29.600 --> 0:14:33.560
your bookshelf is owned by Facebook because it's got the word book in it and

215
0:14:33.560 --> 0:14:38.040
I understand the confusion and I wish that Manta hadn't chosen that particular

216
0:14:38.040 --> 0:14:44.520
name but that's just the way that we were in the world that we live in Neos

217
0:14:44.520 --> 0:14:48.060
is not owned by Facebook if it was we would have to declare it and if we

218
0:14:48.060 --> 0:14:51.920
declared it it would be on the bottom of our website and it would probably be a

219
0:14:51.920 --> 0:14:56.320
part of the UI and hey maybe you'd need a Facebook account to log into Neos so

220
0:14:56.320 --> 0:15:00.720
we are not very easy to prove that I will add it to the miss list I would

221
0:15:00.720 --> 0:15:05.200
also encourage those that have that kind of thought process to look beyond words

222
0:15:05.200 --> 0:15:09.960
and and finding associations for that so the the word meta that's in metaverse

223
0:15:09.960 --> 0:15:16.200
just means like different or adjunct to the normal thing so there's a good

224
0:15:16.200 --> 0:15:20.200
example there being meta data so metadata is data about the data so a

225
0:15:20.200 --> 0:15:24.040
good example of metadata is a picture that you saved to your computer the

226
0:15:24.040 --> 0:15:27.640
picture which might be of your favorite cheese collection is a picture that's

227
0:15:27.640 --> 0:15:31.680
the data there's computer you know code or binary on that computer which is

228
0:15:31.680 --> 0:15:35.600
describing what that cheese collection looks like but then there's meta data

229
0:15:35.600 --> 0:15:40.840
which is when you took the picture what like focus and zoom that camera was and

230
0:15:40.840 --> 0:15:46.600
etc and that metadata also isn't owned by Facebook it's meta data additionally

231
0:15:46.600 --> 0:15:51.760
there is a company called meta threads who I'm vaguely aware of because I used

232
0:15:51.760 --> 0:15:55.720
to be in the streaming area as a job and they had really good outfits and

233
0:15:55.720 --> 0:15:58.840
clothing they're probably angry right now and there was another company that I

234
0:15:58.840 --> 0:16:02.400
believe currently is suing meta because the use of the name but I don't want to

235
0:16:02.400 --> 0:16:05.200
comment on that because it's not like a good place to sort of comment on the

236
0:16:05.200 --> 0:16:12.860
affairs of other companies scrolling down to another question Alexios says

237
0:16:12.860 --> 0:16:16.720
and UI streamlining is desperately needed but you know the situation after

238
0:16:16.720 --> 0:16:19.400
us is there any team members working developed at all or is everyone in the

239
0:16:19.400 --> 0:16:23.360
protest thing it is difficult to use the word protest I've heard some people use

240
0:16:23.360 --> 0:16:27.160
the word strike it isn't either of those we have stopped working because of

241
0:16:27.160 --> 0:16:30.560
negotiations currently it is not a strike it is not a protest if it was a

242
0:16:30.560 --> 0:16:35.200
strike or a protest I wouldn't be here speaking to you if you strike from let's

243
0:16:35.200 --> 0:16:39.040
say a factory job you don't go to the factory if you strike from a programming

244
0:16:39.040 --> 0:16:43.680
job you don't program and you don't attend the job we have everyone in here

245
0:16:43.680 --> 0:16:47.200
like I saw shifty typing shifty has some messages I saw Canadian get typing

246
0:16:47.200 --> 0:16:50.360
there's probably got messages from them on the scroll list but I keep the scroll

247
0:16:50.360 --> 0:16:54.660
to the questions I'm answering so yeah we're still working but we're working in

248
0:16:54.660 --> 0:17:00.680
other areas depends what you what you mean there is still stuff happening it's

249
0:17:00.680 --> 0:17:05.920
just we're not releasing updates currently moving forwards to the next

250
0:17:05.920 --> 0:17:10.000
question that's exactly the same question from index there yeah news is

251
0:17:10.000 --> 0:17:14.440
still being developed we're still working we're just not releasing updates

252
0:17:14.440 --> 0:17:19.080
Jin has updated the question hardware alerts which says I only want to know if

253
0:17:19.080 --> 0:17:22.360
the news team takes seriously security seriously with hardware wallet questions

254
0:17:22.360 --> 0:17:26.120
most crypto teams devs marketplace recommended hardware to users to protect

255
0:17:26.120 --> 0:17:28.400
themselves based on a confidence of any on the team took it serious and an

256
0:17:28.400 --> 0:17:32.440
advocate of such I am an advocate of hardware is and if you ask me what I

257
0:17:32.440 --> 0:17:37.040
recommend you store your cryptocurrency on I would say a hardware wallet what

258
0:17:37.040 --> 0:17:40.720
that's a different question though that's hey prime what would you

259
0:17:40.720 --> 0:17:44.880
recommend to increase the security of your Neos account and I would say hey go

260
0:17:44.880 --> 0:17:48.160
ahead turn on 2fa make sure you have a password not using on any other site and

261
0:17:48.160 --> 0:17:52.400
when you create and turn on 2fa make sure you save those backup codes a part

262
0:17:52.400 --> 0:17:55.920
of turning on the 2fa process will ask you to save the backup codes and I know

263
0:17:55.920 --> 0:17:59.480
some people don't if you don't save your backup codes and you lose your 2fa

264
0:17:59.480 --> 0:18:03.400
device you kind of screwed so when a computer tells you to save backup codes

265
0:18:03.400 --> 0:18:07.500
and this is any platform of 2fa if they present backup codes to you you save

266
0:18:07.500 --> 0:18:12.960
them so yeah I we are security serious like we have a security policy for

267
0:18:12.960 --> 0:18:17.440
reports and security etc we take it very secure it's very securely we take

268
0:18:17.440 --> 0:18:22.000
security very seriously was I was trying to say and we have a lot of looking

269
0:18:22.000 --> 0:18:27.720
insight and information that we're looking at as security grows what that

270
0:18:27.720 --> 0:18:30.900
doesn't mean is that I need to talk to you about my personal life or my

271
0:18:30.900 --> 0:18:36.240
personal crypto wallets that is a bad measure if my front door has no lock on

272
0:18:36.240 --> 0:18:40.760
it it doesn't mean that my code is insecure it just means that I'm

273
0:18:40.760 --> 0:18:43.760
replacing my front door actually have a friend who's replacing their front door

274
0:18:43.760 --> 0:18:47.040
it blew open in the wind and got wrecked and they bought the wrong size door so

275
0:18:47.040 --> 0:18:50.520
they had to return it I'm like I didn't think that was like a thing that could

276
0:18:50.520 --> 0:18:54.520
happen but it was a thing most the wrong size handle I can't remember anyway they

277
0:18:54.520 --> 0:18:58.240
had to replace their door and it was a big sort of spectacle because you know

278
0:18:58.240 --> 0:19:03.240
you need to get a door the right size moving onwards um it has an update on

279
0:19:03.240 --> 0:19:09.240
moderation team which has applications on an as no-kneader basis fantastic get

280
0:19:09.240 --> 0:19:13.360
also mentions that needing new mods would be identified like different

281
0:19:13.360 --> 0:19:17.880
languages different locale stuff like that that would be good to see if you

282
0:19:17.880 --> 0:19:21.560
haven't seen it already if you looked at the Twitter hashtag we have a large and

283
0:19:21.560 --> 0:19:27.160
I mean quite large representation in the Japanese area Japanese locale Japanese

284
0:19:27.160 --> 0:19:31.240
language they are fantastic they do some of the amazing things take a look at the

285
0:19:31.240 --> 0:19:37.040
MMC 2021 2022 2019 it should just look at all the MMCs for crazy creations

286
0:19:37.040 --> 0:19:41.720
from that community the same goes for Korean as well we have a lot of Korean

287
0:19:41.720 --> 0:19:46.640
users that are amazing I have since some sort of rumblings of Spanish which is

288
0:19:46.640 --> 0:19:50.840
cool so we've been looking into like that I know that we have a Spanish badge

289
0:19:50.840 --> 0:19:53.080
we sometimes give out to people or actually don't know anyone that's with

290
0:19:53.080 --> 0:19:59.000
I've not seen it um but yeah if you are in a growing area of language or locale

291
0:19:59.000 --> 0:20:02.600
that you think that we might need we'll take a look and have a look at it

292
0:20:02.600 --> 0:20:05.980
we haven't seen it as well we have built by the Japanese community actually we

293
0:20:05.980 --> 0:20:09.040
have some translation devices where you can basically just like stick them to

294
0:20:09.040 --> 0:20:13.200
your head and then when you speak the translator text in whatever language you

295
0:20:13.200 --> 0:20:18.240
want will appear above your head and it's beautiful moving forwards to other

296
0:20:18.240 --> 0:20:21.720
questions which is maybe we have another one from neko thank you for that I did

297
0:20:21.720 --> 0:20:25.000
want to ask one thing I noticed is a bit of performance for high use accounts by

298
0:20:25.000 --> 0:20:28.400
hardware not being even halfway utilized is this more of a network ish or

299
0:20:28.400 --> 0:20:32.720
something bigger the force in the US is a very complicated beast I'll call it a

300
0:20:32.720 --> 0:20:36.360
beast because it's one that the nearest team are going to tackle with multiple

301
0:20:36.360 --> 0:20:41.360
tools and implements there are a lot of things that we just haven't done when it

302
0:20:41.360 --> 0:20:45.360
comes to optimization and we plan to do one of those being we want to optimize

303
0:20:45.360 --> 0:20:50.160
the IK a little bit and then another one being hey want to optimize entirely the

304
0:20:50.160 --> 0:20:53.640
renderer by replacing it which will get us some optimizations we also want to

305
0:20:53.640 --> 0:20:57.080
optimize the language that Neos is written in and by that I mean we want to

306
0:20:57.080 --> 0:21:01.080
change the version of dotnet we're using which gives us again performance

307
0:21:01.080 --> 0:21:04.840
improvements just simply because hey we're compiling to a different target so

308
0:21:04.840 --> 0:21:08.140
there's a lots of things that we need to do there it is something that we know is

309
0:21:08.140 --> 0:21:12.440
a is a miss on our part is that we can't have worlds with as bigger numbers as

310
0:21:12.440 --> 0:21:16.200
other platforms but do know that we are taking a look at it if you want to know

311
0:21:16.200 --> 0:21:19.800
what you can do to kind of mitigate that the the biggest thing you can do is get

312
0:21:19.800 --> 0:21:23.400
out of an avatar that has full IK we call them head and hands avatar

313
0:21:23.400 --> 0:21:26.120
sometimes they're called flatties I don't particularly like that one because

314
0:21:26.120 --> 0:21:31.200
my head and hands avatar isn't flat but if you remember the default avatar that

315
0:21:31.200 --> 0:21:33.880
you had when you came into Neos when you were creating your account before you

316
0:21:33.880 --> 0:21:38.160
set up your avatar it just had hands and that floating headset you can create as

317
0:21:38.160 --> 0:21:44.640
like those using basically anything if you import a bench a park bench into the

318
0:21:44.640 --> 0:21:49.240
game you can go to avatar creator slap the headset the head part of the avatar

319
0:21:49.240 --> 0:21:52.560
create on that concrete bench hit create avatar and you'll have a head and hands

320
0:21:52.560 --> 0:21:56.480
avatar that looks like a bench with hands those are more performant I don't

321
0:21:56.480 --> 0:22:00.320
want to tell you to do that all the time or say like you must do that because

322
0:22:00.320 --> 0:22:03.720
again you lose the character there you lose the full body tracking you lose the

323
0:22:03.720 --> 0:22:09.040
legs you know you lose the chest so it's it's up to you and then in addition to

324
0:22:09.040 --> 0:22:13.400
that is to make sure that you're watching whatever you're spawning in good

325
0:22:13.400 --> 0:22:16.760
often examples there being video players trying to keep video players low I've

326
0:22:16.760 --> 0:22:20.080
noticed a couple of people will do the sort of thing where they like they'll

327
0:22:20.080 --> 0:22:23.320
spawn in videos and just kind of like cue them up like a deck of cards each

328
0:22:23.320 --> 0:22:26.920
video player is causing like quite a lot of performance problems so like just

329
0:22:26.920 --> 0:22:30.760
try and keep that down that isn't a big contributor to performance but when you

330
0:22:30.760 --> 0:22:35.160
got like you know a deck of cards of ten waiting videos to play yeah lots of

331
0:22:35.160 --> 0:22:38.400
other things there you have a specific questions about what you need to

332
0:22:38.400 --> 0:22:42.820
optimize do let me know so moving onwards Sven oh second it's not Sven

333
0:22:42.820 --> 0:22:47.200
second I've been pronouncing that one right so second asked her to confirm on

334
0:22:47.200 --> 0:22:50.200
blend shapes if they are zero are they still a performance problem is only when

335
0:22:50.200 --> 0:22:52.840
they have a value if they're on zero they have a performance problem if they

336
0:22:52.840 --> 0:22:55.960
exist they have a performance problem the performance problem occurs because

337
0:22:55.960 --> 0:23:01.640
we need to load data into various parts of Neos that determine what will happen

338
0:23:01.640 --> 0:23:05.560
if that blend shape changes so a good example here and it's a really silly one

339
0:23:05.560 --> 0:23:08.920
I wish I you know but it's a really good example is there are a lot of avatar

340
0:23:08.920 --> 0:23:13.820
bases which have a I mean I'm gonna like generalize here a little bit apologize

341
0:23:13.820 --> 0:23:16.840
for that they kind of have a male female slider it might be boobs it might be

342
0:23:16.840 --> 0:23:19.760
butts right but you can change the presentation of the avatar to be male

343
0:23:19.760 --> 0:23:23.700
presenting or female presenting if you have made the decision about what you

344
0:23:23.700 --> 0:23:28.040
want that character the avatar to be that blend shape needs to not exist and

345
0:23:28.040 --> 0:23:30.800
you can do that by baking your blend shapes I'll go ahead and link that

346
0:23:30.800 --> 0:23:35.460
tutorial in the in the chat here what that does is it takes the current

347
0:23:35.460 --> 0:23:40.080
position of all those vertices with that blend shape applied and then applies it

348
0:23:40.080 --> 0:23:43.620
to the the base blend shape or the basis if you've made a blend of terminology

349
0:23:43.620 --> 0:23:46.680
and then it deletes that blend shapes would no longer needs to exist and what

350
0:23:46.680 --> 0:23:51.320
that does is it signals to the to the engine to Neos hey I'm not going to

351
0:23:51.320 --> 0:23:54.800
change wherever or not I have breasts anymore in this avatar I have locked

352
0:23:54.800 --> 0:23:59.120
that choice in and again I'm not saying that that needs to be permanent if you

353
0:23:59.120 --> 0:24:03.240
save two copies of the avatar one that has those blend shapes baked and one

354
0:24:03.240 --> 0:24:06.880
that doesn't then the one that has those blend shapes baked is more performant

355
0:24:06.880 --> 0:24:10.680
and if you ever want to change those slides again you can load the unperformant

356
0:24:10.680 --> 0:24:15.960
one and then make those changes I'm searching YouTube for Baker blend shapes

357
0:24:15.960 --> 0:24:19.840
and I got some very weird results I need to go to my youtube channel and search it

358
0:24:19.840 --> 0:24:25.760
there like how to bake a cake no bake your blend shapes not a cake here we are

359
0:24:25.760 --> 0:24:34.280
moving moving forwards to an additional question where I scroll the scroll the

360
0:24:34.280 --> 0:24:40.720
scroll the scroll the scroll toy says a bit of an off-topic question any cool

361
0:24:40.720 --> 0:24:44.120
hardware it's popping up that's got your attention lately I'm still a streamer at

362
0:24:44.120 --> 0:24:48.360
heart I used to stream a lot I don't anymore but I am like really wise to the

363
0:24:48.360 --> 0:24:53.120
streaming hardware area the coolest piece of hardware in that area that I

364
0:24:53.120 --> 0:24:56.320
bought recently not recently it was actually like almost a year ago now but

365
0:24:56.320 --> 0:24:59.320
I still love it every day the reason it comes to mind is because the place I

366
0:24:59.320 --> 0:25:03.120
bought it from was like a local store because they had it in stock and Amazon

367
0:25:03.120 --> 0:25:08.960
didn't and that store like still every like six months sends me a little letter

368
0:25:08.960 --> 0:25:12.680
with their catalog attached and just says like thanks for being a customer

369
0:25:12.680 --> 0:25:16.240
here's our catalog in case you need anything else and it's just like it is

370
0:25:16.240 --> 0:25:19.960
like slightly annoying but also kind of cute as a company doing that but anyway

371
0:25:19.960 --> 0:25:23.760
so yeah it's the go XLR mini it's what I'm actually talking to you on I like

372
0:25:23.760 --> 0:25:27.240
it is every day I don't use it to its full advantage but like it solved a very

373
0:25:27.240 --> 0:25:31.720
big issue I had with microphones so that was cool as for new hardware more in the

374
0:25:31.720 --> 0:25:39.160
realms of the like VR space I'm a backer a backer I'm a pre-order of the

375
0:25:39.160 --> 0:25:43.480
ettie controllers and I'm really interested in trying them because I I

376
0:25:43.480 --> 0:25:47.520
think I might like the feel I don't know if I'll actually like them but I

377
0:25:47.520 --> 0:25:51.120
pre-ordered them so I'm kind of like biased to be like I want to try them

378
0:25:51.120 --> 0:25:56.320
just in case I've let you know waste my investment here unfortunately the ettie

379
0:25:56.320 --> 0:25:58.600
controllers have had a couple of production delays they are very

380
0:25:58.600 --> 0:26:02.620
understandable it is very difficult to get a new product to market when you

381
0:26:02.620 --> 0:26:05.760
need to build circuit boards and also like the actual plastic that goes around

382
0:26:05.760 --> 0:26:10.040
that so I am patient with them and I'm excited to see what they can do with

383
0:26:10.040 --> 0:26:13.840
them we do have limited support for an earlier version of the ettie controllers

384
0:26:13.840 --> 0:26:17.000
they will probably need to be additional work when they're the ettie controllers

385
0:26:17.000 --> 0:26:22.520
in their final state arrives but I will be quite motivated to do that seeing as

386
0:26:22.520 --> 0:26:27.960
I'll have them lying in my apartment let's move along why the Duff says why

387
0:26:27.960 --> 0:26:31.600
do people from VRC keep asking if they need to buy dinner bones for Neos this

388
0:26:31.600 --> 0:26:37.460
is an unfortunate naming problem that we have so when it comes to Neos we have

389
0:26:37.460 --> 0:26:44.000
dynamic bones that are very very very similar to VR chats fizz bones and VR

390
0:26:44.000 --> 0:26:47.120
chats dynamic bones which actually aren't owned by VR chat long story but

391
0:26:47.120 --> 0:26:52.280
you know like we have very similar things but they are completely different

392
0:26:52.280 --> 0:26:56.000
so if you want to draw a Venn diagram there is like no overlap in terms of

393
0:26:56.000 --> 0:27:01.680
code like VR chat fizz bones completely different from dynamic bones the asset

394
0:27:01.680 --> 0:27:07.680
library thing and then our dynamic bones completely separate from both of those

395
0:27:07.680 --> 0:27:11.840
other two the problem there that then happens is because dynamic bones are

396
0:27:11.840 --> 0:27:15.160
called dynamic bones in Neos they think that they are the same thing and that's

397
0:27:15.160 --> 0:27:19.640
quite perfect like it's it's a perfect mistake and a confusion to have and

398
0:27:19.640 --> 0:27:23.920
that's why they ask if they need to buy it if you are a member of our community

399
0:27:23.920 --> 0:27:29.360
please get a banner get on a horse and charge into the sunset with a giant

400
0:27:29.360 --> 0:27:33.160
banner dynamic bones on Neos are free the reason why they're named dynamic

401
0:27:33.160 --> 0:27:36.560
bones or close to that language is because of the opposite of that we

402
0:27:36.560 --> 0:27:39.760
didn't want to name them something really obscure because then people would

403
0:27:39.760 --> 0:27:43.280
have the opposite problem they wouldn't feel that they're familiar they wouldn't

404
0:27:43.280 --> 0:27:46.960
know how to talk about them etc that's also the case with the case with fizz

405
0:27:46.960 --> 0:27:50.400
bones right whenever I think about fizz bones which is what PRC uses now I'll

406
0:27:50.400 --> 0:27:53.920
find myself calling them dynamic bones just because it's in my vocabulary even

407
0:27:53.920 --> 0:27:58.000
though they're completely different you need to call things what they are and

408
0:27:58.000 --> 0:28:01.960
that association has power and so therefore calling them dynamic bones has

409
0:28:01.960 --> 0:28:06.240
power I added them to a couple of avatars yesterday and I said like

410
0:28:06.240 --> 0:28:09.560
there's lots of controls here you know you can do what you want they are quite

411
0:28:09.560 --> 0:28:13.240
similar but they are different and the user is helping took a look at the

412
0:28:13.240 --> 0:28:16.520
inspector panel for the dynamic bones and when I could work with this it looks

413
0:28:16.520 --> 0:28:19.760
quite similar and they just were off and playing with the dynamic bones and that

414
0:28:19.760 --> 0:28:24.960
was perfect and yes just clarifying that dynamic bones was a paid add-on for the

415
0:28:24.960 --> 0:28:28.800
ERC made by someone who doesn't have any investment they're not employed or

416
0:28:28.800 --> 0:28:33.680
anything at VR excuse me at VRC they just need they're just it was just an

417
0:28:33.680 --> 0:28:37.200
add-on you could buy I know a lot of people didn't buy it and that makes me

418
0:28:37.200 --> 0:28:41.160
sad but I do wish I could buy I don't know interview the original creator and

419
0:28:41.160 --> 0:28:44.680
be like did you know that this add-on was gonna be used for it was being used

420
0:28:44.680 --> 0:28:48.560
for because I don't think they did like they made it a long time ago moving on

421
0:28:48.560 --> 0:28:51.360
with lots of questions here we will run over if there's still questions go and

422
0:28:51.360 --> 0:28:55.000
it is a busy day because of the new influx so don't worry about that we'll

423
0:28:55.000 --> 0:28:58.560
just we'll just keep keep on keeping on if I get to the bottom of the list and

424
0:28:58.560 --> 0:29:03.160
we're starting to run a bit dry I'll let you know so on to egg roll force that's

425
0:29:03.160 --> 0:29:07.080
a crazy username that sounds like I don't know if you know the video game

426
0:29:07.080 --> 0:29:10.480
series EDF earth defense force it sounds like you'll be right at home playing

427
0:29:10.480 --> 0:29:14.240
that one so egg roll force ask is there a best practices for hosting instances

428
0:29:14.240 --> 0:29:19.040
specifically for running more sandboxing instances on a headless yes first thing

429
0:29:19.040 --> 0:29:23.360
I would say there is have rules so we do have guidelines you'll see get like

430
0:29:23.360 --> 0:29:27.080
basically banging a drum about guidelines I do as well those are the

431
0:29:27.080 --> 0:29:30.280
guidelines which are platform global right we don't care what type of session

432
0:29:30.280 --> 0:29:32.840
you're in you need to be following those guidelines when it comes to hosting your

433
0:29:32.840 --> 0:29:37.320
own sessions you can add rules to that so it would be perfectly acceptable for

434
0:29:37.320 --> 0:29:40.760
you to run a headless which had a rule which said no yellow things and then

435
0:29:40.760 --> 0:29:44.160
fruits wouldn't be able to join perfectly acceptable weird but perfectly

436
0:29:44.160 --> 0:29:48.280
acceptable so do come up with list of rules for your session if you want

437
0:29:48.280 --> 0:29:53.800
recommended rules like I said keep the video players down don't build on spawn

438
0:29:53.800 --> 0:29:57.280
I hate it when people build on spawn move away from spawn to build people

439
0:29:57.280 --> 0:30:01.760
don't want to spawn into your creations and then other rules like that you can

440
0:30:01.760 --> 0:30:05.680
see some example rules in the MTC we recently added them because we needed to

441
0:30:05.680 --> 0:30:08.960
like add some couple more rules to the MTC we'll just join a couple of

442
0:30:08.960 --> 0:30:12.200
headlaces to do that I might write up an article on like some other rules I would

443
0:30:12.200 --> 0:30:18.040
generally have it's just a little bit like wordy to go into as for a sandbox

444
0:30:18.040 --> 0:30:20.880
the incidents do know that it's gonna crash a lot if it's on a headless it's

445
0:30:20.880 --> 0:30:23.560
gonna crash a lot you're gonna need to probably like make sure it's got like an

446
0:30:23.560 --> 0:30:26.640
auto-restart or something like that if it's sandbox see as in people can do

447
0:30:26.640 --> 0:30:30.600
whatever they want it will just accidentally crash that won't happen if

448
0:30:30.600 --> 0:30:34.360
like only certain people can build only friends can or a limited audience but

449
0:30:34.360 --> 0:30:39.640
anyone can build the chances of crashing is like it's gonna be higher as for

450
0:30:39.640 --> 0:30:42.760
hosting instances personally if you are a host in the world rather than on a

451
0:30:42.760 --> 0:30:48.680
headless your unfortunate job is to sort of be a gatekeeper of that session if

452
0:30:48.680 --> 0:30:52.600
you notice problems particularly problems involving the guidelines please

453
0:30:52.600 --> 0:30:56.360
enact self-moderation that's where you can sort of kick or ban someone from a

454
0:30:56.360 --> 0:31:00.240
session report stuff that happens we love tickets we're not gonna like

455
0:31:00.240 --> 0:31:05.360
penalize you for making a ticket that isn't good or isn't spelt right or

456
0:31:05.360 --> 0:31:09.120
anything like that if something happens let us know we'll take a look at it but

457
0:31:09.120 --> 0:31:12.320
do remember that like you have a little bit of responsibility as the session

458
0:31:12.320 --> 0:31:16.440
host to kind of keep keep things to how you'd want them to happen imagine that

459
0:31:16.440 --> 0:31:19.520
the session is your house and the people are coming around to visit if someone

460
0:31:19.520 --> 0:31:23.800
comes around to visit and they spread dirt all around the floor or horse me

461
0:31:23.800 --> 0:31:25.840
that was the meaning for the previous one they spread horsemen you're all

462
0:31:25.840 --> 0:31:29.040
around your apartment you've kicked them out the apartment so do the same for

463
0:31:29.040 --> 0:31:33.800
your session please if they come in with a loud obnoxious firearm again you'd

464
0:31:33.800 --> 0:31:36.680
probably call the police and get them arrested so maybe do that in your

465
0:31:36.680 --> 0:31:40.440
session unless it's like a I don't know gun range session in which case hey

466
0:31:40.440 --> 0:31:46.680
fine so next question from is it a set so is it a thesis I'm kind of our shy

467
0:31:46.680 --> 0:31:50.400
for asking questions in a large group being a new players and I think that'll

468
0:31:50.400 --> 0:31:55.240
make my experience best when I finally get into Neos actually um I have a great

469
0:31:55.240 --> 0:31:59.000
example of that which is about attitude so I've seen great attitude from the

470
0:31:59.000 --> 0:32:02.280
people I've recently been helping but in the past I have had a couple of problems

471
0:32:02.280 --> 0:32:05.040
with a little bit of attitude so when I say attitude I don't mean the way that

472
0:32:05.040 --> 0:32:07.480
like a school teacher would tell you like oh you need to have the right

473
0:32:07.480 --> 0:32:11.440
attitude to learn I just mean the right mental model to go into Neos right so

474
0:32:11.440 --> 0:32:15.080
when you go into Neos as a VR chat player or as any other platform player

475
0:32:15.080 --> 0:32:18.440
coming across you're going to sort of try and make a lot of comparisons you're

476
0:32:18.440 --> 0:32:22.920
gonna try and be like well it's like this over on VR see it's like this or

477
0:32:22.920 --> 0:32:26.800
Neos what I want you to do is is try and sort of see beyond that and have

478
0:32:26.800 --> 0:32:32.200
patience and understand that we have a little bit of dust going on right now

479
0:32:32.200 --> 0:32:35.680
you know if I could wear a hard hat I'd probably be wearing a hard hat right so

480
0:32:35.680 --> 0:32:40.440
some stuff is confusing some stuff is unclear some stuff is more complicated

481
0:32:40.440 --> 0:32:43.880
we've got people all around that are gonna help you out look for the the

482
0:32:43.880 --> 0:32:47.040
green icon above anyone's head if you're in an MTC session that they'll probably

483
0:32:47.040 --> 0:32:52.360
be there and then above all else is just like ask questions if you got them like

484
0:32:52.360 --> 0:32:56.360
I will answer the same questions all day if I need to like if it helps you go

485
0:32:56.360 --> 0:32:59.800
through it if you're shy and you don't want to speak using your microphone we

486
0:32:59.800 --> 0:33:03.480
have a number of tools available inside the Neos Essentials folder called the

487
0:33:03.480 --> 0:33:06.680
Mute Helper that lets you type text-based messages which will appear in

488
0:33:06.680 --> 0:33:10.400
a speech bubble next to your head and that's a great sort of advantage to many

489
0:33:10.400 --> 0:33:15.000
many people who are for whatever reason and there's no judgment here don't feel

490
0:33:15.000 --> 0:33:18.600
comfortable talking that's absolutely fine you know was fantastic for that

491
0:33:18.600 --> 0:33:24.480
also remember that everyone had to learn at one point I'm just rambling here if

492
0:33:24.480 --> 0:33:28.680
you like the rambling cool if you don't let me know my first session in Neos I

493
0:33:28.680 --> 0:33:34.120
was in an avatar tool world by a user called business lawyer Nexlin came in

494
0:33:34.120 --> 0:33:39.320
and there was a cart like a sort of metal cart in this world he he'd

495
0:33:39.320 --> 0:33:43.560
selected with the inspector and scaled it I'm just like whoa and I spent the

496
0:33:43.560 --> 0:33:46.360
next like week or so just completely confused I had no idea how anything

497
0:33:46.360 --> 0:33:50.600
worked and so everyone had to learn even me that was like two three years ago but

498
0:33:50.600 --> 0:33:54.360
I everyone has to learn Duff has a statement as well which is be kind ask

499
0:33:54.360 --> 0:33:57.800
questions and know that you're generally in a helpful community yep it's good

500
0:33:57.800 --> 0:34:01.400
advice as well I'll also take a look at the guidelines I hate you know banging a

501
0:34:01.400 --> 0:34:03.720
drum about them but like the guidelines do have some important information

502
0:34:03.720 --> 0:34:08.080
they're good for you as a person just to know what's unacceptable to do but it's

503
0:34:08.080 --> 0:34:12.760
also good for you to know what we value right the guidelines show what Neos

504
0:34:12.760 --> 0:34:17.080
values in a community so we value people being nice to each other because it's on

505
0:34:17.080 --> 0:34:21.360
that guidelines to not be not nice and do again make tickets if you see

506
0:34:21.360 --> 0:34:26.000
problems we love tickets tickets are a great source of substance for us moving

507
0:34:26.000 --> 0:34:29.800
forwards Nash has a question which is how easy would it be in port my avatar

508
0:34:29.800 --> 0:34:33.640
do I just drop in to adapt do I just drag and drop the FBX I've ever done it

509
0:34:33.640 --> 0:34:38.120
before in a lot of cases you are like a little bit ahead of the game because

510
0:34:38.120 --> 0:34:42.200
what we start with usually with with with VRC players or platform players is

511
0:34:42.200 --> 0:34:45.240
they don't know where their FBX is that's perfectly fine if you know where

512
0:34:45.240 --> 0:34:48.320
your FBX is you're already at like step two so you're already having an easier

513
0:34:48.320 --> 0:34:51.760
time then then someone who doesn't know where their FBX is drag and drop your

514
0:34:51.760 --> 0:34:55.640
FBX into the game you've got to click a few buttons it is a little bit of an

515
0:34:55.640 --> 0:34:58.680
evolved process someone can show you it or there are tutorials available which

516
0:34:58.680 --> 0:35:03.080
I'm sure people can sort of point and take a look at gray has linked one for

517
0:35:03.080 --> 0:35:07.240
example just underneath the question and it will import things that might not

518
0:35:07.240 --> 0:35:11.680
work when you import things are things like textures materials and in some

519
0:35:11.680 --> 0:35:15.600
cases as well rigging there are subtle differences between the way that unity

520
0:35:15.600 --> 0:35:19.320
is able to rig a humanoid and Neos is able to rig a humanoid but depending on

521
0:35:19.320 --> 0:35:22.880
which avatar you're using it's absolutely fine I'm gonna take a look at

522
0:35:22.880 --> 0:35:26.120
your profile picture here and assume that she'll be out your avatar if it's

523
0:35:26.120 --> 0:35:32.280
so probably be fine I think I recognize that one from being imported do just

524
0:35:32.280 --> 0:35:36.960
take it slow ask questions and you'll be there it is not impossible people

525
0:35:36.960 --> 0:35:41.360
import all sorts of stuff Corey asks will there ever be will there eventually

526
0:35:41.360 --> 0:35:45.120
be a wiki page and the recommended avatar optimizations yes it's on my list

527
0:35:45.120 --> 0:35:49.800
to write I just don't wanna get it wrong so I am like writing it and editing it

528
0:35:49.800 --> 0:35:55.160
and writing it and editing it and then waiting to send it to fruits or or gains

529
0:35:55.160 --> 0:35:58.360
so gains is our graphics program ideals of all the rendering and fruits just

530
0:35:58.360 --> 0:36:01.960
knows everything about Neos because they wrote a lot of it I want to say like

531
0:36:01.960 --> 0:36:04.760
most of it but these days like it's a little bit untrue because like hey I

532
0:36:04.760 --> 0:36:10.080
write code gains rights code you know it's it's cool they know like a lot

533
0:36:10.080 --> 0:36:14.120
fruits knowledge is insane you just be like this component you wrote three

534
0:36:14.120 --> 0:36:21.480
years ago and they're like oh yeah that one it does this let's move on Corey has

535
0:36:21.480 --> 0:36:24.840
an interesting statement which says it's tedious to import an avatar I agree that

536
0:36:24.840 --> 0:36:28.480
the first few avatars that you import are going to be tedious and that's a bit

537
0:36:28.480 --> 0:36:31.280
that I was talking about with that attitude if you come up with an attitude

538
0:36:31.280 --> 0:36:36.320
of this is tedious I am bored I'm I'm fed up then you won't get it done but

539
0:36:36.320 --> 0:36:39.740
becoming an attitude like hey this is gonna be a bit tedious this might be a

540
0:36:39.740 --> 0:36:44.780
little bit confusing and you get it done they're like four fifth sixth avatar you

541
0:36:44.780 --> 0:36:48.680
import it'll be much easier the first couple they are gonna be a little bit

542
0:36:48.680 --> 0:36:54.740
tedious let's move on does this can we empathize that you can use f8 to swap

543
0:36:54.740 --> 0:36:59.120
between VR and desktop mode assuming you stop yeah I told that to a user

544
0:36:59.120 --> 0:37:04.320
yesterday and they were like mind blown it was crazy to just elaborate that on a

545
0:37:04.320 --> 0:37:08.600
little bit if you start in VR mode that start the game in VR mode right you know

546
0:37:08.600 --> 0:37:12.360
if you use base stations they start wearing your headset turns on you can

547
0:37:12.360 --> 0:37:16.720
just focus the window on your desktop like with your headset off push f8 and

548
0:37:16.720 --> 0:37:21.140
you'll be in desktop mode push f8 again you'll be back in desktop no VR

549
0:37:21.140 --> 0:37:24.960
whichever way around it was that I was talking there is no need to restart if

550
0:37:24.960 --> 0:37:28.820
you start in desktop mode you cannot switch to VR mode you have to start in

551
0:37:28.820 --> 0:37:33.080
VR mode to do that switch myself and many others of the community we always

552
0:37:33.080 --> 0:37:37.200
start in VR mode and there are some days where I started VR mode instantly f8 to

553
0:37:37.200 --> 0:37:41.160
desktop mode and then never f8 back my headsets just like lying there on its

554
0:37:41.160 --> 0:37:45.140
like usual resting spot on my desk and it's just like play with me and I'm

555
0:37:45.140 --> 0:37:53.440
like not today it's like but I'm on like not today I'm f8 let's move along

556
0:37:53.440 --> 0:37:58.000
Lupo says is there any word or timeline for the solve of the issues from anyone

557
0:37:58.000 --> 0:38:01.560
the reason we're not pushing updates it will talk about it in announcements when

558
0:38:01.560 --> 0:38:05.080
we talk about it I said it earlier but like if there is no announcement in

559
0:38:05.080 --> 0:38:08.200
announcements don't assume nothing's happening just assume we can't talk

560
0:38:08.200 --> 0:38:11.960
about it yet and says you've got a lot of people listening to you rabbi about

561
0:38:11.960 --> 0:38:15.520
so these stuff today else took about your door earlier that you're replacing

562
0:38:15.520 --> 0:38:20.240
moving forwards Jin asks is Nia is looking alternative rendering engines

563
0:38:20.240 --> 0:38:28.520
such as web 3js or Godot we are looking into other engines not 3js and not Godot

564
0:38:28.520 --> 0:38:33.400
we were looking into they're all called silly names so I've forgotten them all

565
0:38:33.400 --> 0:38:37.840
all right now we're sort of working on our own rendering engine as a separate

566
0:38:37.840 --> 0:38:43.680
project it's called sauce not sauce the half-life 2 on the sources in like

567
0:38:43.680 --> 0:38:48.480
tomatoes sauce I honestly don't know a lot about it and that's because my

568
0:38:48.480 --> 0:38:52.080
strengths don't allow in the rendering side of things that's more kind of like

569
0:38:52.080 --> 0:38:55.320
easy question to go over gains did used to do office hours they're just sort of

570
0:38:55.320 --> 0:39:03.080
on hold right now but it will not be Godot or 3js or unreal that's like

571
0:39:03.080 --> 0:39:06.640
another common question yet we will not be unreal before it says can we hit

572
0:39:06.640 --> 0:39:09.000
hundred people in primetime I don't know if you can make it happen go for it I'm

573
0:39:09.000 --> 0:39:11.880
too busy scrolling down asking questions I'm looking at my scroll bar it's just

574
0:39:11.880 --> 0:39:18.960
continually going oh let's keep going fuzzy says last I need for Japanese

575
0:39:18.960 --> 0:39:21.720
makers they make amazing things but usually very optimized I've seen some

576
0:39:21.720 --> 0:39:26.920
advancements in that the the biggest part about the the Japanese community

577
0:39:26.920 --> 0:39:29.920
that I like is how fast they are I have no idea how they do it and how fast they

578
0:39:29.920 --> 0:39:33.800
do it they're also incredibly well organized so when they start our project

579
0:39:33.800 --> 0:39:38.440
it just sort of like happens and it's insane and I love that about them and so

580
0:39:38.440 --> 0:39:43.280
there's any optimization issues I'm sure they're working on them Quincy I think I

581
0:39:43.280 --> 0:39:48.680
saw you in nears if I'm remembering that name hello again a translation device

582
0:39:48.680 --> 0:39:54.720
would love to find that where can I get one essential tools essential tools JP

583
0:39:54.720 --> 0:39:59.080
tools and then in there is the translator I don't know which row it's

584
0:39:59.080 --> 0:40:04.800
on or anything like that but you're looking for a red and white rectangle I

585
0:40:04.800 --> 0:40:08.200
know that's not useful and I apologize on behalf of nears that we don't have

586
0:40:08.200 --> 0:40:12.360
search yet but it is in there I do have a version I'm working on that's sort of

587
0:40:12.360 --> 0:40:17.400
working but mine is just an edit and I do have a video about that on my channel

588
0:40:17.400 --> 0:40:20.200
but I do always want to point to the original source as well because they

589
0:40:20.200 --> 0:40:23.080
deserve all the credit they figured it out I just have tweaked it a little bit

590
0:40:23.080 --> 0:40:28.240
to make it easier for my purposes shifty states IK is incredibly optimized more

591
0:40:28.240 --> 0:40:31.280
particularly as minimizing cost of slot transforms in the data model I thought

592
0:40:31.280 --> 0:40:34.640
there was something we want to do out okay I might be out of date yeah anyway

593
0:40:34.640 --> 0:40:37.920
the point there being an optimization is there is stuff that you can do which

594
0:40:37.920 --> 0:40:42.440
will make a wiki page for and there is stuff that the nears team can do which

595
0:40:42.440 --> 0:40:46.520
we need we know that we need to work on so that has another question fantastic

596
0:40:46.520 --> 0:40:51.480
which says Disney is having hard limits in terms of avatars of worlds not that I

597
0:40:51.480 --> 0:40:55.180
can think of there's nothing stopping you from importing a like million

598
0:40:55.180 --> 0:41:00.240
polygon avatar but it will lag people out and they'll hate you for it there's

599
0:41:00.240 --> 0:41:03.280
also nothing stopping you from doing that on the world level and again it

600
0:41:03.280 --> 0:41:05.800
will lag people out and they'll they'll hate it and they won't go there but

601
0:41:05.800 --> 0:41:10.360
there's no real limits the only limit I can really think of is what beyond like

602
0:41:10.360 --> 0:41:14.000
hey your computer might crash is the file space limit that you have all

603
0:41:14.000 --> 0:41:19.840
accounts start with a default storage space of one gigabyte beyond that you

604
0:41:19.840 --> 0:41:26.280
will need to subscribe to our patreon to get more space and that will enable you

605
0:41:26.280 --> 0:41:32.380
to save more I have currently have about 25 gigabytes of space based on my

606
0:41:32.380 --> 0:41:36.340
account status and I'm using like 5% of that and I've been playing for three

607
0:41:36.340 --> 0:41:41.360
years but I don't save everything I I don't know like recently like like half

608
0:41:41.360 --> 0:41:45.600
a year ago or something I just stopped saving stuff that I like I don't I need

609
0:41:45.600 --> 0:41:49.800
like it's cool but I don't need to save it I just remember where it is and then I go

610
0:41:49.800 --> 0:41:53.680
there and spawn it out again or go find it if I need it that way I keep my file

611
0:41:53.680 --> 0:41:57.600
space down and I have really really dense polygon meshes all sorts of stuff

612
0:41:57.600 --> 0:42:02.840
I have a really really high high density chicken nugget which has an amazing

613
0:42:02.840 --> 0:42:05.600
story about it

614
0:42:06.320 --> 0:42:11.440
speedy baby another crate username here I like these these strange strange like

615
0:42:11.440 --> 0:42:16.240
usernames ever ring to them they're good they ask what accessibility things are

616
0:42:16.240 --> 0:42:19.760
in the game so it depends what type of accessibility you're talking about I'm

617
0:42:19.760 --> 0:42:24.480
happy to go into specifics if you have a particular thing in mind that you're

618
0:42:24.480 --> 0:42:29.120
you're concerned about ones that come to mind are the mute help which I mentioned

619
0:42:29.120 --> 0:42:32.840
before that's for users who for whatever reason again no judgment from me don't

620
0:42:32.840 --> 0:42:35.720
wish to speak they can use the mute helper to have that speech bubble appear

621
0:42:35.720 --> 0:42:38.800
next to the messages that they type there are various versions of the

622
0:42:38.800 --> 0:42:41.880
help there's even one that's sort of hooked up to text-to-speech so that the

623
0:42:41.880 --> 0:42:45.880
message that you type will then be read in game using a text-to-speech voice and

624
0:42:45.880 --> 0:42:49.560
text-to-speech is getting a great right now I know text-to-speech has a sort of

625
0:42:49.560 --> 0:42:53.240
reputation in the older days of computing as being very robotic but I've

626
0:42:53.240 --> 0:42:58.040
seen some text-to-speech on those avatars which is quite human beyond that

627
0:42:58.040 --> 0:43:05.120
if you are colorblind I'm partially colorblind we do have a way to correct

628
0:43:05.120 --> 0:43:09.440
for that it is a little bit experimental but there are filters that you can put

629
0:43:09.440 --> 0:43:12.760
on your head that's sort of like a material you put on your head and they

630
0:43:12.760 --> 0:43:15.680
can adjust the color spectrum of a world such that it might be a little bit

631
0:43:15.680 --> 0:43:19.660
better you know we can make blues more blues or less blue whatever whatever you

632
0:43:19.660 --> 0:43:23.800
need there if you are light sensitive I know that a couple of people like

633
0:43:23.800 --> 0:43:26.400
sensitive we can also do the same thing as that colorblind filter but with a

634
0:43:26.400 --> 0:43:30.000
darkening filter right it'll just take some of the intensity of the bright

635
0:43:30.000 --> 0:43:34.120
lights out of the world I have some glasses in my inventory which I very

636
0:43:34.120 --> 0:43:37.280
rarely equipped these days and I don't really know why I used to equip them all

637
0:43:37.280 --> 0:43:45.840
the time in the early days moving beyond color if you are low vision there is the

638
0:43:45.840 --> 0:43:49.160
ability to just arbitrarily create cameras in the world and I've seen a lot

639
0:43:49.160 --> 0:43:52.960
of people who will I don't know where they are if anyone in chat is here and

640
0:43:52.960 --> 0:43:55.480
there is where they are they've got sort of devices they parent to their avatar

641
0:43:55.480 --> 0:43:59.320
that let them kind of zoom in on things a little bit like or similar to Windows

642
0:43:59.320 --> 0:44:06.680
magnifier so I like seeing those we also have on that note we have disability

643
0:44:06.680 --> 0:44:10.440
awareness badges which you can add to your account if someone below can link

644
0:44:10.440 --> 0:44:15.080
the badges with the article we have a badge that says that you're colorblind

645
0:44:15.080 --> 0:44:19.360
we have a badge that says that you are have vision issues we also have a badge

646
0:44:19.360 --> 0:44:24.920
that says that you are deaf when it comes to the deaf community there we

647
0:44:24.920 --> 0:44:28.860
have a lot of techniques and abilities that you can do in there we also have a

648
0:44:28.860 --> 0:44:33.560
prominent few people that are in that community and are fantastic Danny comes

649
0:44:33.560 --> 0:44:38.880
to mind Danny is fantastic they make just crazy stuff with the finger

650
0:44:38.880 --> 0:44:42.880
tracking that we have and the leap motion support that we have we see a lot

651
0:44:42.880 --> 0:44:46.840
of people that are able to sign a lot better inside Neos because they can just

652
0:44:46.840 --> 0:44:50.520
sort of you know move their hands around we also have a couple of sort of hands

653
0:44:50.520 --> 0:44:55.200
that are set up such that you can manually trigger letter fingerspelling

654
0:44:55.200 --> 0:45:02.220
signs in a sort of intuitive way we also have native subtitle support for videos

655
0:45:02.220 --> 0:45:06.120
although I don't know how it works is on my list to make a tutorial about but I

656
0:45:06.120 --> 0:45:09.040
was reading code earlier and I'm like oh yeah you can import subtitle files I

657
0:45:09.040 --> 0:45:14.720
forgot how but you can and those can be hooked up beyond that though because I

658
0:45:14.720 --> 0:45:19.960
could wear on for forever literally if there is a problem you might be able to

659
0:45:19.960 --> 0:45:26.000
build something to fix that problem and people will love to help you like if you

660
0:45:26.000 --> 0:45:31.440
go into a world and you say I am for whatever reason I am unable to

661
0:45:31.440 --> 0:45:35.440
comprehend the existence of yellow like someone will quickly build you something

662
0:45:35.440 --> 0:45:38.960
you can put on your head and it just removes yellow somehow so much he handed

663
0:45:38.960 --> 0:45:41.960
me there yesterday when I was playing they handed me some glasses that gave

664
0:45:41.960 --> 0:45:46.760
you the vision of a dog right so they remove the colors that dogs cannot see

665
0:45:46.760 --> 0:45:51.440
and so if I looked at green grass for example it was actually yellow my color

666
0:45:51.440 --> 0:45:53.960
blindness means that I can often not tell the difference between green and

667
0:45:53.960 --> 0:45:58.120
yellow anyway so I was very confused I'm like this isn't any different and they're

668
0:45:58.120 --> 0:46:01.440
like are you a dog no I'm not a dog I just can't tell the difference between

669
0:46:01.440 --> 0:46:06.120
green and yellow sometimes moving forwards

670
0:46:06.120 --> 0:46:10.440
Zillowsef has another question here which says what is the most difficult

671
0:46:10.440 --> 0:46:15.040
thing that new players will have to deal with people have commented with emojis

672
0:46:15.040 --> 0:46:20.320
to get logics and I would kind of agree but I would actually say is getting the

673
0:46:20.320 --> 0:46:25.120
avatar imported the thing that like is is difficult about particularly people

674
0:46:25.120 --> 0:46:28.400
that come from another platform that doesn't have the in editing ability is

675
0:46:28.400 --> 0:46:33.320
you want to just get comfortable and I used to not understand this but after

676
0:46:33.320 --> 0:46:35.840
like a month or two of playing VR I got it right people want to feel

677
0:46:35.840 --> 0:46:38.920
comfortable in the avatar that they're wearing getting to that stage where

678
0:46:38.920 --> 0:46:41.640
you're comfortable is going to be the most difficult part that's why you've

679
0:46:41.640 --> 0:46:44.740
got an avatar that you're comfortable in it's moving correctly it looks

680
0:46:44.740 --> 0:46:48.100
correct it's got your colors your textures on it and when you look in the

681
0:46:48.100 --> 0:46:51.360
mirror you're like that's me once that's done that's probably the most difficult

682
0:46:51.360 --> 0:46:55.440
hurdle and then beyond that it's up to you about what you want to do again like

683
0:46:55.440 --> 0:46:58.060
I see people have said logics if you don't want to learn logics that's

684
0:46:58.060 --> 0:47:01.560
totally fine you don't have to if you don't want to learn any of the engine

685
0:47:01.560 --> 0:47:05.320
that's totally fine just get the avatar in ask for help and and you'll get it in

686
0:47:05.320 --> 0:47:09.460
and then you can just socialize right so it just depends on which path or journey

687
0:47:09.460 --> 0:47:13.660
that you want to go through on Neos. Slinkah says ET controller the one with

688
0:47:13.660 --> 0:47:18.280
the driver already Neos yes the driver in Neos for ET controllers is like

689
0:47:18.280 --> 0:47:23.040
really old it's from before they had six doff now they have a six doff version

690
0:47:23.040 --> 0:47:27.120
which is the right image on the thumbnail from the link that Alex posted

691
0:47:27.120 --> 0:47:30.880
it's got like a chunkier bit attached to it which is basically like a five

692
0:47:30.880 --> 0:47:35.320
tracker but a neti version of that that's six doff six degrees of freedom

693
0:47:35.320 --> 0:47:38.080
that means and that might mean there's an updated driver and if there's an

694
0:47:38.080 --> 0:47:42.580
updated driver would have to edit that. Aaron says does Neos currently spot any

695
0:47:42.580 --> 0:47:46.640
haptic gloves I believe we support the B haptics gloves those just give you

696
0:47:46.640 --> 0:47:50.120
vibration feedback on the gloves they don't give you the haptics that I

697
0:47:50.120 --> 0:47:53.880
believe you're talking about which is where you can like feel stuff in VR

698
0:47:53.880 --> 0:47:57.560
speaking of feeling stuff does anyone remember the Novant Falcon if you

699
0:47:57.560 --> 0:48:00.720
remember the Novant Falcon let me know there's any Novant Falcon remember is

700
0:48:00.720 --> 0:48:03.520
let me know you don't know what it is you can go ahead and take a look at it

701
0:48:03.520 --> 0:48:08.160
moving onwards Traderos hope I'm pronouncing that correctly another

702
0:48:08.160 --> 0:48:11.520
interesting name is there currently any estimate of time frames when the key

703
0:48:11.520 --> 0:48:15.480
updates would be applied or would there be some way to see updates on current

704
0:48:15.480 --> 0:48:18.540
systems in the works although I generally do not like products and

705
0:48:18.540 --> 0:48:21.160
services to be crushed the current state of the market is very competitive and

706
0:48:21.160 --> 0:48:24.560
falling behind becomes problematic we are very aware of that there are lots of

707
0:48:24.560 --> 0:48:26.680
things in progress here the announcements channel I don't want to

708
0:48:26.680 --> 0:48:29.720
sort of dwell on that too much that our existing that are preventing us from

709
0:48:29.720 --> 0:48:33.440
doing updates beyond that though I would encourage you to go look at our roadmap

710
0:48:33.440 --> 0:48:38.800
on github if someone wants to drop the roadmap link in the in the chat that

711
0:48:38.800 --> 0:48:41.960
would be great that shows you what we are working on or at least intending to

712
0:48:41.960 --> 0:48:45.040
work on and also gives you our backlog which is large but it shows you that

713
0:48:45.040 --> 0:48:48.480
we're thinking about stuff we want to feed back in each of those items as well

714
0:48:48.480 --> 0:48:51.920
if there is a job issue that you found that you have and it's something to say

715
0:48:51.920 --> 0:48:55.380
about comment on us let us know let us know how you feel let us know what you

716
0:48:55.380 --> 0:49:00.360
want to see in that future double stick says it's called dynamic bone no s by

717
0:49:00.360 --> 0:49:05.020
will Hong that's the original thing yeah yeah I'd like to meet will Hong make you

718
0:49:05.020 --> 0:49:09.320
say like hey how much like did you buy a house with about money you may I don't

719
0:49:09.320 --> 0:49:15.340
know like yeah we have some love for EDF fantastic EDF is earth defense force is

720
0:49:15.340 --> 0:49:18.840
a very crazy game and if you have a chance to play it please go ahead and do

721
0:49:18.840 --> 0:49:24.280
and just like roll into the hilarity EDF is amazing egg roll face says I they

722
0:49:24.280 --> 0:49:26.720
might have worded that probably because I was playing a hosting an instance I

723
0:49:26.720 --> 0:49:30.000
would have to scroll up and find that question if you have a further up

724
0:49:30.000 --> 0:49:34.120
question about hosting an instance do let me know spec says can you explain

725
0:49:34.120 --> 0:49:36.880
for news is how to stop an avatar for face tracking so long as the blend ships

726
0:49:36.880 --> 0:49:39.920
already exist yes when you create an avatar there's a bunch of check boxes on

727
0:49:39.920 --> 0:49:43.560
the right hand on the like middle of the avatar credit just check them all I know

728
0:49:43.560 --> 0:49:46.160
some of them are off by default I don't really know why just check them all

729
0:49:46.160 --> 0:49:49.440
they're all useful one of them will automatically set up face tracking that

730
0:49:49.440 --> 0:49:53.880
works at the HTC Vive face tracker I have one of those stuck to my face on my

731
0:49:53.880 --> 0:49:57.420
headset and it makes me sometimes look really weird because my eyebrows do

732
0:49:57.420 --> 0:50:04.140
wiggles but like that's fine for the face tracker itself it is based on the

733
0:50:04.140 --> 0:50:08.120
blend shape definitions which we got from HTC in the tutorials channel of

734
0:50:08.120 --> 0:50:12.780
this discord pinned is an image by gabell who made the sort of pivotal

735
0:50:12.780 --> 0:50:16.560
example face tracking avatar which has all of those blend shapes set up you

736
0:50:16.560 --> 0:50:20.160
don't have to name them exactly like that image if you have blend shapes that

737
0:50:20.160 --> 0:50:24.300
are close enough then you could hook them up to the facial tracker I have a

738
0:50:24.300 --> 0:50:26.320
video on that on my channel if someone could go ahead and make that that'd be

739
0:50:26.320 --> 0:50:31.040
great as an example here many avatars have a smile blend shape and it's named

740
0:50:31.040 --> 0:50:34.640
whatever it's named sometimes it's even named in Japanese you can hook that up

741
0:50:34.640 --> 0:50:40.080
to the smile face tracker preset and it'll work even if it's not named

742
0:50:40.080 --> 0:50:45.400
correctly and just that just having a smile adds so much more like emotion to

743
0:50:45.400 --> 0:50:51.680
an avatar that you're wearing okay we're still my scroll bar is still huge let's

744
0:50:51.680 --> 0:50:54.880
keep going I will answer all questions I know it's a little bit of a crazy day so

745
0:50:54.880 --> 0:51:00.040
I'll just keep going till we run out of questions no user found welcome to the

746
0:51:00.040 --> 0:51:04.440
discord I see you a new from the plant icon like meant to be like a flower I

747
0:51:04.440 --> 0:51:08.080
don't know it's a plant icon who asked how is the crypto stuff incorporated the

748
0:51:08.080 --> 0:51:12.000
game and are certain avatars what locked behind NFTs or crypto nothing is locked

749
0:51:12.000 --> 0:51:16.120
behind NFTs or crypto at all there might be some community products which you

750
0:51:16.120 --> 0:51:19.520
have to buy using crypto but that's nothing to do with us that's the same

751
0:51:19.520 --> 0:51:24.320
thing as buying an avatar off gumroad and then importing into nius we have no

752
0:51:24.320 --> 0:51:28.120
worlds locked behind crypto or NFTs if you're asking about crypto being

753
0:51:28.120 --> 0:51:31.640
integrated in the game the steam build has no crypto and functionality the non

754
0:51:31.640 --> 0:51:37.080
steam build does in the non steam build you can deposit our currency and CR into

755
0:51:37.080 --> 0:51:41.840
your in-game wallet and withdraw it you can send it to people and you can buy

756
0:51:41.840 --> 0:51:47.360
storage with it that's it yeah moving on good questions today mr. Aaron Aaron's a

757
0:51:47.360 --> 0:51:51.360
good friend of mine he says what are your opinions on the recent influx of

758
0:51:51.360 --> 0:51:56.720
people and how it affect non-time news I am a bit puzzled about what might happen

759
0:51:56.720 --> 0:52:02.080
long term for anyone here that's new I love having you here as just the rest of

760
0:52:02.080 --> 0:52:05.640
our community we love helping you I just I don't know what's gonna happen in the

761
0:52:05.640 --> 0:52:11.520
future like well VRC reverse their decision to add EAC if VRC does that how

762
0:52:11.520 --> 0:52:15.600
many of you will stay I don't know and that's the bit like I'm unsure about I

763
0:52:15.600 --> 0:52:19.880
would love it if all of you stay I understand the that might not be

764
0:52:19.880 --> 0:52:23.160
realistic so if you choose not to stay that's totally fine thank you so much

765
0:52:23.160 --> 0:52:28.080
for trying us and hope to see you back time some there sometime soon I'm

766
0:52:28.080 --> 0:52:33.280
running out of English at the moment as to what I think about it is great it's

767
0:52:33.280 --> 0:52:37.680
also unexpected I wish we'd had some notice it's a bit difficult for VRC to

768
0:52:37.680 --> 0:52:41.600
basically be like yo we're dropping a big update you might get some users

769
0:52:41.600 --> 0:52:44.460
because they're gonna hate it like that they wouldn't do that that's not like a

770
0:52:44.460 --> 0:52:49.560
business thing that exists but it is unexpected like I had other plans for

771
0:52:49.560 --> 0:52:54.480
this week but I guess they're kind of like thrown out let's go ahead and move

772
0:52:54.480 --> 0:52:59.280
on see if any more questions is it there says I so I'm thinking this is the

773
0:52:59.280 --> 0:53:03.600
official VRC killer no I disagree um the important thing to think about and we

774
0:53:03.600 --> 0:53:06.800
encourage you to do this based on the guidelines channel of this discord is to

775
0:53:06.800 --> 0:53:11.240
think about how think about the the metaverse platforms is like a family

776
0:53:11.240 --> 0:53:14.620
right we should be getting along we should be talking to each other we

777
0:53:14.620 --> 0:53:18.680
should be sharing insights I myself am friends with the head of trust and

778
0:53:18.680 --> 0:53:22.160
safety at VR chat and I sent them some kind words yesterday I didn't like say

779
0:53:22.160 --> 0:53:26.680
hey this is a bad decision or anything like that I just said hey good luck I

780
0:53:26.680 --> 0:53:30.840
basically I read the update and I just said hey good luck you know let me know

781
0:53:30.840 --> 0:53:33.280
if you need anything because like I know that they probably had a really really

782
0:53:33.280 --> 0:53:37.040
tiresome day yesterday and that's the kind of dialogue that I want between

783
0:53:37.040 --> 0:53:40.680
those platforms so it's I don't think it's appropriate to say one is better

784
0:53:40.680 --> 0:53:43.480
than the other I think it's appropriate to say that they are different and that

785
0:53:43.480 --> 0:53:47.920
they have different uses you'll see that sentiment a lot from people you also see

786
0:53:47.920 --> 0:53:52.040
the opposite sentiment which is like no this is better than VRC no VRC is better

787
0:53:52.040 --> 0:53:55.200
than this and like it's not my place to comment on that because I don't think we

788
0:53:55.200 --> 0:53:59.480
should be coming on it a good way to think about it is how you think about

789
0:53:59.480 --> 0:54:03.880
beverages food and stuff like that like the Pepsi Coca-Cola thing right you guys

790
0:54:03.880 --> 0:54:06.800
have a preference we don't need to talk about it we'll start an argument but you

791
0:54:06.800 --> 0:54:10.400
have a preference that's in your mind right now Pepsi or Coca-Cola but if

792
0:54:10.400 --> 0:54:15.440
they're sold out of Pepsi or Coca-Cola in the grocery store you're gonna buy

793
0:54:15.440 --> 0:54:19.440
the other one and you're gonna enjoy it so it's a matter of preference rather

794
0:54:19.440 --> 0:54:25.960
than like a clear-cut distinction between the two platforms let's move on

795
0:54:25.960 --> 0:54:29.680
llama with two L's hope I'm pronouncing that correctly welcome to the discord

796
0:54:29.680 --> 0:54:33.000
is there any plan to add a reset password button to the web UI the

797
0:54:33.000 --> 0:54:35.200
person's a little confusing you should converge the login to the website you

798
0:54:35.200 --> 0:54:39.720
can't reset your password about being in game and I find a little clunky yes we

799
0:54:39.720 --> 0:54:43.280
have like three websites it's problematic but we're doing our best

800
0:54:43.280 --> 0:54:48.520
we're you know like I said we're working on stuff so we have the the main website

801
0:54:48.520 --> 0:54:51.760
and that has all the information about it and then we have like the account

802
0:54:51.760 --> 0:54:55.280
website and then we have a third account website which is what we're trying to

803
0:54:55.280 --> 0:54:57.960
move everything over to I believe that actually has a reset part of

804
0:54:57.960 --> 0:55:02.120
functionality on it it's just not like it doesn't really do anything other than

805
0:55:02.120 --> 0:55:05.120
account right it's stuff so that might be an option to do that but we

806
0:55:05.120 --> 0:55:08.920
absolutely have plans to sort of put that all together like a jigsaw puzzle

807
0:55:08.920 --> 0:55:13.100
until it makes sense in the future Nash has updated their profile picture so I

808
0:55:13.100 --> 0:55:15.560
can see their avatar a little better yeah that looks like it will work quite

809
0:55:15.560 --> 0:55:23.080
well great let's move along egg roll fails again hope if you're fighting for

810
0:55:23.080 --> 0:55:26.600
the EDF quite well anyway also is there someplace where there's a complete list

811
0:55:26.600 --> 0:55:29.680
of desktop controls it seems the only one I can find is outdated wiki has it

812
0:55:29.680 --> 0:55:32.240
the wiki shouldn't be out of date if it's out of date yell at me I'll update

813
0:55:32.240 --> 0:55:36.480
it basic controls is the page on the Wikipedia on the not the Wikipedia the

814
0:55:36.480 --> 0:55:41.640
Neos wiki moving forwards Aaron says what are some suggestions for getting VRC

815
0:55:41.640 --> 0:55:46.080
users who may be on the fence or simply just trend follows to stay on these I

816
0:55:46.080 --> 0:55:51.720
think we can do that based on the way that we handle the experience right so

817
0:55:51.720 --> 0:55:55.040
if you come over to us to try us out thank you so much for trying us and if

818
0:55:55.040 --> 0:55:59.240
you like it stay do make sure you give it a good try do make sure you come in

819
0:55:59.240 --> 0:56:02.480
with attitude of like hey this might be a little bit difficult there are some

820
0:56:02.480 --> 0:56:07.040
rough edges give it a try let us know what you think and if you don't decide

821
0:56:07.040 --> 0:56:12.080
to stay that's fine thank you for trying moving on we've got delirious Jax's one

822
0:56:12.080 --> 0:56:16.360
minute avatar I love that so delirious Jax's woman avatar is meant to be

823
0:56:16.360 --> 0:56:20.880
slightly satirical and the reason why that is he has a perfect avatar set up

824
0:56:20.880 --> 0:56:24.860
the textures import the IK is fine so you can just import that model and do

825
0:56:24.860 --> 0:56:28.000
that and the reason why he's able to do that is because he knows what Neos needs

826
0:56:28.000 --> 0:56:32.920
and he's able to craft an FBX file that works perfectly a lot of users this

827
0:56:32.920 --> 0:56:36.920
might be the first time that you've even looked at the files inside your avatar

828
0:56:36.920 --> 0:56:40.200
you might have been doing solely with like download drops of unity packages

829
0:56:40.200 --> 0:56:44.760
from avatar creators and that's totally fine like if you are a knowledgeable

830
0:56:44.760 --> 0:56:50.760
user like Jax there should be able to just make an FBX that works I had that

831
0:56:50.760 --> 0:56:55.600
actually yesterday with null user they brought the avatar in and the like rig

832
0:56:55.600 --> 0:56:59.480
was just messed up and I explained what was wrong and I apologize that you know

833
0:56:59.480 --> 0:57:02.880
there was no way to fix it in game and they went oh it's okay I can fix in

834
0:57:02.880 --> 0:57:06.000
blender they took off their headset crumpled into a heap on the floor came

835
0:57:06.000 --> 0:57:09.960
back five minutes later with a working file and it was beautiful I'm like my

836
0:57:09.960 --> 0:57:12.800
job is done baby they understood my statement and they did it

837
0:57:12.800 --> 0:57:16.200
Zillow says says what is the history of Neos had it will start I'm gonna bridge

838
0:57:16.200 --> 0:57:19.160
this some people might have some links if you've got some links to better

839
0:57:19.160 --> 0:57:22.200
histories of that but I'm gonna bridge it because I don't want to go on too

840
0:57:22.200 --> 0:57:28.760
long Fruxius is an original backer of the original oculus rift and when they

841
0:57:28.760 --> 0:57:33.040
got the oculus rift they went to a lot of like meetups like you know hacker

842
0:57:33.040 --> 0:57:38.560
meetups stuff like that jams stuff like that and they created a bunch of cool

843
0:57:38.560 --> 0:57:41.440
stuff and they noticed that they were doing the same thing over and over again

844
0:57:41.440 --> 0:57:45.560
when you start a new VR project what's the first thing you do you make hands

845
0:57:45.560 --> 0:57:49.160
the hands work and then maybe once you've got hands you do grabbing like

846
0:57:49.160 --> 0:57:52.920
think about all the VR games you have they all have hands and grabbing and you

847
0:57:52.920 --> 0:57:57.040
might have to grab a gun or a ball or an object and he was getting tired of

848
0:57:57.040 --> 0:58:00.420
repeatedly doing that he's like I've just started a new project I've got a

849
0:58:00.420 --> 0:58:04.260
copy this code from the other project that sets up hands into this new project

850
0:58:04.260 --> 0:58:07.680
that sets up hands and so originally he was like what if I made the project

851
0:58:07.680 --> 0:58:11.960
project which was Neos and it's like cool now I can make my other projects in

852
0:58:11.960 --> 0:58:16.620
Neos and then it was like well now I can have multiplayer and this collaboration

853
0:58:16.620 --> 0:58:20.640
and people could join and talk to me and it's like well now we have avatars and

854
0:58:20.640 --> 0:58:24.800
then slowly it sort of evolved into a social metaverse but with that also

855
0:58:24.800 --> 0:58:29.640
creation around as a metaverse that's how it all got started specs has a good

856
0:58:29.640 --> 0:58:33.980
point there which is the first time that they imported a VRC avatar they found it

857
0:58:33.980 --> 0:58:37.760
tedious I agree I was completely confused I'd not done unity much before

858
0:58:37.760 --> 0:58:42.200
so I was just like what are all these buttons as well as for Neos they say but

859
0:58:42.200 --> 0:58:46.920
now if he had to choose he would start with Neos because it's simpler and I

860
0:58:46.920 --> 0:58:50.520
agree that's the thing as well if the roles were reversed if you were coming

861
0:58:50.520 --> 0:58:55.560
over to me and I was representative of VR chat and you just you know hopped over

862
0:58:55.560 --> 0:59:00.240
from Neos and I'm like hi welcome to VRC to set up an avatar you need to do the

863
0:59:00.240 --> 0:59:03.720
process that you do for VRC avatar set up you might have the same feedback you

864
0:59:03.720 --> 0:59:06.720
might have the same feedback this is tedious this is confusing and that's

865
0:59:06.720 --> 0:59:09.840
again all about the attitude if you come over naturally if it's confusing you're

866
0:59:09.840 --> 0:59:12.960
gonna have a bad time if you come in the attitude of I'm going to try this I

867
0:59:12.960 --> 0:59:16.760
might get confused I'm gonna ask for help then you'll have a much better

868
0:59:16.760 --> 0:59:20.960
time so Akki Adachi says when will we get the an option to stay logged in

869
0:59:20.960 --> 0:59:24.520
forever that is a colon problem that we have we're only able to remember your

870
0:59:24.520 --> 0:59:29.120
login for seven days due to security and that what that means is if you log in

871
0:59:29.120 --> 0:59:33.240
we'll remember you for seven days and that's like a rolling window so if I

872
0:59:33.240 --> 0:59:38.480
log in today it will remember me till next Tuesday if I log in on Wednesday or

873
0:59:38.480 --> 0:59:41.320
remember you need to next Wednesday so if I continue to log in each day I'll

874
0:59:41.320 --> 0:59:44.520
never have to I'll never have to enter my password again and as I use Neos a

875
0:59:44.520 --> 0:59:48.400
lot I never really have to but we're unable to remember you for forever

876
0:59:48.400 --> 0:59:53.480
because of our security policies we may change that in the future but it just

877
0:59:53.480 --> 0:59:58.880
requires us to sort of evaluate the security problems with that and and

878
0:59:58.880 --> 1:00:03.040
adjust them moving forwards Alex's is there a patreon in fact yes you can

879
1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:06.840
technically make a world which is only accessible to patrons I have no idea if

880
1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:10.520
anyone's done that or why you might do that Lexis that there should be a hard

881
1:00:10.520 --> 1:00:14.260
limit yeah okay we'll sit a hard limit we'll say a hard limit for for quarter

882
1:00:14.260 --> 1:00:16.920
past I would say ten past but we're already like four minutes quarter past

883
1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:19.680
we'll say a hard limit for quarter past you're right I do have other stuff to do

884
1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:24.680
today um Zilla says is the game enjoyable without getting any

885
1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:28.920
subscription yes provided you only upload your avatar and you are wary on

886
1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:34.640
what you save absolutely absolutely don't be a pack rat nowhere stuff is

887
1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:39.760
rather than than saving it as well so if you have a public folder full of cool

888
1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:43.040
stuff that someone else has saved cool that won't count to your storage space

889
1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:46.920
and you can just spawn it if you want to just chill out and and see yourself more

890
1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:52.080
as sort of like a chill out not the platform just a person who chills out on

891
1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:55.000
social VR then all you need is your avatar uploaded you can do everything

892
1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:59.600
that you've ever done on VR chat without a subscription for sure if you want to

893
1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:03.720
build stuff you will maybe at some point run into that up where there's a you

894
1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:07.760
know hey you're out of storage space but if you're careful there's a lot that you

895
1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:11.560
can do about running out of storage space Zilla says so wait is all the

896
1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:14.760
storage in the cloud yes all storage is in the cloud for the most part there is

897
1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:20.920
a caveat to that which is not used a lot when you open Neos you'll see that two

898
1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:24.440
worlds opened you can close these there's ways to do it I'm going to that

899
1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:28.320
by default two worlds opened there is the local home and the cloud home

900
1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:32.840
anything saved to the local home as in saved inside the local home you drop it

901
1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:36.280
in there you hit save will be saved on your computer it doesn't touch the cloud

902
1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:39.680
anything saved anywhere else including your imagery will be saved to the cloud

903
1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:46.000
it is also sort of slightly higgledy-piggledy magic saved to your

904
1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.240
computer that's just a local cache of it a local database of it and a local copy

905
1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:57.800
of it but it is saved to the cloud as well I'm forgetting all the way down to

906
1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:01.720
all the links I requested thank you froppy for linking badges thanks June for

907
1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:10.720
linking that mod for the zooming in beautiful by the way yo we do support

908
1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:17.760
odds we have a modding policy and the modding community are upholding that

909
1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:21.560
policy to a better level than I believe even I can like they are basically like

910
1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:24.680
guys if you're being malicious with your mods get out of here like they won't

911
1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:29.240
help you and all sorts of stuff like that I really do like them

912
1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:32.880
well it's don't break the guidelines read that modern plug-in policy also

913
1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:35.200
read our security policy because it's very important that you read all the

914
1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:38.520
policies we have I wrote the part of the modern plug-in policy I also wrote this

915
1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:43.520
is the security policy so just I'm kind of proud of them anyway moving on

916
1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:47.200
zilla says now is there a roadmap for this yes you can find a roadmap on

917
1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:54.120
github someone can link it froppy did thank you no user found says they don't

918
1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:57.360
worry about force crypto NFT why the crypto stock prices and telegram and

919
1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:03.880
also the nearest metaverse website read announcements moving onwards okay no

920
1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:12.640
more questions specs links an issue great lego creator is asking about low

921
1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.840

924
1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:29.120
I remember this user hello vision but I will direct message a user I'm aware of

925
1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:32.880
and ask for their permission to connect you two together because I know that

926
1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:36.520
they have a lot of tools on their avatar and I'm sure if I ask them politely

927
1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:43.200
enough they'll be happy to show to show you how they got set up so they feel

928
1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:46.600
sorry for asking so don't worry about it if it was a problem if I needed to go

929
1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:51.440
if my house is on fire I would I would I would quit it I would just get rid of it

930
1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:55.280
okay I'm not seeing questions I'm seeing a lot of responses to questions that's

931
1:03:55.280 --> 1:04:00.520
fine see a lot of links to videos face tracker setups excellent videos great

932
1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:04.840
Quincy says speaking of which can people make shops or on the earth to sell

933
1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:09.560
avatars and worlds yes absolutely we actually had I forget I'm so sorry I

934
1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:13.400
forget which furry convention it was but they had the equivalent of the the

935
1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:17.800
dealers den or the like the show floor area as a world and you could go in

936
1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:21.380
there and each person had like a market stall with a hyperlink that could be

937
1:04:21.380 --> 1:04:24.560
on there and that allowed them basically say like hey here's a sample of my

938
1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:27.920
artwork click here it'll take you to their their Commission page stuff like

939
1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:32.600
that you could also do if you set up commissions correctly you could also do

940
1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:36.600
a few demo worlds to demo avatars that wouldn't be like entirely secure like

941
1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:39.520
you know cuz you're still risking it by giving them the avatar to to where but

942
1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:46.580
you won't be able to save it you could do that you can also use Neos on your

943
1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:49.940
like gumroad pages or whatever to be like hey look here's a video of my

944
1:04:49.940 --> 1:04:56.060
avatar in Neos look how expressive it is look at how you know the face tracker

945
1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:59.720
works the dynamic bones work you know that's fine how did I end up scrolling

946
1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:04.380
up I don't particularly know I just like read another question I'm like what

947
1:05:04.380 --> 1:05:13.320
llama kelex bit kyun thank you for letting us know let's try and keep VRC

948
1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:19.560
discussion about that breaking news not here or be here forever it is not a

960
1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:13.800
sure the Neos modding community won't be offended by this is do check Neos's

961
1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:18.160
features before you start modding there are a lot of mods that you you think you

962
1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:22.840
might need because you're coming from a different platform that you don't need

963
1:06:22.840 --> 1:06:28.680
good example there being like grabbing other people's bones before the fist

964
1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:33.880

965
1:06:33.880 --> 1:06:37.360
need that over here so you wouldn't need to mock that so do just take a look at

966
1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:41.160
Neos's features before you then get all sort of embroidered in the modding

967
1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:44.880
community there are a lot of cool mods there but you might not need any is what

976
1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:20.840
furry convention but like for Prime's brain it just is like they all get
