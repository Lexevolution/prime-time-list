1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Welcome to Office Hours, it is 4pm so we're going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 As a reminder, if you have any questions to ask us, please go ahead and drop them in the prime time thread,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 which is a couple of channels up in the Office Hours text channel.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Before we get onto questions, I do have a couple of sort of announcement-y things,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 something new for Office Hours going forwards whenever I remember to do it, of course.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 So getting started, first of all, it is MMC. MMC starts tomorrow.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 You can start making your creations from 2pm Eastern Time, 4am Japanese Standard Time, I think that's JST, and then UTC 1900.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Lots of people forget this, and it can technically cause disqualifications, so make sure you're starting at 2pm Eastern Time.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 There is a post in the MMC channel which has a camera time, also a timestamp-y thing to let you know when you can start.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 We do it at that because it's difficult otherwise because it's an international competition.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So that's that.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Secondarily, and only when I have something of note, I will mention it in this case, but I'm going to do a shout-out of the week.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 It's not going to be every week, but I'm going to do a shout-out of the week this week.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So a shout-out of the week this week goes to... let me just make sure I get the name correct.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I did have it on my notes, but I have lost my notes.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Yes, Amber in the Discord, who made a tutorial on refhacking.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I talk about refhacking a lot as being things to avoid, but things to avoid doesn't mean don't share the knowledge.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So they made a tutorial on refhacking, it's in the tutorials channel, go ahead and read it.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 If you're not sure what refhacking is, it's the ability to peek into the internals of Neos and how we store data structures in Neos

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 and get a hacky way of doing component editing and component property reading.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 It is good that there is information out there about how to do it, but do remember it is on the things to avoid list.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Certainly don't treat anyone negatively for the fact that they are talking about that or giving tutorial information about that.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 It is perfectly fine to use, you just need to know that it is not supported and it will break at a certain date.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 That I don't know by the way, but it will break at some point.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 It can also be used for malicious users, but is not inherently malicious.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So if you notice anyone breaching guidelines using refhacking or not using refhacking, just in general,

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 you can report them at moderation.neos.com where the moderation team will take care of it.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 With announcements out of the way, I'll go ahead and get started with questions that we have.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 So first of all, we have a question from Tiki who says

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 "I copied a world to make it local on the headless and for some reason each time I copied the world,

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 roles permissions are completely reset so everyone was adamant. Is there an easy fix to reset roles to default?"

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 No, there isn't an easy way to do that. There is a GitHub issue open on that,

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 it's something along the lines of permission roles being corrupted or something with various phrases that people have used for it.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 The best way to avoid that happening, I found, is to make sure that you are saving a headless world as the headless user.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So log in as the headless user into your regular Neos, then you can use save as or save copy to save a copy of that world.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Alternatively, and I understand that this requires a Patreon subscription, but it's probably the best way to do it,

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 set up a group for you and your headless, save the world into the headless's inventory, sorry, the group's inventory,

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 and then the group will own it and then any members of the group can update it,

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 which leads to much less issues when it comes to management of that.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I've recently moved a bunch of worlds into a group inventory and I haven't had to rebuild the permissions on a particular world that it kept doing that for.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 That also allows you to do sort of paralysed running of a world, for example, let's say that your headless was running a super cool hangout map,

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 and then in another session you open from the group inventory, you open that same world,

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 and you change the colour of the seats because you wanted the seats to be different, and then you save that world.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 All you'd then have to do is restart the headless and those updates would happen,

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 and many people have their headless's restart sort of every six hours anyway,

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 so it means that then then becomes sort of like a six hour cycle of updates to a headless's world where it restarts and it gets the latest changes.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 So that's what I recommend. If someone's available they can find the GitHub issue for that, I'll get it when we run out of questions.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Moving down the list, we've got various comments about hold music being scary,

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Windows search being the worst, yep, Rain asks a question,

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 "Create some figurines of my avatar, but when I try to download them it always resulted in error."

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Depends what you're doing there, if you're using the figurine maker from a few MMCS ago,

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 that will convert your avatar and figurine mode into a static mesh which should be exportable.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Just as a general statement for everyone, I don't want to pick on you Rain too much,

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 one of my pet peeves when it comes to helping people with Neos is when people say it resulted in an error or something happened,

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I'm like, "What happened?" So if you can elaborate what you saw, then I can absolutely help you out more.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Like what error did you see? What happened when you tried?

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 There's a meme from... I accidentally, here we go.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 It's like missing information that enables me to help.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 The version of that one which I remember seeing is "I accidentally a flashlight"

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 and everyone's like "Oh, what what?" and then they just went with the whole thing!

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 It's like, did you eat it? Did you put it somewhere you shouldn't have?

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 What did you do with the flashlight? It's like "I accidentally a flashlight!"

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 But apparently that is an offshoot from the original one which appears to be about a .rar file.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So if you have any more information about what's going on there, I'll be able to help you out.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Moving forwards, Rain asks what headless means. Headless are sort of servers, they're not really servers.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Later on we'll have a feature which is actual servers.

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It's a way to run Neos without a graphical user interface.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 You can put it onto a server or you can put it onto a spare laptop that you haven't used in five years and it's just under a desk somewhere.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And then it allows you to have a permanent 24/7 uptime world on Neos that you can join.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 There are lots of them available, frankly too many, but enough.

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 People use them to... it sort of reduces the stress and pressure of hosting a world,

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 because when you host a world currently, if you need to go to bed or you've got to go,

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 that world will close and everyone will have to leave.

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But if you have that laptop I mentioned that's under your desk, then people can continue.

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 They can continue operating on that world. You go to bed, you wake up, the world's still running.

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Headless clients, as they're called, are locked behind a Patreon tier.

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So you have to go to patreon.com/neosvr or there's a link somewhere to get there.

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And subscribe to the appropriate tier to get headless access and then you gain access to it.

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 That's also what I meant by subscription.

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Going on to Rain's next question, which is what is a subscription? I really want to fund Neosys development.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 So there is a Neos Patreon, which is how you can get various perks in Neos.

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Right now, due to various reasons, that Patreon doesn't actually really fund development.

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 So please only use it for stuff that you need, such as storage space, groups and access to the headless client.

84
00:07:40,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Thanks, Rabber. So Rabber, yesterday, last, last yesterday, last week, Rabber was asking about locale files being updated, the Neos locale repository.

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And I mentioned that you could download the locale files manually and put them into a folder and Neos would then pick them up and use them.

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And since then, Rabber has created a mod which does just that.

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 That has put a reminder, it is on my to-do list, but my to-do list is like insane.

88
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Next to process locale PRs is do the dishes. So I've done the dishes because my to-do list also had several other copies of do the dishes because my life is a chaotic mess.

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But I will ensure, let me just move that down to there.

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 I scrolled through it and it had like vacuum on it four times and I'd actually already vacuumed.

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 But I do need to vacuum again, so it needs to go back on the to-do list.

92
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It's just like a big notepad document I keep. I've tried all sorts of systems for making to-do lists better, but this is the one that works for me.

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So Rain elaborates on their figuring downloading issues and they said it was taking forever and then it gave up trying to download issues because it was not compressed into a single mesh.

94
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Are you using the export dialogue? Like it should be fine. Depends how you're doing it though.

95
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Again, need slightly more information I guess. Maybe I could do like a tutorial on exporting. I might have some of it somewhere.

96
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 It should be fine unless your avatar is like a mess. Like if it's got like thousands of materials, like humongous amounts of meshes, half of IKEA stuck to your face, then it might take a long time.

97
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But otherwise it should be fine. Most avatars are simple enough once they're in figuring mode.

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 As for your next question, which is "Is there a newest development channel or a feature request section?"

99
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 So development, you can take a look at devlog or announcements. I'll just drop those in the chat so you can see those.

100
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 There isn't much there right now due to various things that are on announcements I don't want to get into.

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 For feature requests, you can go ahead and drop them into GitHub. Please do search before you make an issue as there are like 1,700 issues open.

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 1,783, we're almost at 1,800. And lots of stuff there.

103
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 A good example being we get a lot of users asking about dark mode for things like our inventory and contact screen.

104
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 That is a feature which is on that list. It's understandable why people would be asking for it, but it is on that list.

105
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Now I've got that open, I'll go ahead and find the rolls being corrupted thing that Tiki was asking about.

106
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 "Rolls corrupted. Cohesion rolls are being destroyed." Yeah, actually made by Wraith, a member of the Neos team here. Here it is.

107
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 As you can see by the commentary on it, people really, really dislike the fact that this is happening.

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Even by shadowpamper, there's even a testing on what's going on.

109
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I do have a tutorial for exporting something? Okay. Oh, I don't remember making that one.

110
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I do have over 300 now, so it's getting a bit difficult to remember all the ones that I've done.

111
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 It's been like three years, so...

112
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 "What did you eat for dinner last week Tuesday?" No idea. No idea.

113
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 With that, we are out of questions. So if you do have any additional questions, please do drop them down into the office hours text chat.

114
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 That's a couple of channels above the one you're currently in, looking at the office hours.

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Lost. That is not occurring. Hope you're all having a good day, I guess.

116
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 I've got a giant box by my front door. It's just a giant box.

117
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And the way what giant boxes work in my huge apartment building is, I have to take them via the elevator down to the parking floor,

118
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 get lost like seven times to find the actual room, which is where the trash chutes terminate.

119
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So there's a trash chute on my floor and it terminates in that floor I'm talking about, and then I have to put it into a bin there, because it can't fit down the trash chute.

120
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 For those wondering, "Oh, you could cut up the box." Yeah, I could cut up the box, but that would take so long, and it also still might clog the trash chute.

121
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And if I clog the trash chute, and they can prove that I've clogged the trash chute, they charge me $100 fine, so I will venture down to the parking area.

122
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And you'll be like, "Well, how do they know you did it?" And I'm like, "Well, it's almost like the box has my name and address on it."

123
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 It's actually really problematic. You see some residents who do clog the trash chute with big boxes, who have pulled off the mailing labels

124
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 so that people can't identify it's them that have clogged the trash chute.

125
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 That's like when you know as a child you've done something wrong, but you're trying to not get in trouble anyway. That's exactly that.

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It's like, guys, come on.

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 RTX says, "Does Nenus have a mascot?"

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Nenus has many mascots.

129
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 So some of our mascots are just common memes that we have.

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 You can see from, if you watch our streams on Fridays, etc., you'll see various things continually come up.

131
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 In some aspects, Yellow Dog Man is one of our mascots. It's just sort of a colloquial name for Frixius.

132
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Frixius is also kind of a mascot, as are the rest of the team members, including me.

133
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 If you're talking like an official mascot, no.

134
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Like for example, Discord's official mascot is kind of its logo, because its logo is a character with eyes, etc.

135
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 PHP has an elephant or something. You know, all sorts of stuff like that.

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Chuck E. Cheese has Chuck E. Cheese. I don't know why Chuck E. Cheese came up, I apologize for that.

137
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Someone in here has Chuck E. Cheese's theme tune playing in their head now, I apologize.

138
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Tiki says, "Seems I'm hitting all those nice bugs that are already documented on GitHub every week."

139
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Feel free to ask anyway. I am happy to be your search engine.

140
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I'm more familiar with some of the common problems that users come across, so if I need to find it for you, that's absolutely fine.

141
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 So we have another question here from Rain. Rain says, "Can you procedurally generate a world using logics?

142
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 You'd be able to generate worlds based on scenes and explore and build on them?"

143
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 If you want to, yeah. It'll be a lot of work, but you absolutely can.

144
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 There's been various types of that that are similar to that, but nothing explicitly like that.

145
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I believe that you're talking about something similar to probably Minecraft.

146
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So just to let you know, there's various caveats to it, because it has been updated in a while,

147
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 but you can actually import your Minecraft world into Nius, if you'd like.

148
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 As for non-Minecraft generation, let's take a simple example.

149
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Let's say you had five random shapes. You know, you've got a sphere, a torus, a cube, a cone.

150
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Name a few other random shapes. I've ran out of random shapes in my brain.

151
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 You could write logics which randomly picks between those five shapes every meter for the world,

152
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 and places one of them at a random size, rotation, and color. You could absolutely do that.

153
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And while that doesn't look that good, it's still random and procedurally generated.

154
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 If you do that with trees, you could actually get a visual thing.

155
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 But when you're learning, try doing those shapes.

156
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Foxbox says, "Gemini has an issue with Nius. Will it not play videos using the native Unity player?

157
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 The video will be a missing image. There are no jobs for it, no errors in the Nius log.

158
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 We've tried clearing the cache, fixing the DirectX libraries. We're at a loss."

159
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Sorry to hear that. Have you tried the VLC player?

160
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I actually don't know which player my computer prefers, because I never go into the settings and edit it.

161
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 We would need a bug report for that one, though, with more information including those log files.

162
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So please open one over on the GitHub.

163
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Something which I've been playing with in my head about trying to do inside Nius using logics as well

164
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 is an algorithm called...

165
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Gee, what's it called?

166
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Wavefunction Collapse. There we go.

167
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Wavefunction Collapse.

168
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Wavefunction Collapse is... it sounds really complicated.

169
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Trust me, you're not going to tear open the world with a black hole or something.

170
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 It's just an algorithm for building worlds.

171
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And I think it's probably possible in logics to do Wavefunction Collapse.

172
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 With Wavefunction Collapse, you can have an entirely procedural world with all sorts of stuff going on.

173
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 It would be a lot of work, though.

174
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 For those of you who are VRChat people, or play VRChat, there is a world on VRChat called Stairs or something.

175
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 It's elaborate gold staircases with a red carpet, you know, sort of fancy palace-style stairs.

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And the stairs go on for infinity. I think that is Wavefunction Collapse.

177
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 You can just fall for five minutes and you're still on stairs.

178
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 What I want to do is a map similar to that where there's a goal.

179
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 The wavefunction does occur, but there is a goal, so there's a path to go through it.

180
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Moving forwards, because we have another question.

181
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Mingyu says "I use a Pimax 8K X with 200 degree FOV. Mirrors will display a double image for me."

182
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 This is a known issue with mirrors. I will get you the GitHub link.

183
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 I think it's this one. There's lots of issues with Pimax and stuff.

184
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 There's lots of issues with mirrors, generally, it seems.

185
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Yeah, I see "First Shader renders oddly a mirror's quest mirror doubling."

186
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 "Mirrors not reflecting each other when one is used in blah blah blah blah."

187
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 That's by design. Why was it not closed? Oh, they've opened.

188
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Seems like Fruch is saying we could maybe do it later.

189
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So yeah, there's the issue that you're dealing with.

190
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Follow that issue for more information about it.

191
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Rain has a question who says "Is there a way to open any link in NES like it's its own Chromium-based window and use that window similar to any other?"

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 No, there's not currently.

193
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 The closest thing that we'd have to that on our roadmap right now would be screen sharing.

194
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 So we hope to have that implemented when we can get to it.

195
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And that would allow you to share a screen from outside of NES on your computer into the NES world.

196
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 That's more complicated than people realize because it's basically video streaming.

197
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 What we have to do is capture your stream, turn that into a video stream, and then stream that to everyone else in the session.

198
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Rain, welcome to NES. You must be a new player with these questions, which is absolutely fine, by the way.

199
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 I don't mind answering them at all.

200
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 It's just when I see this many questions, I'm like, it means someone is excited to play NES, and that makes me excited.

201
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So thank you so much for all the questions.

202
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 So Rain, again, with a question, says "I'd like to hide my head bone locally instead of just adjusting NCCLIP. Is there a way to do that?"

203
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Currently there is not. We don't support that natively.

204
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 There are a few mods that allow you to do it, and someone's going to talk to you about mods eventually.

205
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Neos allows modding, whereas VRChat does not, and there is a Neos mod for that.

206
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 If you'd like to have more information about that, you need to go ahead and take a look at the modding discord, where we keep modding content, basically.

207
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Shadow proposes an interesting solution, but that will not work in Mirrors. Like, in Mirrors, you'll have a very small head.

208
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 It is a little bit similar to other mods that have existed, but I understand how it might be difficult.

209
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I was playing Stranded Deep the other day. Stranded Deep is... I don't want to say Raft Clone, but Raft Clone?

210
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Raft's like a clearly superior game to Stranded Deep, but Stranded Deep does cool stuff as well.

211
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And Stranded Deep has mods, and installing Stranded Deep mods was almost equivalent to the Neos mod, except there was of course a GUI visual thing for it.

212
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 It was basically like, download the mod manager, drag in some zips, hit go. The only mod I needed was... I only needed three mods.

213
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 One added a map, because navigating Stranded Deep is terrible. Another one added the ability to use the label maker in multiplayer, which for some reason doesn't work in multiplayer.

214
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And then the third mod was right at the end of the game, to allow me to spawn items, because at the end of the game you need fuel, and to make fuel you need to boil potatoes.

215
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And I was not going to sit there and wait for, I don't know, like 40 potatoes to grow just for the end of the game.

216
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 I'd done everything in the game, except the end game, which requires about 40 potatoes to be boiled.

217
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I'm like, I'm spawning 40 potatoes. I'm not waiting for these 40 potatoes to grow. No way.

218
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 It's weird because when I was young I saw cheating in video games as something fun, and something that could be done if you wanted to.

219
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 But it felt cheating. It felt cheating. But as I've got older, I'm like, cheating is purely because I need to go to bed. I'm tired. I don't want to play this game anymore.

220
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Give me my 40 potatoes and go away.

221
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Rain says they like Neos because you can basically recreate any game if you tried hard enough, or I'd assume that's the goal if not true.

222
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 That is kind of the goal. Lots of people call Neos a game, but that's sort of like, not correct, but no one's going to tell you off at doing it.

223
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It's just whatever you refer it to is fine. But you can do whatever you want in there.

224
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 We do have first person shooters, we do have card games, we do have parkour, all sorts of things.

225
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I haven't seen an RTS yet. I've seen stuff similar to an RTS. That's things like Command and Conquer, etc.

226
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Someone should build an RTS, that'd be cool. Those are the games where you create units and then order them around a battlefield. That'd be cool.

227
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Racing happens a lot, RPGs happen a lot, there's quite a few systems there. There's even a world where you can blacksmith various types of weapons. They're really cool.

228
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 In about a month's time, you'll be able to see additional more games, because there will be some games created for the MMC competition which starts tomorrow.

229
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 We have four minutes left, so if anyone has any additional questions please get them typed into the thread, otherwise I'm going to sit here and maybe rant about video games that I've used cheats on.

230
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Someone play Grounded. Grounded is like, really cool, but towards the end it just got really grindy, so again, I cheated on that one.

231
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I wanna go to bed. Let me cheat.

232
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Oh, your questions, so I'll swap to that rather than ranting about Grounded.

233
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So Lex asks "Is it intended for people to be able to view session details of contacts and contacts plus sessions even though they're not a contact of anyone in the world?"

234
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Note this is only possible through the API and not the world browser. "What details can you view?"

235
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Ooh. I could understand the... you're not able to join, right Lex? Cool.

236
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I know that we do consider contacts and contacts plus air quotes "public" for the purposes of guidelines, particularly the adult content guideline.

237
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 But, I will have to bring that one up with the team. I will make a note of that right now. Excuse any incredibly loud typing noises that occur.

238
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Okay, good, you can't do it. At least you can't join, that's good.

239
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 So for a private session that is a session set to private, not a session that's set to hidden, but that will also work, and it's complicated.

240
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 For a session set to private, and you can prove this with the lovely application called Wireshark, private sessions don't even tell the Neos cloud that they exist.

241
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 So we get a lot of comments sometimes, and rumors, because I don't know in terms of VRChat if it's possible, but over in VRChat people are like "Yeah, VRChat staff can join your private sessions and be a peer invisible."

242
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And I always say "In Neos that's not possible and you can literally prove it. If you set it to private, the API does not know that you exist."

243
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 So we would be able to find it even if we needed to. It will show up in your contacts list that that user is in a private world, but the status of what a contact is doing is separate from the actual instance, so we don't get any instance details.

244
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 But it sounds like it might be like a bypass or like a thing, because contacts in contacts plus is something that might change, particularly contacts plus, right?

245
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It might be suddenly you are able to join because someone that is on your contacts list joins, but I will double check with the rest of the team when I get the chance.

246
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I see lots of people typing, but it is half past, so those people who are typing, please continue typing.

247
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 But no more questions after those people that are typing have finished typing.

248
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 It's probably the most complicated way to say what I just said, but whatever.

249
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 I have coffee. Do you like coffee? Coffee's great.

250
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Slinker says "Discord only just gave me a notification about this, Ted." Well Slinker, it has been the same time each week for I think almost a year now.

251
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I'll double check. It's probably over a year. I missed the year anniversary of this event.

252
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 So you can just go ahead and put it in your calendar and it will always be this time.

253
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Very, very rarely I do cancel it. Usually when I fly to Spain. If I'm flying to Spain, I cancel it, but otherwise it's still there.

254
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 I will move things around, cancel things, and make sure I make it purely so that you have a defined weekly occurrence of me talking about coffee and weird video games to you.

255
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Yeah, I actually have on my to-do list, it's actually an issue assigned to me, is we're gonna re-look at the Discord integration a little bit.

256
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Currently the Discord integration exists in the Unity portion of Nios, and I've already moved it to the Fruits Engine portion of it, which gives us a little bit more control.

257
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Because the Unity project's a bit of a mess. I'll look at that one as well.

258
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Dante says "Hidden is not private. Anyone who finds out the session ID could still join a hidden session."

259
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 You have to set it to private if you actually want it private, I see people confused and think misunderstanding has caused a lot of the rumors.

260
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I think, Dante, we as the Nios team, in moderation, we just need to... there's that table that goes around where people are like "yeah, you can do adult content in this table"

261
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 I think we just need to make an official one. Yeah, it's like a table of green and red squares about when the adult content policy applies and stuff like that.

262
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I think we just need to make it official at this point. Then we can sort of plaster it all over the walls.

263
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 For reference, for everyone that is here, if you go to the guidelines wiki page, and I'm going to read it from the guidelines because I want to misspeak,

264
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 I'm literally going to go to the guidelines page and read it straight off there.

265
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I tapped in "Guidelines Nios Wiki" into Google and it sent me to "Optimization Guidelines" which is close but not quite.

266
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Alright, here we are.

267
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 "To make use of adult content without violating the Nios usage guidelines, we recommend hosting adult content in a private private world. Private sessions are sessions that require an invitation to join.

268
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Hosting adult content in a world where all users who access it and can view it have consented to view the content and are of appropriate age."

269
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 That is adult content 3, 1 and 2. We actually don't mention hidden at all I think in that.

270
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Yeah, we don't mention hidden at all. Yeah, we should make that matrix and make it done and official.

271
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 With that though, I think we are done with our questions.

272
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 So I'm going to go ahead and leave off here and we will start back up again next week at exactly the same time, at which point MMC will be fully underway.

273
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Please do consider entering the MMC, it is not too late to make an entry.

274
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 You have until February 1st to enter your entry and I hope to see exciting things that you've made.

275
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 In the meantime, if you have any additional questions, please feel free to drop them in the questions and help channel, direct message me directly, or make up issues, make moderation tickets, whatever type of question it is, there is a way for it to be answered.

276
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Please ask questions wherever you can.

277
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I will speak to you all again next week.

278
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Shadow, yeah, you can enter, I'm sorry, I say goodbye and then someone asks a question, I'm like, sure, go for it.

279
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 You could make an entry until February 1st, like there is no entry deadline.

280
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Like people, because there's a form you have to fill in to like enter and it is not required to fill in that form before the first.

281
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 You can fill in that form at any point during February, during, wait a minute, I've got my months confused.

282
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Let me restate this, I mean March, I mean March, I'm sorry, it's like the boundary between January and the rest of the year just makes everyone confused about calendars.

283
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 You know, like the first couple of days of January where you write 2022 and you're just like, ugh, happens for the entirety of January.

284
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Yeah, don't worry about it.

285
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Okay, I got to restate, you have until March 1st to make, fill in the entry form and submit your world.

286
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Apologies for that one, months, time zones and dates are fun.

287
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Okay, for real now, this time, for real.

288
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 If you have any other questions about MMC, just DM me or post to the MMC channel.

289
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I'll see you again next week.
