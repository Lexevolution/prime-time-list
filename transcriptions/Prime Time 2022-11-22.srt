00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello everyone, welcome to prime time. We're going to be answering questions in the order that they arrive in the questions for prime time threads.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,140
So grab the questions, drop them in and I'll get to them as soon as I can.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,720
If you don't know what's going on, I'm going to answer questions about Neos. If you have them, drop them in the thread. We'll go through them in turn.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:28,660
So starting off today, we have a question from Specs who says I'm not sure where the Unity SDK fits into the future if at all, but I have talked to users that greatly desire desktop editing building experience closer to a more typical game engine.

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:38,660
They find it clunky to juggle camera control for viewing inspectors and logics while building. Are there any future plans to add such an interface or make UI except easier to build for creating our own?

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:46,660
Unity SDK is quite low on our priorities right now, particularly seeing as we're moving away from Unity, it makes things like that a little bit more difficult.

7
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:55,660
So that's kind of low on the priority. You can also take a look at the project board, which I think it has listed.

8
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,660
By the way, low doesn't mean never, it just means low, so keep that in mind.

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:13,660
As for additional UI and interfaces, I don't think so right now. Our biggest push there was on the small standardized newer desktop mode.

10
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:23,660
That does have a lot better features for desktop users, some which I don't see many users use, such as the control click to focus, which lets you program logics on a 2D plane.

11
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:32,660
No need for a blueprint there, just go ahead and program it on a 2D plane, just spawn a node, control click it with your camera if you're on a desktop and you'll focus to that one.

12
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,660
And then you can kind of just like scrub around, it makes things tidier in desktop.

13
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:42,660
Other than that, it sort of falls into the same category as like, hey, people wanting text based because they don't like building in VR.

14
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:54,660
There will be enhancements to everything you do building in VR, but nothing I'm aware of on the planets that sort of matches Unity style workplace where you are not in the game while you're editing.

15
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,660
It's kind of the whole point of Neos currently, at least.

16
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:13,660
Scary guy says why do I use Q icon instead of question icon and tick instead of some other Neos related. The icons we use don't matter, they're just so that I don't miss questions. Whoever is adding them, thank you very much. Someone does it every week, thank you so much.

17
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:22,660
We could use potatoes and oranges, I really don't care. Moving on. Icons not important.

18
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:33,660
When teaching a user how to build, use the dev tools, what are the most important areas to start with? Please make sure that you're starting with basic tools, not multi tools.

19
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,660
They should understand the functions and the processes for each individual tool before you get the multi tool.

20
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,660
I've seen some users who are unaware of the difference between a dev tool and a logic tool. They just know that they need the tool, the multi tool to do everything.

21
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:54,660
Therefore, they continue to get confused, particularly when they go into logics and they don't know that they need another tool. Sometimes it gets confusing.

22
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:03,660
As for the dev tools, teach them all the usual standard processes with the dev tip. Don't forget gizmos.

23
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,660
Also, strangely, and I'll be doing a tutorial on this soon, don't forget telling people how the tool shelves work. I've seen some people just assume they do nothing.

24
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:18,660
The tool shelves are so cool and so fast for any tool-based development, and I don't see anyone using them, so make sure you use them. They're cool.

25
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Scary guy says, actual question, not a suggestion. Disguised as a question.

26
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:31,660
If you move away from Unity, where are you moving to? See the previous answers to that in the office hour notes and various other conversations.

27
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,660
I don't really want to rehash them here, but we're looking into various engine types to move away from.

28
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:44,660
I don't really remember what the current plan is. That will be source currently, which I believe uses, like, forges. I don't remember.

29
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:54,660
It's not Unity, though. Yeah, forge branch known as source. It's like a branch that has a name and it kind of jumps around a little bit.

30
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,660
Yeah, forge is an engine and then branching it with source and adding stuff to it.

31
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,660
The goal being Unity is holding us back in more ways than I can count, so we need something better.

32
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:19,660
Yeah, be very careful about customized tools. Like I said, I don't want to keep hampering on multi-tools and custom inspectors, but you should know how to use the basic tools because they will teach you how to do stuff.

33
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:28,660
Whereas if you start throwing customized tooling and very complicated tools at them, sometimes it's more difficult to learn the right way.

34
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:35,660
For example, when people learn logics, they often start with, I want to make a gun. That's a common one. I want to make a gun in logics.

35
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,660
I would like you to start with, I want to add two numbers together in logics. That's how you learn logics, right? I want to add two numbers together. Let's start with that.

36
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,660
Make sure they can spawn the nodes. It shouldn't be at the point where if I'm helping a user and I'm like, oh, yeah, we'll need that node for it.

37
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,660
And they find the node, but they don't know how to spawn the node. Like, there isn't a point where we should get to.

38
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Okay. We'll wait for additional questions. Specs as if you want to use a multi-tool, make sure you're using a minimal one. I do agree as well.

39
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:08,660
There are some multi-tools which add every single goddamn tool to them, and I literally only use two these days.

40
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:16,660
I use the dev tip and the logics tip. Even for materials, I hardly ever use the material tool tip these days because I want more control over it.

41
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:26,660
It's, again, the similar problem to the, like, showing new users too many things. You know, you're just like, hey, look, new user, there's, like, stuff everywhere.

42
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:35,660
There's the TikTok made by Kenatron, which is just, like, chill out. Let new users chill a little bit.

43
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Always remember that new users, particularly those new users who are coming from VRChat, are used to sitting in front of a mirror all night.

44
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:50,660
And if you're suddenly throwing the entire world at them, it's going to be overwhelming. Yeah, that TikTok. That TikTok's amazing.

45
00:05:50,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Also, double check that they know the various control names. We can't get to the point of teaching someone logics or development if they don't know the words primary, secondary, context, menu, and grab.

46
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:11,660
I've seen this, right? You know, I'm like, oh, yeah, to spawn the logics interface for that, you need to push secondary and they don't know what secondary is.

47
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,660
By default, it's on the home page of your dash and it's talked about in the tutorials.

48
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,660
Like, if they don't know those controls, they shouldn't be learning logics, sit with them and teach them the controls.

49
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:31,660
I will await additional questions. Scary guy asks, where have I been lately? Haven't seen you in any public worlds. Elsewhere. Full stop.

50
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:41,660
Question from Tiki who says, I've been playing with moving my gravity yesterday. When it's parented to my foot, it makes me respond to load an avatar. Would that be expected?

51
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Not sure. It's not skipped. It's just if you post a giant image, it makes it difficult for me to immediately see a question.

52
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,660
I scroll up and down when I don't see any questions at the bottom and I get to them. All people remind me.

53
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:03,660
I have a giant monitor, yeah, but I don't have Discord maximized because Discord maximized is a great way to not do any work.

54
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,660
I don't know what that would be. Make sure you're parenting the entire grabber hierarchy.

55
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:18,660
Ideally, I would parent everything up to the actual anchor to your foot and then you make sure you get the whole object.

56
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Also make sure that when you're parenting it, at no point does the grabber component leave your user root.

57
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:36,660
I've seen a few people that will parent it to other places via the root slot or something and that's just not necessary.

58
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:46,660
Parent it from one place directly to the other and you'll have less issues. If a grabber leaves your user root, it will disable itself.

59
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,660
And now we'll go to Russia's question, which I did miss.

60
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:06,660
Has there been any other projects similar to the Sydney...

61
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Sorry, I reminded you of something. I'll post it in a second.

62
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Has there been any other projects similar to the Sydney presentation you've been working on and talk about?

63
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Constantly. There's about 400 of them. Which ones would you like to hear about?

64
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
Just constantly.

65
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,660
For those unaware, they're talking about the Sydney project, which I posted on my YouTube. I'll get you that link.

66
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:40,660
As well as the video I had immediately popped into my brain when I was thinking about my inability to speak.

67
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,660
Which made me giggle too much. Let's see.

68
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,660
So I should leave this link.

69
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,660
So here's the presentation.

70
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,660
And then this one. Yes, it's this one.

71
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,660
This one here is what I was thinking of when I couldn't speak English.

72
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,660
The various misspellings of pregnant.

73
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Have I encountered the Dutch university people? No.

74
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,660
Occasionally I do. We used to have education and science meetings.

75
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,660
But we kind of ran out of stuff to talk about, basically.

76
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,660
And there was a lot of times where we would just talk about doing stuff, but not actually do stuff.

77
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:26,660
I kind of wanted to reintroduce those, but kind of make them a more show and tell style meeting.

78
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,660
Where it would be like, if you've got something to show, you can show it.

79
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,660
Otherwise, let's not have a meeting, because otherwise it's just talking.

80
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,660
I think there was one of them where it was an hour long.

81
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,660
And it was basically the equivalent of science is cool, yo.

82
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,660
For an hour. Moving on to Specs's question.

83
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,660
I was making a raw data tool tip object the other day and noticed the primary ball doesn't seem to toggle

84
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,660
if I press my trigger while holding the object with a laser.

85
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,660
Other values such as primary strength seem to update fine. Is this intended behavior?

86
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Primary doesn't update if you hold your trigger while holding an object with the laser.

87
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:12,660
Well, I have the code base open, so let me just jump over to raw data tool tip and see what the hell drives primary.

88
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,660
All right. I'd have to look at the logic there. There's what's called a blocking mechanism,

89
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:26,660
which is where you can block if a primary goes through.

90
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,660
That's usually if you're holding something or things like that.

91
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,660
So primary's value is not primary blocked.

92
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:44,660
So primary is not blocked. Anded with the primary trigger value.

93
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,660
Doesn't make sense to me. I'd have to take a look at it.

94
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Just reading this, it doesn't make sense.

95
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,660
If primary isn't reporting, then primary strength shouldn't be reporting.

96
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,660
Any future plans or ways someone might push the token gate component?

97
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,660
I think it only works on two tokens currently.

98
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,660
I don't know what you're referring to, the token gate component.

99
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,660
If you have the exact component name, that would help.

100
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,660
Because I don't know what that component is. We don't have a component by that name.

101
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,660
Moving forwards to fox box question. Hi there.

102
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,660
Last week my ESDB corrupted. I didn't recover it.

103
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,660
A few things was missing from my inventory.

104
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,660
I could not locate it. Also changed my favorite data.

105
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Similar thing happened to my who lost a few avatar updates.

106
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,660
My question is if we are fully synced to the cloud, why were these assets lost?

107
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,660
I don't know without logs and individual circumstances there.

108
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Unfortunately, wish I could answer better there.

109
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,660
But when it comes to database corruption and stuff like that, I need to look at logs and stuff.

110
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,660
That wasn't tagged to a question, scary, eh?

111
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,660
So I didn't look at it. Yes, it is a question.

112
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,660
Moving up.

113
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,660
Zari asks for any funny moments in code recently.

114
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,660
There was something. I'm just trying to remember what it was.

115
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Not that I can remember funny enough to remember promptly.

116
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,660
Appearances. Oh, the token enabled component.

117
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,660
The token enabled component just sees if it's a token enabled build.

118
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,660
It cannot enable token related functionality on the steam build.

119
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,660
So the token enabled facet lets you know if tokens are enabled or not.

120
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,660
It wouldn't suit integration with other tokens because it is a yes or no.

121
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,660
It is are we allowed to use tokens on the steam build? Nope.

122
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,660
So I don't think adding additional tokens to that makes sense.

123
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,660
I think adding that component, are we on steam?

124
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,660
And it would be true, like, most of the time?

125
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,660
Like, are we on steam component?

126
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,660
Actually, because it's token enabled, it would be are we not on steam?

127
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,660
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,660
Ramp says do you have any favorite custom inspectors?

129
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Oh, I do. I have my favorite.

130
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,660
My favorite custom inspector is the default inspector.

131
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
My favorite inspector.

132
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,660
I'll just scroll around, make sure I'm not forgetting anything.

133
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Yeah, I've already changed one thing on the inspector so far, which is I lined up the fields.

134
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,660
That was a mod by RT, I believe, and I just implemented the mod directly into the game.

135
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,660
Which I plan to do with a lot of mods.

136
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
So that's cool.

137
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,660
I think it references the currency conversion node, which can only do NCR and USD currently.

138
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Yeah, that one is probably never going to get more currency conversions.

139
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:16,660
Because strangely enough, the currency conversion rates of many things are tied behind really complicated APIs.

140
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,660
And a lot of those are like, hey, pay us money.

141
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,660
And I think it's a silly thing to pay money for, so no.

142
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:30,660
I know a couple of people have introduced UI that they've made themselves that does requests to external APIs to do that.

143
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,660
I think that's a much better use of that node than the currency conversion one.

144
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
It's just a bit problematic.

145
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,660
Lex asks for pet peeves ofNeos functionality.

146
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Let's see, do you want to list? I'm going to list.

147
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
It will be a funny conversation.

148
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,660
I don't like how the input system isn't defined by standard key codes.

149
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,660
It's something weird in the middle of that, which means that my remap keyboard has a lot of issues.

150
00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:00,660
So if you ever notice me on desktop deleting Bodgix nodes slowly, it's because my delete key literally will not be recognized by Neos,

151
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,660
but will be by 99% of the other applications that exist on my computer.

152
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,660
My delete key is actually pagedown.

153
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,660
That's what it's labeled on the keyboard.

154
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,660
But I have remapped it using the official Windows remapping functionality to delete Neosignals.

155
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660
So that really annoys me.

156
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:27,660
The fact that for some reasons, something along the lines of, it's either Neos, asset imp, which is our asset importer,

157
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:35,660
or something in the middle there will turn my models inside out and flip them by 180 degrees when I import them for no reason.

158
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,660
I don't understand. That annoys me.

159
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,660
MRI and medical scan data has to be a unit cube.

160
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,660
It cannot be, you can of course make the unit cube bigger by scaling it, right?

161
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,660
What I mean is you cannot make a rectangular image, an MRI scan, which is problematic for anything other than head,

162
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:01,660
because every other body part pretty much is a rectangle, not a square.

163
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
That needs to be fixed for many reasons.

164
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,660
We got around with maths previously, but it was not pretty.

165
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Let's see, what else have we got?

166
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,660
The value graph recorder will disable itself if you accidentally enter zero in some fields, which is really annoying.

167
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,660
It should just filter invalid values and default to like one instead of zero and breaking.

168
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,660
That's that.

169
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,660
Logics interface bug, but that annoys everyone.

170
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,660
Yeah, basically lots of that stuff.

171
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,660
Let's take a look.

172
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,660
You're more than welcome to do that.

173
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,660
I just don't think it's that useful.

174
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,660
Also ain't any first party support for crypto pending to be mute.

175
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:00,660
That depends on the ongoing issues, which I'm not going to discuss, because it brings down the whole mood of the place.

176
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:07,660
Speaking of API, there's only a future where Neos might be able to interact with Discord's API.

177
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Beautiful question. I love this one, because it's often misunderstood.

178
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,660
Discord's API is only for bots.

179
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,660
They're restricting it further and further to bots.

180
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Custom clients, as in clients which change how you receive Discord messages are not allowed by Discord's terms of service.

181
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,660
So at no point will Neos be making a Discord client inside of Neos.

182
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
That is not allowed.

183
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,660
We can make bots inside Neos, or we can make Logics nodes to allow you to make Discord bots.

184
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,660
But we can't display your messages inside Neos without breaking the terms of service of Discord.

185
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
So no, that's not going to happen.

186
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,660
I full on support Discord's terms of service in that regard.

187
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,660
I love it. I think it's great.

188
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Custom clients are cool in some places, but if they make that, fantastic.

189
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Sorry, but what if a bot reads the message and then duplicates itself into Neos?

190
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:15,660
That's possible, except reading the contents of a Discord message requires a specific permission,

191
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,660
which is being revoked from bots once they reach a certain level of service that they're in.

192
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
I believe it's 100 or 1000.

193
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:28,660
If you wish to read the message contents of any message on Discord, you need to apply for additional validation,

194
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,660
and that sometimes comes with a monetary cost.

195
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,660
This is because wherever possible, they're trying to move Discord over bots, at least,

196
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,660
to using the slash command rather than exclamation marks.

197
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,660
If your bot on your Discord server right now uses exclamation mark potato or whatever for your commands,

198
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,660
they want you to move over to slash-based commands, because on slash-based commands,

199
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:55,660
they are officially registered with Discord, and they don't require the bot to receive all of the text message that appears.

200
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,660
They only require the bot to receive the message when a slash command is used,

201
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
and I agree again with their policy there.

202
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,660
You could argue either way, but I agree with their way of doing it.

203
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:13,660
In fact, I once interviewed for the role at Discord that would be handling how those slash commands work for clients.

204
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,660
So, yeah. They also have auto-complete. They're also secure. They can also launch custom UI, all sorts of cool stuff.

205
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:29,660
Specs linked a bad Halo Ninja modification to headless, which has a Discord bot in it, which is cool.

206
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,660
Shadow says, with Discord now natively being integrated into Xbox, is there a chance that Discord will be integrated intoNeos?

207
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:46,660
No. No. So Xbox is humongous, and they've been working on the integration with Discord for months,

208
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,660
and they have special partnerships with them. There's probably paperwork set up. There might be money set up.

209
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Some of the engineers working on the integration are friends of mine.

210
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,660
They obviously can't tell me all the details, because they're not allowed to,

211
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,660
but I do know that they've been working on it for quite a long time, and I know that they're proud of it.

212
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,660
I have friends that are on both sides of that as well. But essentially, no.

213
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,660
Mr. asks, is there going to be first party support for screen share? Yes, there is a GitHub issue open for that.

214
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:22,660
For those who are wondering why that's complicated, you need to remember that screen sharing is basically video,

215
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,660
and so sharing video is effectively streaming video, which I happen to be an expert on, and that is tricky.

216
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,660
You'll even see that Zari says, doesn't the desktop menu technically record that? No, it's not video.

217
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:44,660
It uses a desktop duplication API thingy, which is part of the Windows spec. It doesn't do video.

218
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:52,660
That's another common point. Even if that did do video, it's still not the big issue.

219
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:58,660
The big issue is getting that video and escorting it across the Internet.

220
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:05,660
When I said the word big issue, anyone who lives in the UK might have also giggled, but that's okay.

221
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,660
That's a bit of a UK meme for you.

222
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Slinker, I worked for Beam, so I'm going to tell you a really big secret here.

223
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:22,660
FTL wasn't actually cool at all. FTL was just WebRTC over Nginx.

224
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:30,660
We had to brand it, of course, but it's basic technology now.

225
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:37,660
Loads of people do FTL right now.

226
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:44,660
It's good, but most of the FTL stack was just straight WebRTC code.

227
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:51,660
The entire team at Vixxer were dealing with WebRTC.

228
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,660
On a lot of streaming platforms now, you'll get speeds close or similar to FTL.

229
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,660
They're just not labeled as FTL.

230
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,660
There's no further questions. I'm going to go ahead and close it off now.

231
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Okay, you've got precisely a minute.

232
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,660
You've got one minute, Slinker. You better type faster.

233
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Prime, what is your favorite Ben & Jerry's? Don't know.

234
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Ben & Jerry's is also incredibly overpriced.

235
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:29,660
You might as well just go buy a bag of candy and buy a box of vanilla ice cream.

236
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Mix the two together and you've saved yourself a lot of money.

237
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,660
I'll go ahead and leave things off here and I will speak to you later.

238
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,660
If you have any further questions, please drop them in.

239
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,660
There is a missed question. Okay, cool, we'll get it.

240
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,660
I'm sorry, we'll get it. Sorry, it wasn't tagged.

241
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,660
Maybe it was and I missed it. I'm sorry, Lucas, I'm sorry.

242
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:01,660
Lucas, is there going to be any new features, updates on the Unity engine version of Neos?

243
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Yeah, we intend to update as many things as we can, but we are still trying to move off Unity.

244
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,660
It's not that we are waiting to move off Unity before we do updates.

245
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,660
Those things are totally separate. I went Scottish for a second.

246
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Okay, I will see you guys later. Bye bye.
