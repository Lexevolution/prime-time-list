1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 All right everyone, welcome to office hours. It is 4 p.m. So I'm gonna go ahead and get started

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,320
 So if you have questions, please drop them in the office hours text chat. There's a thread for questions

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,160
 You're not sure what this is

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,760
 This is a half hour segment where prime answers any questions that you might have about Neo

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,280
 So drop those in text format

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,580
 And I'll go ahead and answer them in the order that they appear if there are no questions

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,580
 We'll sit here in silence because that's how office hours work

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,880
 Let's go ahead and get started as we do have a question right now. So Jackal Girl says I do have a question

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,320
 Could you explain what the ballistic path procedural mesh is for? Someone stated that it had to do a teleportation

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,960
 Teleporters, but I was hoping for some more detail. Yeah, so that mesh is used for the teleport locomotion, which is in

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,980
 Default worlds by you know, when you make a new world, it's in there by default. It produces an arc which is

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,560
 Mathematically a ballistic path. I don't really know why it's called ballistic path because yes ballistic teleporting

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,360
 anyway

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,080
 That's what it's used for predominantly

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,340
 It is not that usable inside of Neos right now because you can't really affect the mathematics of that path that well

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,960
 But obviously we can from C#

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,140
 you can

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,820
 Use it if you want you do need to do mathematics though. If you look at the

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:17,840
 Trajectory node, I believe it's in physics that will give you similar inputs and outputs that will be needed for that mesh. It is a

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
 complicated mesh

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,380
 That's the only question we have so far. So I'll think about something else to say

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,660
 Revy says updates on world updates check the announcements channel. Thanks. Next question

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,760
 Okay, for those just joining us if you have any questions, please go ahead and drop them in the office hours text chat

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,680
 That's a couple of channels above this one in the thread and I'll get to them in order that they appear

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,480
 I think so for question here from cyber warlock. He says moving to a new render anytime soon

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
 I don't have any updates to share on that one

27
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:54,340
 Rendering is a topic which I am not involved in purely based on sort of I don't have the knowledge there

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:01,740
 gains our graphics program it does and they'd be able to answer more about that do check the announcement section and our roadmap on the

29
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:10,440
 On the github for any information about that one moving forwards we have Tyte who's asking a question who says I've been gone for a while

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,680
 What's the current summed up situation regarding NCR?

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,400
 You can go ahead and take a look at the announcements channel and read all the announcements in there that have the word NCR in them

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,440
 And you'll be fully up-to-date if we have any more information

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,440
 We will put in the announcements channel if you are going to complain immediately following me answering this question that there are no recent

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,800
 Announcements then I would like you to listen to this present again

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,380
 The updates are in the announcements channel if there are no updates

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,400
 They're the most up-to-date updates that we have it's a bit like Windows right no one really thinks about that, right?

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,220
 You know your own window actually windows is a bad idea

38
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,380
 I guess they update like all the time like you know it's like saying there are no recent updates

39
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,480
 It's like yeah, but like the most recent updates are there

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,440
 I had a DM from someone that said will support be coming soon. I don't know what that question means please answer questions in

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,220
 In the thread so I can get more information about those things

42
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,960
 sidewalk has another question here says any updates on stuff you've been excited to work on the stroke a look at

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,560
 Like personally I've been working a bunch of science projects, so those are cool

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,460
 I also was working yesterday on an updated document for the MMC to clarify license issues

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,220
 As you can find that in the MMC text channel that was a document which medros like this is this is needed

46
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,220
 We're having lots of questions and confusing

47
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,360
 No discussions about it, so I made a document summarizing licenses

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,720
 For those who are unaware in the MMC one of the rules stipulates that you must have a license to

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,800
 Use an asset in the MMC and that caused some confusion because apparently no one pays attention to licenses anywhere at all

50
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,500
 The loose principle of that is that when you download something from the internet you don't own it

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,600
 You might think that you automatically own it, but you don't

52
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,240
 when you download something you're usually given a

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,000
 license to that

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 sometimes it's

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,160
 Less clear than others, but even in games you're given the license. That's called the end user license agreement. It's a license to the game

56
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,600
 So if you don't have a license you can't use it. That's as simple as that

57
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,240
 So make sure that you're reading the downloads reading the license of anything that you've downloaded and check that documentation for more information

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,060
 Jackal says what has been the

59
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,980
 most surprising clever thing that you've seen someone do with logics. That's gonna have to be the

60
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,660
 Neural network world that was I think last year's MMC, but they did a whole neural network now

61
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,100
 It does only do pong which is quite a simple neural network with not that many nodes in between it

62
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,660
 But like the whole way that that was put together so that it is actually a neural network working logics is quite cool

63
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,040
 Additionally is the like the traffic

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,640
 NPC system the one that's got all the light little creatures that run around a village. That's really cool use

65
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,880
 Easton says gulp. I don't know what that means. Please elaborate

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,160
 Revy says have the servers been downgraded or heard people in myself noting the landfill server

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,440
 Nope, not to my knowledge. If you have any issues, please make sure that you're opening up a bug report

68
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,400
 There is a particular bug issue that you should go take a look at which is called

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,440
 Assets loading slowly or something like that is on our github and you can take a look at it

70
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,520
 I have a DM that says where do I post questions in the thread you?

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,680
 Okay, so you're on community meetings you go up one two, three four five channels

72
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,720
 You find the office hours text chat you click into the office hours text chat and then right at the bottom of the office hours text

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,880
 Chat the last message in there is a thread and you put questions in there

74
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,560
 If you have any difficulty with that, feel free to just DM me the question, but like it really should be

75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,240
 Easy to type in there

76
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,860
 Dio says is the logic structure like a neural net and I'm presuming I'm speaking about the neural network website. Sorry not website entry

77
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,180
 no, it's it is but

78
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,880
 the logics is just to

79
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,440
 Communicate with the nodes the nodes are like separate pieces of logics which are then called between each other

80
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,100
 I can't remember the exact specifics. I did unpack something and it looked really cool

81
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,520
 For those unaware when it comes down to like simple neural networks. It gets a lot easier to understand

82
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:06,040
 you connect an input and that say an input might be something very simple like the brightness of a pixel and

83
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,620
 Then the output might be move left move right and then based on that you can start doing

84
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:18,000
 Information so the neural network might say okay if I see a one on the brightness of a pixel

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Then I output one to move left

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,540
 and that is

87
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,580
 Just a very basic example

88
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,940
 If you think about it more and more and you look into like how it works you can start to really understand why

89
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,820
 really simple creatures are

90
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,900
 Really, you know what we call really simple because they have a smaller brain mass

91
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,320
 They have a smaller connectome. I believe is the term for it. Now you think about a fly maybe

92
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:50,080
 The fly is just responding to a very simple neural network, which is like seek food avoid people

93
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,100
 There is research to say that the size of brains doesn't matter as much as we thought though

94
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,460
 I seem to remember it was something like

95
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,420
 QI that TV show has been on my

96
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,740
 YouTube short feed for a bit and

97
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,140
 Something about like something about the size of the brain not being that more, you know, that my point

98
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,140
 It's like more the development of the brain

99
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:18,460
 Do clarifies I'm in terms of how graph based data structures are typically visualized by like this explanation more

100
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,420
 No logics is not structured like a neural net. Um

101
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,960
 Really don't understand the question. Oh, I skipped Eastern's question

102
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,780
 I don't know what that is. Like if it's a badge then I can go look at the badge code right now and see what's there

103
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,460
 Except I can't because my bookmarks broke to anyway, that would be

104
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,960
 common

105
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,760
 Avatar builder. Yeah, come on avatar build. All right scroll to the badges section

106
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,960
 There is no badge with that name, but there's no standard badge with that name

107
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,580
 It's probably a private badge or it might just be a tag. Like the problem is that people like associate tags with

108
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,900
 Like badges but like tags aren't badges tags are just tags much how worlds can have tags users can have tags and how we add

109
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:07,100
 Badges to people is usually via tags because it tags a user but tags don't always equate to badges

110
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
 They just sometimes do

111
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,080
 Yes, the neural network world is laid out like that a lot simpler than that, yes

112
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,480
 Beagle asks not sure how much you know about custom badge installation

113
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,360
 But I want to add a badge in but when I use the badge installer overwrites another badge I've edited and sets it back

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,720
 default once you've used the badge installer once I would just go ahead and take a look adding the badge manually to the badge installer

115
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,640
 It shouldn't be that difficult to go find the existing custom badges and add another one, but if you're using a community-based

116
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,680
 Integration then you should go speak to the member of the community that made that integration

117
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,540
 I can only help with real badges because I don't know

118
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,800
 I don't know like how that one works. It's usually

119
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,400
 Episcolians one that people use I don't know how it's work

120
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,480
 I don't use it because I have enough badges Beagle clarified that it's the custom badge thing

121
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,960
 Yeah, you'll have to speak to the the maker of the custom badge thing

122
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,400
 Yeah, corpse just a tag like you can see it there like it's literally it's just a tag like it's not a badge

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,080
 It's a tag

124
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,840
 So you see how this is like it says tags Neos team years admin that allows Fruxius and anyone else with those tags to perform

125
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,400
 Things that you guys can't for example I can I can delist an item from the world browser

126
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,680
 I can feature an item in the world browser. I can save stuff to the Neos team inventory like you know it's it's tagged

127
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,060
 It's not badges, so I would calm down and and enjoy

128
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,200
 Knowing that all badges are not tax moving forwards to questions

129
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,120
 maestro says

130
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
 Thank you. I'm in touch discord

131
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,100
 What is the license turns that I might need to know about if I want to do it for your project to say requirement?

132
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,260
 I mean the license terms of Neos

133
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:52,280
 Take a look at our end user license agreement and our terms of use as well as our user guidelines

134
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,980
 That's all you need to abide by you do whatever you want provided. You're abiding by those those are all available on the wiki and

135
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,040
 some are available like in in

136
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,960
 like in steam and stuff

137
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:11,360
 Eastern there is not a place on the wiki for tags because tags can be literally anything and the amount of tags that you'll see

138
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,820
 Will grow exponentially and they don't mean anything. There's also not a page for badges that are

139
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:24,920
 Eastern you need to just chill out because just to tag like it's meaningless right if you look at your world any world that you've published

140
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,780
 It's gonna have a tag for like everything that you put into the world name for example if you called the world

141
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,060
 The cool cabin by the sea it will have a tag

142
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,120
 That's called the because like our tag systems just like bad right now

143
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,260
 So it doesn't mean anything. It's just like it usually is signaled in behavior, right?

144
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,180
 It's exactly the same as slot tags, but the difference is in then that slot tags. You can only have one

145
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,460
 Because we don't have collections yet, whereas we do have collections in the API so you can't do that and we do have

146
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:05,360
 Collection like abilities for the world browser. That's also why the MMC uses tags and not the world name

147
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,480
 As a reminder for the MMC you do not need to put MMC or MMC 2023 or MMC 23

148
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,180
 In your world name just put it in the tags

149
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,000
 It's up to you

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,240
 But I've seen a bunch of worlds where they've like got like I don't know it still seems like people think that they need to

151
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,460
 Put it in the world name, which you do not all right moving forwards. That's done

152
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,560
 Wherever says have we turned you into a fairy yet? I don't know maybe you should find out

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,440
 Pam-pam says how am I today? I have pink lemonade. So I am amazing Jackal says, what is your favorite kind of cheese?

154
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,800
 I do not answer cheese questions because I answered them all search back through the notes

155
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,880
 Those who are unaware what pink lemonade is pink lemonade is lemonade that has

156
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,260
 Raspberry juice in it. Yeah, it's fine on the session names

157
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,680
 It's just like when I come to set up the I run the voting systems from see when I come to set up the voting system

158
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,880
 And I go into one of the voting booths and like the entire booth is just like water wall MMC

159
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,800
 It's so hard to find like a particular entry that you're interested in because they all start with MMC

160
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,320
 And you just look at like a sea of MMC space blah blah blah blah, and it's like what like just like what?

161
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,600
 You know just like here's an example. Let's say a

162
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,760
 Blockbuster film was entered into a competition and you go to the award ceremony, and it's like

163
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,720
 Congratulations

164
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,000
 MMC the shining has won the award for the best horror film and it's like

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,200
 Anyway, it's a matter of preference, but just know it's not required like if you still choose to put it in great

166
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,840
 It's just if you think you need to you do not

167
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,360
 Beagle says have you ever wanted to participate in MMC I participate in every single

168
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,740
 MMC do says we needed a vetted wiki article almost at misconceptions that go around Neos

169
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,940
 Yeah, well we've got optimization guidelines, which Lexus provided

170
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,020
 We've got myths

171
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,660
 Haven't actually updated in a while. That's because things calmed down. I guess but yeah his his myths

172
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,360
 And then we've got things to avoid as well

173
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,620
 Which I recently had to clarify that things to avoid didn't mean against the guidelines because we had a bunch of stuff around that

174
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,260
 But those three pages should help as for vetted. We don't like we don't really need them to be vetted

175
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,020
 I do check like edits that occur there, but

176
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,920
 What amazes me is that even with those pages in existence I still hear things which are like

177
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,060
 Literally on that page and I'd understand if they were on Twitter or a different platform because people may and we haven't read that

178
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:38,220
 But like I hear these things from like mentors and mod sometimes and it's like come on Beagle says

179
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,220
 What are you working on for this MMC? I don't have any plans right now

180
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,260
 What I usually do bear in mind I can't win is I've tended to sort of go for the art category

181
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,420
 So if you go back to MMC 2022, you'll see that I have an entry in the art category

182
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,060
 the reason behind that is because art is sort of like

183
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,580
 subjective and

184
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,860
 Open to interpretation and also quite creative. I don't actually need to spend a lot of time on logics, right?

185
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,780
 If I make a game I need to spend like hours making the logic for the game

186
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,900
 You know making sure all the parts work teams shooting whatever it is that needs to work works

187
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,660
 But if I do art, it just needs to look good and in some cases that means like silly stuff

188
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,200
 So the art project I did last year was based on I'm not gonna be able to find it

189
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,420
 There's there's a note in the world

190
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,400
 It's good untitled on purpose because I called it untitled and then lots of people DM me and were like you should title your project

191
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,760
 I'm like no

192
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,780
 No, it's untitled on purpose and so I just renamed it to untitled on purpose to meme this year's one will also be called untitled

193
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,380
 Yes, that is a perfect example of art

194
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:45,540
 Moving forward to additional questions Revy asks. I wonder why unity for rendering back when we picked unity

195
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,780
 It was probably the best option available. You have to remember the that Neos has existed since sort of before

196
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,460
 Before you can gather right? It's been a long time in the making

197
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,300
 Lots of people particularly in the crypto scene. They're like Neos has only existed since 2020

198
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,900
 I'm like no Neos has existed like as early as I think 16 17 or 18

199
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,020
 But it's you know, and it's like cool

200
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,900
 We used unity back then and we're kind of just stuck on it because we've been on it that long

201
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,500
 Like the very first sort of idea of Neos like almost predates the Oculus Rift, right?

202
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,420
 It was the Oculus Rift dev kits that the freaks was using to sort of pioneer this and look at it

203
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,860
 Some of the Neos code predates motion controllers for VR

204
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,100
 So back before you you had the vive ones before you had the oculus touch controllers

205
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,100
 In fact, there's a footage somewhere on his channel of him using you know

206
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,860
 That like razor controller thing that had like a sort of ball in the middle Hydra, I think yeah razor Hydra

207
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,060
 That would look really weird. I'm glad razor became less sort of like let's make stuff look like a alien movie. I

208
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,740
 Don't remember how that works. If anyone knows how the razor Hydra works. Let me know is it is it like what's the ball do?

209
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,920
 Magnetic. Oh, that's cool. Which reminds me. I've seen a recent uptick in controllers, but you use

210
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,480
 Magnetic sensors for the joystick which I think is great because it means they don't get as much drift because there isn't like moving parts

211
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,540
 There are still more moving parts, but like the moving parts are just moving parts

212
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,140
 They're less less like electronical and stuff like that. It also means that are easier to swap out etc. Yes ponder the razor Hydra orb

213
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,340
 Magnetic that's interesting. Yeah, Revy says hotspot connectors from an mechanical keyboards

214
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,260
 Yeah, similar to that like I can on this keyboard

215
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,360
 I've not done it because I don't need to I can pull off the key cap, of course

216
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,440
 But I can also pull out the key and just like throw it across the room go pick it up

217
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,060
 Put it back in again without unplugging the keyboard. It'll just work. My keyboard's cool. My keyboard uses lasers as well

218
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,620
 So the keys I have

219
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,640
 Don't mechanically interact with the circuit board at all

220
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:59,380
 All they do is lower a tiny piece of plastic that blocks an LED and that detects the block of the LED as a key

221
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:05,340
 Press it's ridiculous. Like it's absolutely ridiculous. The keyboard needs to do that, but it works nicely. I

222
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,860
 Can't adjust the strike depth. No

223
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:14,780
 That would be like like a price point increase. I wouldn't be prepared for I don't want to talk about keyboards too much because I

224
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:22,000
 Really do believe that over like over engineered and overplayed. I do not have any keyboard recommendations at all

225
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,180
 What I will tell you is

226
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:30,540
 Consider if you really need RGB or if you just think you need it. I've noticed a lot of people that like have RGB kit

227
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,580
 They just like let it do the sort of like RGB strobe where it just goes like I'm blue. I'm purple now

228
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,920
 I'm red now. I'm orange. I'm like, do you need do you need that?

229
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:45,800
 I recently went round my bedroom and I did the thing where you put electrical tape over all the LEDs and it's like oh, yeah

230
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,640
 Now like it's pitch black when I go to bed and I enjoy that

231
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,020
 So do you need light? Do you need it to have light? Oh, but it looks cool

232
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,940
 How long do you actually spend looking at your computer? How long I spent forever looking at it in

233
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,100
 in terms of looking at the screen, but I

234
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,180
 Remember the last time I like detailedly looked at the side of the PC case

235
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,480
 It might just be like how I've got mine set up, you know, do we have any more Neos questions?

236
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,860
 Let's get back to let's get back to Neos. Oh

237
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,420
 Hell yeah, we got three

238
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,620
 Neos questions, let's go through them

239
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,440
 After MMC, I'm looking to sorry Beagle says after MMC

240
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,840
 I'm looking to create an educational world of theoretical physics focusing on studies like black holes and whatnot

241
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,060
 What you've been just did working with me on it. Unfortunately, I can't commit to working on any

242
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,500
 Additional Neos projects. I just have too many and then Neos itself being a project

243
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,620
 It just it really ruins my mood for like working on stuff

244
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,340
 you'll know that if you know me enough to know that like occasionally I just make memes because

245
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,580
 Like it's easy to make memes because you can stop the moment. The joke isn't funny anymore

246
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,500
 Other than that like it's all full of like crazy projects. I don't have time

247
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,580
 Lex says well near scene be feet be

248
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,980
 Okay, sorry. I'm struggling to read for some reason be a feature eventually worked on when things get wrong again

249
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,060
 We still do plan to work on near scene and it will give us a lot more control over

250
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,020
 Testing and feature flagging and stuff like that

251
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,080
 Revvises are there any plans to support more DIY open source standards for eye and mouth tracking?

252
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:27,220
 Yeah, the way that that works is if we have a headset that has eye or mouth tracking will implement it like almost regardless, right?

253
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,980
 But we'll implement it at the speed and timing and planning as we do with all devices

254
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,600
 As for open source, I'm aware of a few standards. I don't know which standards winning right now

255
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,160
 But yeah, we'll take a look at it

256
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,160
 But we'll take a look at it framed around the headset and use like as an example here if there's only one person

257
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,760
 Using a headset. It's unlikely to get prioritized, but if someone comes in and says

258
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,080
 Five percent of your user base are using quest pros now right now and you don't support it

259
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:01,820
 That's a much easier conversation to have about supporting it. It's a bit like browsers like what percentage are using it in Explorer 6 guys

260
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
 Do you need to support Internet Explorer 6?

261
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,460
 if you're working in

262
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,640
 Corporate banking you do need to support Internet Explorer 6 usually. IE6 was out of support many many years ago

263
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,900
 But if you're in corporate banking you usually need it or if you're in a nuclear missile silo

264
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,980
 You kind of need to support like Internet Explorer 1 in some cases

265
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:26,000
 Not the Internet Explorer should be used inside a missile silo. Hopefully everything in there is like largely offline

266
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,860
 Look up and look into the silos and how they're operated by the way. It's kind of interesting

267
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,180
 some of those silos are manned 24/7 and

268
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,720
 They have various mechanics that basically mean that if like an officer leaves their chair like alarms go off and stuff because someone has to

269
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,980
 Be in their chair at that silo 24/7 just in case it's needed. It's it's interesting

270
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,640
 There's pictures of some of the rooms and it's just like that looks like a job which is

271
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,280
 Depending on how you look at it stressful or not stressful

272
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,280
 Because like if you're called on to like launch a missile then you know, the world's kind of messed up

273
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,480
 So there's nothing really you can do about it, but most of the time it's not gonna be so you just you know

274
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,740
 Sit there. I guess they'd run drills though a bit like firefighters, you know, like what I always used to think like

275
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,760
 Oh, you know firefighters do nothing when they're not on cool. No, they do drills or they clean

276
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,980
 Revvies clarify and they were talking about I track VR

277
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,980
 Which I should add I track into almost any headset go ahead and open up a cab issue for it

278
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,980
 We'll see if we can prioritize it

279
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,360
 Maestro asks is VR OS program app allowed to be developed or is that too far?

280
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,760
 Please restate that question. I have no idea what you're asking

281
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,020
 Jackal clarifies. Yeah maintenance is also what they do. Yeah it

282
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:38,400
 Yeah, I remember I was young I wanted to be a firefighter and a policeman at the same time

283
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,920
 We are at half past. So anyone that's typing go forward and and ask your questions

284
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,640
 Otherwise, we'll be leaving off here once we run out of questions. Okay, so Roussier's question first

285
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,900
 What's the determining factor when nodes go red is it based on a process time limit or max iterations?

286
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,200
 I'd have to look into it. Not entirely sure

287
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,640
 It's running time. I'm not I'm not entirely sure

288
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:00,960
 I'm sorry

289
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,680
 And the next question maestro says if I make the time to develop an OS around your program as a soft app

290
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,280
 Is built on top of the stack is their core limitation such as running it locally not being allowed as and I'd like to make

291
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,100
 The program you guys have linked to a server VM in the US would be provided by your program

292
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,920
 But the back end we provided by a programming IDE in VR logic would be placed on a separate server using web

293
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,440
 I don't think you'd have much luck doing that because we don't have things like screen sharing

294
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,040
 text editing of the kind that you are speaking about

295
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:40,300
 So I don't I just don't know I don't think half of what you're describing there would work though

296
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:46,500
 Particularly whilst we're on unity, but even once we're off unity that may require a commercial license depending on what you're doing on it

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 so, please go ahead and take a look at

298
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,400
 The terms of use and the guidelines and the end user license agreement if you have any more questions about that you can email

299
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
 hello at neos.com

300
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,480
 Shadow says could there be

301
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,280
 Controller emulation with logic's node be nice for making VR gloves work without external mapping

302
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,840
 We do have an item on our to-do list road map what we want to call it

303
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,560
 Which is more sort of generic device support and what that would allow you to do is make

304
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,240
 In a similar way, but not identical to a plug-in a way for your device, whatever it might be including

305
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,040
 You know if you built it using circuit boards and an Arduino yourself

306
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,700
 Support Neo, so that's probably what you're after I believe that's on one of our roadmap boards with that

307
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,320
 I'm gonna go ahead and call things closed. That's the end of this office hours if any additional questions

308
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 please post in questions and help or

309
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,020
 DM me or I don't know like send me a carrier pigeon if you do that

310
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,060
 Let me know though because like my curtains are still closed

311
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:46,480
 I won't see outside on my balcony and making pigeon noises at me, and I will see you again next week
