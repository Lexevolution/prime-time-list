1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.100
So now we're recording fantastic. So welcome again to office hours. If you have any questions, please drop them in the office hours chat

2
0:00:06.100 --> 0:00:08.340
There is two channels above this one

3
0:00:09.180 --> 0:00:13.180
Office dash hours drop any questions you have in there. I did just check the

4
0:00:14.040 --> 0:00:18.340
Question sheet as well. I keep forgetting to check and there are no questions locked there. So we're good on that

5
0:00:18.860 --> 0:00:22.520
Until there are any questions, we're gonna sit here in unimaginable pain and silence

6
0:00:23.020 --> 0:00:26.700
So get those questions in for those just joining welcome to office hours

7
0:00:26.700 --> 0:00:30.900
If you have any questions, you'd like to ask me about news, please drop them in the office hours channel

8
0:00:30.900 --> 0:00:32.900
That is two above the current one that you're in

9
0:00:33.180 --> 0:00:36.720
Any questions go for okay, so we have some questions coming in. That's great

10
0:00:37.040 --> 0:00:40.500
So I have a question from epic Eastern that says what's stopping you from working on news

11
0:00:40.500 --> 0:00:44.900
Is it legal mumbo-jumbo? And what if your modifications are completely local? There's still problems of that

12
0:00:45.540 --> 0:00:49.600
There are no problems of either of that like I can technically work on this if I would like to

13
0:00:50.000 --> 0:00:53.980
We just can't release it right now. I do still work on here

14
0:00:53.980 --> 0:00:56.920
So I have the code base open most days to just answer questions here

15
0:00:57.140 --> 0:01:01.380
Someone's like how does XYZ component work and I've never heard of that could put it in my life

16
0:01:01.380 --> 0:01:03.380
You bet I'm gonna go to the code and read how it works

17
0:01:03.860 --> 0:01:08.020
It's really useful in that case to sort of you know, just be like cool. I can open the curtain take a look

18
0:01:08.020 --> 0:01:13.560
I have some local changes as well. I keep seeing for those who use version control systems

19
0:01:13.560 --> 0:01:16.980
I go into the code base and I look at my git changes and I'm just like whoa

20
0:01:17.500 --> 0:01:21.980
There's a lot of changes and some files here and I'm forgetting what those are. So sometimes I commit them

21
0:01:21.980 --> 0:01:24.740
Into branches so that I've got a list of branches

22
0:01:24.740 --> 0:01:29.980
I need to push once we're able to make updates like I just saw one which was another invalid default

23
0:01:31.060 --> 0:01:33.980
corner quaternary and quaternion

24
0:01:34.700 --> 0:01:38.700
Made a bunch of components which would default to invalid quaternions

25
0:01:41.220 --> 0:01:44.740
Float is they were default to invalid float queues and

26
0:01:45.960 --> 0:01:50.620
We were fixing up a bunch, but we missed some and people reported that and I'm like, that's an easy fix

27
0:01:50.620 --> 0:01:54.500
I've got like a bunch of those that I was just seeing I'm like, what did I change in this file?

28
0:01:54.500 --> 0:01:58.620
I'm like, oh I changed that to make it a valid float queue

29
0:01:59.340 --> 0:02:01.220
cool

30
0:02:01.220 --> 0:02:02.420
Okay

31
0:02:02.420 --> 0:02:05.100
Next question now, I've stopped saying that terrible word

32
0:02:05.820 --> 0:02:06.980
q

33
0:02:06.980 --> 0:02:12.140
From Lex who says what be a good way of setting up a seamless transition between worlds for larger experiences

34
0:02:12.140 --> 0:02:19.060
So the open world and focus world node are great when you combine them together because the open world node allows you to sort of

35
0:02:19.060 --> 0:02:23.740
Detect when a world is loaded. It's the only way that you can do that. I'm not quite sure how reliable that is

36
0:02:24.220 --> 0:02:26.220
But you can totally do that

37
0:02:26.460 --> 0:02:28.460
What I would recommend there is

38
0:02:29.140 --> 0:02:31.140
Thinking about how you have someone

39
0:02:32.020 --> 0:02:33.980
Start that transition is very important

40
0:02:33.980 --> 0:02:39.660
I see lots of people who want world portals, you know similar to to VR chats world portals those work

41
0:02:39.660 --> 0:02:44.820
Well what I suggest you do for those though is that you when someone hits the portal

42
0:02:44.820 --> 0:02:50.500
Instead of just opening the world they are doing anything there teleport them like under the map or something

43
0:02:50.740 --> 0:02:55.340
put something on their head that looks like a loading screen then trigger the load and

44
0:02:56.460 --> 0:03:02.540
Then focus the world once that loading has has concluded that way you emulate the process of them

45
0:03:02.780 --> 0:03:06.220
Disappearing when they enter the portal even if they're just sort of under the map

46
0:03:06.940 --> 0:03:11.580
You know flailing their arms around etc, but then you can put that visual effect on top

47
0:03:11.580 --> 0:03:17.300
I've seen a couple of sort of experiments. We're doing that with with various visual effects

48
0:03:17.780 --> 0:03:21.500
I'm sure I would love to see if you there's a few I'd like to see is hey

49
0:03:21.840 --> 0:03:28.780
Remember the original long stargate transition they stopped doing it after like the first few episodes on

50
0:03:29.040 --> 0:03:31.660
The stargate TV show they did it both times

51
0:03:31.660 --> 0:03:34.880
There was a stargate trip on the original film because it was very impactful

52
0:03:35.380 --> 0:03:38.420
But on the actual show it made no sense because they just kept doing it

53
0:03:38.420 --> 0:03:44.020
If you watch stargate as well you'll notice the first couple of episodes they have a frosty effect

54
0:03:44.420 --> 0:03:50.660
When people come through they're like oh, they're they're like skin is frosty like they've been out in a snowstorm or whatever

55
0:03:50.660 --> 0:03:57.020
But they remove that afterwards and they never really explain that I mean you can just sort of hand-babe and say they fixed it

56
0:03:57.020 --> 0:04:02.340
But that doesn't make sense for an outgoing trip because the outgoing trip is like how it was intended to work

57
0:04:02.340 --> 0:04:09.380
Yeah, everything about like the the stargate command base is like hacked together because they didn't have like a complete system

58
0:04:09.640 --> 0:04:14.760
But everything off world should be perfectly fine, so if it was like yeah, they fixed it doesn't make any sense anyway

59
0:04:15.560 --> 0:04:20.720
So yeah, I a good stargate transition would be cool. I know that the

60
0:04:22.000 --> 0:04:25.400
Always forget the name of it, but it's like open every day the headless session

61
0:04:25.400 --> 0:04:29.840
Which has swap spheres made by Ray V would be another way to do dual-world transition

62
0:04:29.840 --> 0:04:35.320
They're great swap spheres come from the game abduction. You could also just do a standard loading screen

63
0:04:36.040 --> 0:04:37.200
Just try some stuff out

64
0:04:37.200 --> 0:04:39.080
Maybe I'll add that to my tutorial list

65
0:04:39.080 --> 0:04:43.520
But you will need to use the node for that there are components that can do world portal openings

66
0:04:43.520 --> 0:04:48.520
But what they will do is load you into the world immediately, so what you'll see there is basically

67
0:04:49.920 --> 0:04:55.640
Similar to this is another random tangent, but as we never know there were questions. It's tangent prime time with prime

68
0:04:55.640 --> 0:04:59.640
If you just do a portal with the components for a while transition

69
0:04:59.960 --> 0:05:06.640
They will instantly shell out the moment they they touch the portal and so it

70
0:05:07.160 --> 0:05:08.560
resembles that

71
0:05:08.560 --> 0:05:10.560
veil, I think it's called in

72
0:05:11.280 --> 0:05:16.120
Harry Potter it's order the Phoenix where it happens where Sirius black is down in the department of

73
0:05:16.920 --> 0:05:18.720
mysteries, I think it is

74
0:05:18.720 --> 0:05:20.720
in the Ministry of Magic and

75
0:05:20.720 --> 0:05:26.280
He just accidentally I think he sort of knocked into it in the films, but in the book

76
0:05:26.280 --> 0:05:29.080
I think he like accidentally ends up being sort of pushed into there

77
0:05:30.200 --> 0:05:33.960
He falls into the veil and immediately turns into a ghost and just disappears

78
0:05:33.960 --> 0:05:38.160
And there's no real explanation of what magic is at play there, but like they know he's dead

79
0:05:38.880 --> 0:05:44.080
That's what it looks like they're just sort of like they touch the portal and then they instantly turn transparent

80
0:05:44.080 --> 0:05:48.120
It's like cool, and then they hang around there until they decide to close the world

81
0:05:48.120 --> 0:05:54.200
Whereas if you manually use the the open world and focus world nodes you can actually do a full-on transition

82
0:05:54.200 --> 0:05:58.480
You can start opening the world to teleport them under the ground wait for it to load once

83
0:05:58.480 --> 0:06:02.400
It's loaded close the world that they were in focus the new one a lot a lot cleaner

84
0:06:02.640 --> 0:06:08.560
Something that could also be cool is if you did like a level transition like I know some games do level transitions weirdly

85
0:06:09.360 --> 0:06:14.000
Where they I could example being like one of the early Resident Evil games

86
0:06:14.000 --> 0:06:20.760
They have that door opening animation that was both to say like hey you're going through a door and also to load another part of

87
0:06:20.760 --> 0:06:24.520
The map other games do it with you know corridors you walk down this corridor

88
0:06:24.520 --> 0:06:28.480
And they realize like hey you're on like the cusp between two levels here

89
0:06:28.480 --> 0:06:34.120
So we can load the next level and if you turn around just panic and unload that next level and load the previous level

90
0:06:34.120 --> 0:06:39.320
But the corridor is like in both so you can link those together so again. You can make something seamless there. There's the

91
0:06:39.320 --> 0:06:45.160
The Metal Gear Solid ladder climbing world that'd be a good example like if you're halfway up the ladder like

92
0:06:45.960 --> 0:06:50.160
Load the top of the ladder, but if you're not done moving onwards to more questions here

93
0:06:50.960 --> 0:06:55.560
Specs says the desktop view in the dash is great, but it gets pretty hard to read of screens

94
0:06:55.560 --> 0:06:59.280
I have especially wide resolutions the dash seems to be hard coded best fit

95
0:06:59.960 --> 0:07:03.280
16.9 screens is anything I could do as a user to make my admittedly silly

96
0:07:03.280 --> 0:07:11.760
32.9 screen fit better in the dash or more readable the the problem that you have is that the headset itself

97
0:07:11.760 --> 0:07:14.560
Isn't isn't anywhere near 32.9

98
0:07:15.080 --> 0:07:19.680
I guess making the dash bigger would allow for that

99
0:07:19.680 --> 0:07:27.880
But you'd probably need like a non a non 16.9 dash size. There's probably a way to like resize the dash temporarily

100
0:07:27.880 --> 0:07:31.560
I'm not sure if it would save but that would give you the resolution there

101
0:07:31.560 --> 0:07:35.680
What I wouldn't want to do is any sort of ladder boxing where we try and squeeze that in and narrow it down

102
0:07:35.680 --> 0:07:37.680
She's just gonna lose more detail

103
0:07:38.320 --> 0:07:40.520
That's all I got for you make make the dash bigger

104
0:07:40.640 --> 0:07:44.000
You might be able to do that in-game without any sort of modifications or anything like that

105
0:07:44.000 --> 0:07:46.720
Just go ahead and inspect and use this base see if it saves

106
0:07:47.360 --> 0:07:54.920
Otherwise, you'll have to go into Nia's modding land. See if you can get it done there. You basically need like a better like

107
0:07:55.360 --> 0:07:56.360
a

108
0:07:56.360 --> 0:08:01.880
Better rectangle that can then fit that in and I think changing the size of the dash is probably any way you can to do

109
0:08:01.880 --> 0:08:02.800
that

110
0:08:02.800 --> 0:08:07.040
Rampers just asked for an RSS feed. I've got to scroll back because we actually I linked one a

111
0:08:08.080 --> 0:08:12.580
While ago, I linked one. Yeah, it's here. I'll add it to the wiki if I remember. Oh

112
0:08:13.200 --> 0:08:20.480
Froppy is like so fast. Yeah, there's the RSS feed. I will see if I can like put that on the wiki or something

113
0:08:20.480 --> 0:08:26.520
I'll take a note and then inevitably forget, but I will take a note where I what is it Tuesday? It is Tuesday. I

114
0:08:27.040 --> 0:08:29.040
Had RSS link to office

115
0:08:31.080 --> 0:08:34.400
It's on my to-do list like ultrawides are always causing strange

116
0:08:35.480 --> 0:08:38.320
Strange problems. I know them like some professional

117
0:08:39.080 --> 0:08:44.520
Esports they're banned because the game handles them and and does them really really well

118
0:08:44.520 --> 0:08:50.400
But the peripheral vision that you get is then an advantage and then because not all people have them

119
0:08:50.480 --> 0:08:53.480
They've just like banned them or something which seems strange

120
0:08:53.480 --> 0:08:59.600
I mean if it's like pro pro pro eSports just buy everyone a giant monitor has a benefit go for it

121
0:08:59.600 --> 0:09:02.840
I'm actually dealing with that problem right now in another sense as well, which is

122
0:09:03.360 --> 0:09:06.320
during the steam sale a game called Hydra near was on sale and

123
0:09:07.600 --> 0:09:10.440
It has multiplayer, but it doesn't have online multiplayer

124
0:09:10.440 --> 0:09:14.840
So you have to do steam remote play with a split-screen or to play and so a friend has

125
0:09:15.120 --> 0:09:19.240
Purchased the game and I was about to purchase it until I realized there's no online multiplayer

126
0:09:19.240 --> 0:09:22.920
So I saved my money and now we play it split-screen over steam remote play

127
0:09:22.920 --> 0:09:27.140
but it's a split-screen and so they have an ultra wide and they were trying to fit like

128
0:09:28.280 --> 0:09:32.120
This split-screen game on an ultra wide and it looks terrible

129
0:09:32.760 --> 0:09:36.520
We got some solutions and I'm mostly used to it. It's kind of strange

130
0:09:36.520 --> 0:09:41.160
Sometimes I forget it's split-screen and end up trying to control both characters, even though I'm only one character

131
0:09:41.840 --> 0:09:46.620
If the Hydra near devs are listening, please add proper multiplayer, please

132
0:09:47.360 --> 0:09:53.400
They've quoted that they don't they're not able to add proper multiplayer right now to you to sort of resource constraints

133
0:09:53.400 --> 0:09:56.720
Which is perfectly understandable. It's a lot of of endeavor to take

134
0:09:57.280 --> 0:09:58.920
but you know

135
0:09:58.920 --> 0:10:05.760
Try please cry. So ramp is is remote play and the tech there is great. I agree. The tech is there is great

136
0:10:05.760 --> 0:10:11.240
What are the only thing I don't really like about remote play is it kind of feels like I lose control of my computer

137
0:10:11.240 --> 0:10:16.220
If I'm the host, well, it's it's a it's a it's an exchange like it's it's something you have to get used to

138
0:10:16.480 --> 0:10:21.040
But like, you know, there's always a point where I need to like maybe alt tab and look something up

139
0:10:21.040 --> 0:10:24.040
And if I alt tab the other player loses control of the game

140
0:10:24.160 --> 0:10:27.160
And so it feels like you're kind of holding your computer hostage a little bit

141
0:10:27.160 --> 0:10:31.760
So it's a little bit weird, but it's really nice saves people money stuff like that

142
0:10:31.760 --> 0:10:36.200
Next we have a question from Lex who says the dash uses modal overlays on uix

143
0:10:36.200 --> 0:10:39.120
Would it be a good idea to use those components for own uix pop-ups?

144
0:10:39.800 --> 0:10:41.800
Yes, and no

145
0:10:42.080 --> 0:10:49.540
The pop-ups are great, but you have little control over how they work because they use a couple of sort of delegate II things

146
0:10:50.720 --> 0:10:53.400
Now I know mods can get you access to that

147
0:10:54.400 --> 0:10:59.220
But like I wouldn't be sure if you would have the ability to control exactly how you would like to

148
0:10:59.220 --> 0:11:05.060
what I did for the MMC voting system, which does use a modal overlay is I

149
0:11:06.500 --> 0:11:12.200
Created a modal in the regular world browser and then like pulled

150
0:11:12.620 --> 0:11:16.540
quite brutally the entire modal out of the world manager and

151
0:11:17.580 --> 0:11:20.420
Converted it to my own system that was powered by dynamic variable

152
0:11:20.700 --> 0:11:27.040
So it's still like loads and looks exactly like the same modal that you have but it doesn't use those those modal components

153
0:11:27.040 --> 0:11:33.780
It does use a lot of the sort of visual components of a modal. It just doesn't use the like Neos modal component

154
0:11:33.780 --> 0:11:35.540
Whatever it's called

155
0:11:35.540 --> 0:11:36.860
your

156
0:11:36.860 --> 0:11:40.100
Approach might vary but that's what I ended up doing

157
0:11:40.100 --> 0:11:46.060
I did speak to fruits at the time of developing it and they said the modal could be expanded to allow

158
0:11:46.660 --> 0:11:52.800
Other users to do you know have modals use modals etc, but that that wasn't supported right now. Keep those questions coming

159
0:11:52.800 --> 0:11:56.900
We have about 10 or so minutes left on the the office hours happen

160
0:11:57.100 --> 0:12:00.340
sometimes I run over that huge because I'm ranting about cheese or something, but

161
0:12:01.060 --> 0:12:07.700
Carry on. Hey Kip as a question. Is there a way to use a material as a texture input for another material?

162
0:12:07.700 --> 0:12:13.460
The only way I've seen to do that is to use a camera that happens a lot like a lot more than you realize

163
0:12:14.900 --> 0:12:16.900
Trying to think of some examples

164
0:12:16.900 --> 0:12:23.340
Like neoto shop in the polylogics folder is a good example of that that uses a camera to

165
0:12:24.660 --> 0:12:26.660
render the

166
0:12:26.700 --> 0:12:28.700
like the final composition

167
0:12:29.260 --> 0:12:32.020
Neota shop is basically stacked brush pixels

168
0:12:32.020 --> 0:12:36.740
so they usually they have the sort of base texture at the back and then in front of that or any number of sort of

169
0:12:36.740 --> 0:12:41.540
Brush layers and then on the front of that is a camera that's looking at all those layers combined

170
0:12:41.540 --> 0:12:48.540
And so you remove that 3d effect of those stacked layers and get back to a flat image like says any curved UX really?

171
0:12:48.540 --> 0:12:53.100
Yeah, um the actual dash does that same concept?

172
0:12:53.380 --> 0:12:59.420
What we do is we take a flat version of the dash and then project it on to the curved

173
0:13:00.700 --> 0:13:02.740
Curved plane mesh so it can be curved

174
0:13:02.740 --> 0:13:06.620
I have the curvature set to zero on my dash because I can't really stand it

175
0:13:06.620 --> 0:13:09.140
I know other people like it, but like I'm just like what?

176
0:13:09.140 --> 0:13:13.300
So have a look at those. There's a couple of worlds that do it as well

177
0:13:14.780 --> 0:13:20.180
Using the same concept as like build as a neoto shop building a key to an early

178
0:13:20.340 --> 0:13:25.460
World by myself that let you sort of customize what your a key to model by zap uses it

179
0:13:26.540 --> 0:13:28.540
my MMC

180
0:13:28.740 --> 0:13:35.620
2022 entry entitled on purpose uses it for the well poles are in both sides of that room check that if you like

181
0:13:35.620 --> 0:13:40.580
It's an artistic piece that is open for interpretation art is always subjective so have fun

182
0:13:41.420 --> 0:13:46.020
That uses it various other places use it vigil abo's water droplets

183
0:13:46.020 --> 0:13:49.820
I know other people have done it but like vigil abo's is the one that comes to mind if you go into their public folder

184
0:13:49.820 --> 0:13:54.740
They've got a water example where you can kind of like put your hands in the water and it splashes a bit that

185
0:13:55.100 --> 0:13:57.100
Again uses a camera. Oh

186
0:13:57.460 --> 0:13:59.140
and

187
0:13:59.140 --> 0:14:01.140
snow globe of working snow

188
0:14:01.140 --> 0:14:08.660
That also has it that's how we do the the like footprints in the snow thing moving onwards to hack 13s question

189
0:14:08.740 --> 0:14:10.460
Who says I?

190
0:14:10.460 --> 0:14:14.820
Wanted to know if I wanted to hide a string inside of Neos that I want to pass to a web socket or something

191
0:14:14.820 --> 0:14:19.140
I've seen the cloud bears don't show their data to someone who isn't on the allowed list which consider that a good way of hiding

192
0:14:19.140 --> 0:14:26.020
Something like that example in a bi key. No, I do not recommend any form of authentication in logics or Neos at all right now

193
0:14:26.020 --> 0:14:30.340
The only way I would like say it's acceptable is if you have a private world with one person in it

194
0:14:30.340 --> 0:14:37.660
Otherwise like who knows what they're doing. You've also got the problem there of like however secure

195
0:14:37.660 --> 0:14:43.340
It is if it's let's say it's an API key. Let's say it's in a cloud variable at a certain point either via

196
0:14:44.740 --> 0:14:46.740
components or maybe a logics ribbon

197
0:14:46.860 --> 0:14:52.460
that value is extracted from that sort of in quotes secure environment only one person can read and

198
0:14:52.820 --> 0:14:59.220
Passed to a field which anyone can read and so that's why it's not secure like example area like if say you did

199
0:14:59.220 --> 0:15:06.900
I don't know read cloud variable and of course require variable can only read like a user's value for example that

200
0:15:07.980 --> 0:15:12.620
You might think that's secure right because only this user only has this value and due to the cloud very permissions

201
0:15:12.620 --> 0:15:16.420
I've set up so only the user can read their own value that sounds kind of secure

202
0:15:16.420 --> 0:15:19.180
But it's not because that read cloud variable node

203
0:15:19.340 --> 0:15:25.140
Then outputs just a standard string with no protection and so let's say we then plug that require variable node

204
0:15:25.140 --> 0:15:32.420
It's output into on a regular write node to then write it into a string registrar ever that string register is just

205
0:15:33.220 --> 0:15:37.740
Publicly readable there are advancements in sort of the feature called hard permissions

206
0:15:37.740 --> 0:15:42.780
Which may allow for more sort of secure related things, but anything that has authentication

207
0:15:42.780 --> 0:15:47.980
I don't recommend doing or trying to sort of work around it good example here being the

208
0:15:48.660 --> 0:15:53.240
MMC voting world in the MMC voting world I disable cloud avatars

209
0:15:53.240 --> 0:15:57.460
I disable all locomotion except one I disable two shelves

210
0:15:57.460 --> 0:16:01.380
I disable like basically everything and even with that

211
0:16:01.540 --> 0:16:05.740
It's still not secure, and that's why we have logging up the wazoo right I

212
0:16:06.340 --> 0:16:08.940
At the end of every MMC voting I go through the logs

213
0:16:08.940 --> 0:16:14.820
And I pair things up a good example being I can go through the logs of the session from the header server

214
0:16:14.820 --> 0:16:16.780
And I can say like oh hey look

215
0:16:16.780 --> 0:16:18.780
prime joined at

216
0:16:18.780 --> 0:16:24.980
1624 and then I look at my list of votes on the voting server, and I'm like prime joined at 1624

217
0:16:24.980 --> 0:16:27.980
And then he made three votes at 1624 great

218
0:16:27.980 --> 0:16:32.540
I can I can match those up and still be unsure because there's still some issues that might occur there

219
0:16:32.540 --> 0:16:38.140
But I can still audit that and be like ah it looks like that makes sense right that makes sense

220
0:16:38.780 --> 0:16:44.580
But like if I see prime joins at 1624 and then Fruxius made a bunch of votes

221
0:16:44.580 --> 0:16:50.100
But Fruxius wasn't actually in the world at the time then I'm like hmm looks like prime was doing something weird

222
0:16:50.420 --> 0:16:56.740
Better throw those votes out so hack 13 has gone to say that they have an intermediary API that holds the key and

223
0:16:57.540 --> 0:17:01.700
The in the issue just pass request to it that is good because

224
0:17:02.420 --> 0:17:04.520
You are in control there again

225
0:17:04.520 --> 0:17:10.820
You can add like additional security for example the outgoing service that you're trying to connect to that needs an API key

226
0:17:10.820 --> 0:17:16.640
Might have rate limits that you know you usually won't exceed, but maybe you put like slightly more

227
0:17:17.220 --> 0:17:21.980
strenuous or strict rate limits on your intermediary API because there is that level of sort of

228
0:17:22.220 --> 0:17:24.940
Ambiguity about who's doing it and that way you can protect

229
0:17:25.900 --> 0:17:28.500
Your API key and your network from having

230
0:17:29.060 --> 0:17:32.940
Too many requests compared to just going direct and stuff like that

231
0:17:32.940 --> 0:17:36.220
You can always put that layer in the middle there and add a little bit more sort of scrutiny

232
0:17:36.420 --> 0:17:40.220
Moving on to Lex's question is there a good way of detecting when someone is live through components

233
0:17:40.220 --> 0:17:44.220
I believe that there is a component for it excuse me moment

234
0:17:44.900 --> 0:17:50.780
The component is what drives the live badge above someone's head the problem with that though

235
0:17:50.780 --> 0:17:56.380
is that if they are not using the mirror to display option on the streaming camera or

236
0:17:58.580 --> 0:18:04.920
Something like that or forcing that live badge on which is another option then they could be they could be live

237
0:18:04.920 --> 0:18:12.640
Just using the Steam VR mirror or the direct output of the of the monitor view the desktop view of it

238
0:18:13.040 --> 0:18:16.440
Kip says good idea to like always assume that you're on camera

239
0:18:17.280 --> 0:18:20.540
Absolutely always assume you're on camera. I'm kind of sort of

240
0:18:21.560 --> 0:18:23.560
indoctrinated into that which is

241
0:18:24.720 --> 0:18:27.540
Strange that came from the sort of the mixer days when I worked at mixer

242
0:18:27.540 --> 0:18:31.940
It was like hey, you know everything you do wherever you are assume

243
0:18:31.940 --> 0:18:38.560
You're being recorded in the sort of streaming space less so in games, but like everywhere. I use the name probable crime

244
0:18:38.560 --> 0:18:44.880
I'm like yep. I'm marine recorded. You don't know about my old accounts. Yeah, I'm gonna hack the matrix of my old accounts

245
0:18:47.040 --> 0:18:49.040
Moving forwards

246
0:18:49.480 --> 0:18:50.560
to

247
0:18:50.560 --> 0:18:51.840
Lexie says

248
0:18:51.840 --> 0:18:52.880
Same question as Bob

249
0:18:52.880 --> 0:18:57.280
But detecting permission levels in world for example if you want to set up a builders only zone

250
0:18:57.280 --> 0:19:04.240
You can't do that right now now. I know that someone in here is going to start typing about the two-string node

251
0:19:04.240 --> 0:19:07.060
And I get tired of talking about the two-string node

252
0:19:07.060 --> 0:19:11.700
But I'm going to talk about it again because hey this is being recorded and anyone that listens will hear this feel

253
0:19:12.180 --> 0:19:19.720
Before a certain update the two-string node would allow you to receive a text based output from a user

254
0:19:19.980 --> 0:19:23.540
that included their permission level to string is a

255
0:19:24.300 --> 0:19:26.300
debug process on

256
0:19:26.300 --> 0:19:29.860
Much much of programming on second was a cough off Mike

257
0:19:30.340 --> 0:19:35.200
And so in programming you use a two-string operator lock for debugging and logging

258
0:19:35.460 --> 0:19:40.500
So two-string would be like I don't know what this is dot to string it and it gives you lots of details

259
0:19:40.780 --> 0:19:47.300
That process is designed to give you a text based representation of the object at its current moment

260
0:19:47.500 --> 0:19:51.460
It's not designed to pass that data back out into any other form

261
0:19:51.460 --> 0:19:55.780
but what users were doing is running a bunch of substring operations on that two-string output and

262
0:19:56.580 --> 0:20:00.740
It was causing a problem that is not intended way to use to string it

263
0:20:00.740 --> 0:20:06.260
Never was so the fact it worked was actually just a miracle like it's just a miracle right it was just random

264
0:20:06.620 --> 0:20:13.300
Frukes made edits to the two-string output to include that and had forgotten that he'd done that and it was purely for logging as

265
0:20:13.300 --> 0:20:18.620
We changed that such that the two-string output is now more stable and will never change and

266
0:20:19.260 --> 0:20:20.900
the

267
0:20:20.900 --> 0:20:25.620
Response to that was you remove the role information and it's like yeah

268
0:20:25.620 --> 0:20:31.060
You shouldn't have had that in the first place and people go like well why and the reason is because again the security principle

269
0:20:31.140 --> 0:20:37.900
You take a known object which has a known property permission and you change it to a string and then you start doing operations on

270
0:20:37.900 --> 0:20:38.900
that string

271
0:20:38.900 --> 0:20:40.360
substring

272
0:20:40.360 --> 0:20:46.780
Index of string etc. And then out of that you get a single string which shows their permission level that string could be intercepted

273
0:20:46.780 --> 0:20:51.900
By any number of mechanisms points at the modding community who are mostly good by the way

274
0:20:51.900 --> 0:20:53.980
This isn't a modding community is bad

275
0:20:53.980 --> 0:20:57.260
This is just the modding community have the ability to do this

276
0:20:57.380 --> 0:21:01.580
So should a bad actor and again not accusing the modding community of being bad actors

277
0:21:01.620 --> 0:21:06.580
They are fantastic with the mods that they are producing but a modding person could

278
0:21:07.420 --> 0:21:12.260
Theoretically edit that string in place using a mod and give you a different output

279
0:21:12.260 --> 0:21:17.860
So let's say you had a system where you're like, oh if they're a builder show this really sensitive piece of information

280
0:21:17.860 --> 0:21:20.780
Or allow this sensitive access to the world they could

281
0:21:21.500 --> 0:21:25.020
Theoretically again not using anyone don't take this out of context

282
0:21:26.060 --> 0:21:27.500
Bypass something important

283
0:21:27.500 --> 0:21:34.300
So that's why it's not allowed in the future when it is a secure option that we can allow you to receive the permission level

284
0:21:34.300 --> 0:21:40.860
Of someone securely and take a look at it securely. We will allow you to do it until then it is not secure

285
0:21:40.860 --> 0:21:46.020
So we're not allowing you to do it specs has a question here, which isn't marked with the emote. So it was a marking

286
0:21:48.780 --> 0:21:51.860
But I guess it doesn't have a question mark, but we'll go to it

287
0:21:51.860 --> 0:21:54.500
So we'd love to hear about making builder on his own

288
0:21:54.500 --> 0:21:59.540
So although it's restricting errors for using things like deb sips within the only surefire way to do that right now is

289
0:22:00.500 --> 0:22:04.460
Socially or like community wise a good thing

290
0:22:05.300 --> 0:22:09.700
That I've seen a lot of people do is they put more rules in the rules and we have had some issues with that

291
0:22:09.700 --> 0:22:13.500
But they put more rules in their world. It can be anything like going back to that

292
0:22:14.340 --> 0:22:16.740
That world the headless what I can't remember the name of it

293
0:22:17.540 --> 0:22:22.020
But it's again the one with swap spheres that rahivi did there is a big sign there

294
0:22:23.740 --> 0:22:30.540
With the truth Ozi and next Ozi is like please do logics in the nerd dome or some sort of phrasing like that

295
0:22:30.540 --> 0:22:34.580
I knew it was something simple like the sandbox, but I didn't want to be incorrect and

296
0:22:34.580 --> 0:22:40.580
That is a perfectly reasonable way of doing it, right? It's a sign that says please do logics in the nerd dome

297
0:22:40.580 --> 0:22:44.980
And like I will do logics in the nerd dome if I ever want to do logics in that world

298
0:22:44.980 --> 0:22:47.820
And if I'm not doing logics in the node

299
0:22:48.340 --> 0:22:55.460
The the nerd dome then cool. I would expect someone for example Ozi to come over and be like

300
0:22:55.460 --> 0:22:57.260
Yo, take it to the nerd dome

301
0:22:57.260 --> 0:23:02.100
That's a cultural way of doing it if you want to restrict it technically or functionally right now

302
0:23:02.100 --> 0:23:08.700
There are some things you can do, but I'm probably not going to recommend any of them because they will all break

303
0:23:08.740 --> 0:23:15.180
Depending on what as a community we need to come up with sort of like ways of I'm gonna cough again one second

304
0:23:15.180 --> 0:23:19.900
I hope I'm not getting sick, but maybe today is just a coughing day. I'll go drink some water later

305
0:23:20.740 --> 0:23:24.580
I hope as a community we can come up with ways of basically being more reasonable about rules

306
0:23:24.580 --> 0:23:29.460
I have had lots of problems of having rules in my sessions with people being like hard done by or

307
0:23:29.460 --> 0:23:35.980
Problematic about them or arguing about them, but it's just like if I go to your house not peeking anywhere here

308
0:23:35.980 --> 0:23:38.140
but Ozi if I go to your house and

309
0:23:38.740 --> 0:23:44.060
I come in with a bag of horse manure, and I start throwing it everywhere

310
0:23:44.220 --> 0:23:46.660
You're going to be quite annoyed of me and kick me out

311
0:23:46.940 --> 0:23:52.460
You don't have a rule on the wall of your house that says don't throw horse manure in my in my property

312
0:23:52.660 --> 0:23:54.660
But I know that that's unacceptable

313
0:23:54.660 --> 0:23:59.820
It's so if we start with that level of foundation we can then move forwards, which is I now know

314
0:23:59.820 --> 0:24:04.420
What is unacceptable in general society? Oh look? There's actually rules posted?

315
0:24:04.420 --> 0:24:10.540
I will add to add these rules to my general understanding of what is acceptable in this world, and then I will follow them

316
0:24:10.540 --> 0:24:12.140
That's all it requires

317
0:24:12.140 --> 0:24:14.580
Sometimes rules don't make sense like I was watching

318
0:24:15.820 --> 0:24:22.500
Like a border security TV show there's lots of them depending on which country you want to watch and the border security UK one seems

319
0:24:22.500 --> 0:24:27.660
Very concerned with cigarettes right you can only bring a certain number of cigarettes back into the UK

320
0:24:27.980 --> 0:24:33.100
Before you have to pay duty on them, and I don't understand like that rule. I would respect that rule

321
0:24:33.100 --> 0:24:37.620
I don't smoke, so I have no reason to break that rule, but I would respect that rule without understanding it

322
0:24:37.620 --> 0:24:40.600
But I might ask what it's about, but I'd ask about it politely. I'm like

323
0:24:41.380 --> 0:24:46.500
Why I don't understand like I get the whole like don't bring guns in don't bring drugs in

324
0:24:46.500 --> 0:24:51.540
But I'm just like they didn't pay tax, but they brought it elsewhere like why are they paying tax when it crosses the border?

325
0:24:51.540 --> 0:24:52.980
I don't understand

326
0:24:52.980 --> 0:24:55.900
So I would go I would go look that up. I've been meaning to do that

327
0:24:55.900 --> 0:24:57.900
It's on my to-do list by just having that time

328
0:24:58.580 --> 0:25:03.020
Moving onwards because I'm now ranting about horse media for a long time for no reason um

329
0:25:04.300 --> 0:25:08.540
Repices there's now community a list of safe modes. I did read that you've got the

330
0:25:09.420 --> 0:25:15.060
Like compatibility checking the the hashing checking beautiful job again

331
0:25:15.060 --> 0:25:17.500
I'm not accusing the modding community of doing anything wrong

332
0:25:17.500 --> 0:25:22.540
I'm just saying like there is the ability for an unknown actor to

333
0:25:22.900 --> 0:25:28.780
Intercept that string value and it would use something similar to the the tools which the modding community use

334
0:25:29.020 --> 0:25:33.540
Moving on to questions and not talking about horse manure. I'm gonna regret that are they um

335
0:25:34.500 --> 0:25:41.060
Zenny welcome to the discord as you're new welcome to me as they wanted to ask since I'm rather new to Neos relating to cameras

336
0:25:41.060 --> 0:25:44.700
Is there a way to get a third-person camera if I were to stream as I could never figure that out?

337
0:25:44.700 --> 0:25:48.260
Yes, you need to use the streaming overlay

338
0:25:48.900 --> 0:25:54.260
Thingy, I know that doesn't make sense because issues what thingy with a new user give me a second here

339
0:25:54.260 --> 0:25:59.480
And I will get you the information that you need and properties faster. That's totally fine, too

340
0:26:00.060 --> 0:26:05.980
So there is a button on your home screen that is called camera streaming and opens up this very big confusing UI

341
0:26:05.980 --> 0:26:12.500
But I don't want you to worry about it. I will not type steaming into my tutorial searcher. I will

342
0:26:12.500 --> 0:26:17.260
Find the correct video that isn't steaming. It's streaming

343
0:26:18.100 --> 0:26:22.980
And then just give you some it's up to see froppy beat me and I'm just typing the word steamy and

344
0:26:23.460 --> 0:26:29.100
Into my video search so all I want you to do for the third person camera is to open the overlay which is that?

345
0:26:29.900 --> 0:26:33.020
Camera streaming button and then click two buttons on it

346
0:26:33.020 --> 0:26:37.020
I want you to click mirror to display which is the first button to click and then I want to click third person

347
0:26:37.060 --> 0:26:38.100
They're very big

348
0:26:38.100 --> 0:26:42.980
They're on that UI very clearly and then I want you to peek underneath your headset at your main monitor

349
0:26:43.060 --> 0:26:47.900
what the mirror to display will do is it will mirror the camera output to your actual display and

350
0:26:48.100 --> 0:26:52.100
then by clicking that third person button what you're saying is for the

351
0:26:53.260 --> 0:26:58.740
desktop window is in them the actual physical monitor display third person, but for the

352
0:26:59.740 --> 0:27:06.300
For the headset still display third person and that's actually what you see happening in that thumbnail as well, which is

353
0:27:06.300 --> 0:27:12.100
Hey, I am in first person inside that headset with my hand up to my face and

354
0:27:12.580 --> 0:27:18.500
I see first person but I'd mirror it display third person and I can see that if you are in desktop though

355
0:27:18.900 --> 0:27:26.640
F5 is like says I got it better about not wittering on sometimes. Well, anyway next question and we are over time now

356
0:27:26.640 --> 0:27:31.840
So as any if you have another question, please feel free to type it. Otherwise, no more questions. So as any it's the last question

357
0:27:31.840 --> 0:27:33.660
Thank you. Ah

358
0:27:33.660 --> 0:27:39.300
Rizzo says does the on saving node have an opportunity to affect the asset being saved or is it too late when the notice fight?

359
0:27:39.300 --> 0:27:42.460
Impact the asset being saved. That is a good question. I will take a look

360
0:27:47.220 --> 0:27:49.220
Okay, so there is an event flow

361
0:27:49.860 --> 0:27:51.860
Which is approximately?

362
0:27:52.860 --> 0:27:54.700
Let me take a look

363
0:27:54.700 --> 0:27:55.980
control

364
0:27:55.980 --> 0:28:01.620
Save control here. It is save control reference on before save start saving

365
0:28:01.620 --> 0:28:05.060
Okay, so there are two there are two events that happen

366
0:28:05.580 --> 0:28:11.260
On saving there is the on saving node, which is technically under the hood called

367
0:28:11.940 --> 0:28:18.180
On on before save start so you should be able to use the on saving node to affect the world

368
0:28:18.580 --> 0:28:26.940
Basically, the the plot the the thing goes I'll type this so user presses say we'll just use a press to save on saving fires

369
0:28:26.940 --> 0:28:34.460
Saved fires and then you know, the object is saved so like that

370
0:28:34.460 --> 0:28:38.460
There's the order of operations. So on saving should give you an opportunity to do something

371
0:28:38.500 --> 0:28:40.060
What is important there though?

372
0:28:40.060 --> 0:28:45.660
Is that you can't have any nodes which will delay execution till the next update because that might cause problems

373
0:28:45.660 --> 0:28:50.860
So avoid that the delay node the updates delay node and anything like that

374
0:28:51.380 --> 0:28:56.500
Because that will will have problems there. That is a whole topic for another tutorial though

375
0:28:56.500 --> 0:28:58.300
It's like yeah

376
0:28:58.300 --> 0:28:59.540
cool

377
0:28:59.540 --> 0:29:03.060
The update delay nodes and stuff like that very very complicated

378
0:29:03.860 --> 0:29:09.620
If in doubt a update delay of two usually fixes stuff that requires an update delay

379
0:29:10.700 --> 0:29:12.860
so zenny has an update which says

380
0:29:13.780 --> 0:29:16.900
I'm actually asking something related to my hardware. So I got a new headset

381
0:29:16.900 --> 0:29:19.500
I got a g2 omni on set from a buddy of mine

382
0:29:19.500 --> 0:29:23.460
I wanted to know because in the past you to have problems if able to use it foul off config

383
0:29:23.460 --> 0:29:28.740
I think you are I'm not entirely sure there are other people in the community that have a g2 omni

384
0:29:28.740 --> 0:29:33.780
Sep so please ask them questions and help just say like I have a g2 omni sept anyone got any updates or

385
0:29:34.340 --> 0:29:39.740
Information for me and they'll be happy to help you out is the omni sept the one that has eye tracking that we don't currently

386
0:29:39.740 --> 0:29:41.500
Support I think it is

387
0:29:41.500 --> 0:29:46.540
If it is then it is the headset that doesn't have eye tracking and it's for a very strange reason

388
0:29:48.140 --> 0:29:53.020
No, it doesn't have mouth tracking yes, that's the one so the omni sept has mouth tracking

389
0:29:53.020 --> 0:29:56.420
But it doesn't export the data in any way that makes sense for us

390
0:29:56.620 --> 0:30:00.540
What it will give you is basically a picture of the user's mouth, which is completely useless

391
0:30:00.540 --> 0:30:07.260
I mean it isn't useless for like people who want to develop custom mouth tracking algorithms

392
0:30:07.260 --> 0:30:12.060
But what we want is a similar SDK to the vive mouth tracker

393
0:30:12.100 --> 0:30:18.540
Which is it does all the logic for you and outputs a list of weights like is the mouth open and when I say weights

394
0:30:18.540 --> 0:30:24.000
I mean the mouth trickle output. I am 50% sure that the user's mouth is open and then we can act upon that

395
0:30:24.260 --> 0:30:30.780
Whereas the omni sept mouth tracker is like here's a picture of your users face like thanks. That's

396
0:30:31.380 --> 0:30:33.220
very useful

397
0:30:33.220 --> 0:30:36.860
We could put open c-face on that. It just sort of like it's a

398
0:30:37.900 --> 0:30:41.940
It's a foundational approach about Neos is like do we?

399
0:30:42.500 --> 0:30:48.180
Do we want to start doing that and the reason behind that is because like doing that is sometimes like quite

400
0:30:48.180 --> 0:30:52.660
Resource intensive and we are not experts in that we could of course get

401
0:30:53.300 --> 0:30:58.300
Amazing amazingly experts at that we could do a bunch of research. We could do a bunch of work. We could spend months

402
0:30:58.900 --> 0:31:05.640
Prototyping it we could even submit scientific papers or we could just like use existing things like open c-face and stuff like that

403
0:31:05.640 --> 0:31:08.380
But then we have to maintain that I don't know what g2s

404
0:31:09.140 --> 0:31:13.260
Goals are with the mouth tricking like if we knew that it might be better to sort of say like oh hey

405
0:31:13.260 --> 0:31:17.660
We actually need to stand in here, but it's a lot more work than adding another device

406
0:31:17.660 --> 0:31:23.020
Which already does that let's say prime comes out with a prime face tracker, and it outputs weights

407
0:31:23.060 --> 0:31:25.820
That would be like I don't know a couple of days work

408
0:31:26.740 --> 0:31:30.200
Outputting the mouth camera from the g2 omni sept through all that stuff

409
0:31:30.300 --> 0:31:33.700
That's more like a week to like half a month depending on how complicated it is

410
0:31:33.700 --> 0:31:37.660
I believe that's all the questions we have so I'm gonna go ahead and end things off here quick reminder

411
0:31:37.660 --> 0:31:41.380
Go ahead drop in the questions and help channel if you have any other questions direct message me directly

412
0:31:41.380 --> 0:31:48.180
Knock me about things call me Susan. Whatever you'd like to do totally fine by me. I will see you guys next week

413
0:31:48.180 --> 0:31:51.100
If you have anything else you want to add please feel free to do it

414
0:31:51.100 --> 0:32:11.860
But this will be the end of the office our segment. Goodbye
