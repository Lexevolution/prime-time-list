00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
 Alright, welcome to Primetime, it is 4pm so we're going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,800
 Before we get started I've got a link to share, which is something I put together

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,320
 it was yesterday. This is endeavoring to help out Git and the moderation team on

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,520
 Thursday, not Thursday, Sunday, yeah Sunday, I don't know why I said Thursday.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:27,760
 But I put this together as a wiki page for you all. There are notes on this page, but

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,520
 do reiterate them. That page is not part of the guidelines itself, it is generated from

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,280
 interpretations of the guidelines. I have checked it over with moderation and it seems to be okay,

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,400
 but it's still possible to have guideline breaching activity in any of the sessions

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,240
 featured in that table, but hopefully that will cut down on the amount of times in Sunday where

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,080
 we get "can I have adult content in this session?" So maybe that will help, so take a look at that

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,520
 link in the thread. I don't know why, but every single Sunday the moderation team get the same

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,920
 question over and over again, so maybe that would help. Anyway, moving forwards to actual questions,

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,280
 we have a question from Jackal, who says "I've been having a lot of trouble with objects' rotations

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,720
 when trying to parent objects to other objects by drag and dropping in the inspector. I know that

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,160
 this is most likely because the order of operations matters, but do you have any advice for practices

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,280
 on this?" And they've added background as well, which is great, to add background information to

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,440
 your questions, that sometimes helps. "I'm making a clock as per your tutorial, but messed up the

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,880
 logics and am having trouble with the hands, they keep rotating in weird ways when I try to put

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,880
 everything together. I'm sure I'll figure it out, but if it's best to assemble parts of an object

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,800
 in a particular order, that would be of real help to me." I kinda need more information about what

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:48,160
 you're seeing. Like, rotations are complicated, basically. Just generally, for general tips on

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,720
 that, is to avoid using Euler angles wherever you can. There is always a non-Euler angle way of

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,400
 doing things, and I am always surprised when people just won't learn the tiniest bit of maths to avoid

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,800
 the Euler angle problem. For those who aren't aware, if you use Euler angles too much, too

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,520
 much, too many, too much, when you're dealing with rotations, you'll end up in Gimblelock, and

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,400
 Gimblelock is just very confusing. We don't represent it well inside the inspector, and so

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,120
 you end up with basically not realizing that it's happened. If you ever see axes other than the one

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,520
 that you're editing in the inspector change, that's because we're avoiding Gimblelock by adjusting

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:36,240
 those. You can't represent the complete possible rotational set of rotations, if that's a phrase

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,000
 that makes sense, whatever, in Euler angles, it's impossible. Quaternarians, quaternians,

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,840
 however the heck you pronounce that, I still don't know, you are able to represent rotations in,

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,680
 and it's very simple. A particular note for that one is the axis angle mode, which I believe I do

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,080
 cover in the tutorial, which is why I was confused how you may be struggling, but I'll have to take

34
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,600
 a look at that in-game to see what's going on there. I'm not entirely certain. Something that

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,000
 also might help is the origins tutorial. I will go ahead and link that in the thread as well.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,920
 Rotations are origin-dependent, and sometimes origins can be problematic, particularly with

37
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,320
 random 3D models downloaded from Sketchfab where the developer of the model is like,

38
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,640
 "Yes, the origin is inside the moon!" Moving forwards to Luzanth's question,

39
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,840
 they are asking "Is there a way to change spawn points per player? I won't have myself spawn in

40
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,880
 my Cloud Homes bedroom, but I'll play a spawn at the doorway." You should be able to use value

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,560
 user override on those, I'm not certain though. I will go ahead and open up the codebase, that'll

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,760
 take a few minutes though, so we'll jump back to that one, but you should be able to value user

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,280
 override and turn off, like have the default value for the spawn point to be off. But I don't know if

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,080
 that's the case until I open up the codebase, so give me a second and I'll get that open. I just

45
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,720
 gotta click like 17 different buttons to get that sorted, because you know, life. Okay, there we go,

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,760
 that's opening. Jackal asks "How is your extended trek across the wasteland next door going?"

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,360
 That's kind of on pause, basically. I'm happy to move over there, what I need to do is wait

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,720
 for the renewal note for this place, and then we'll see what the price of that is for anyone

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,320
 who doesn't know what I'm going on about. I'm most likely moving locations very soon, so I'm

50
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,400
 moving like literally one building to the left, so that's going to be fun. That's sorted. Okay, next.

51
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,560
 Actually there's a note from them, "Thank you for the advice about dynamic variables." Yes,

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,880
 dynamic variables are the best. Dynamic variables are literally the best. Beagle says "Is there an

53
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,200
 easy way for people to pull members out of a hidden lair?" There have been some instances

54
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,160
 where people lurk in hidden lairs, kick them from your world or ban them from your world. Like, I

55
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,960
 hate to be blunt when it comes to that shit, but like I really just don't have time for it.

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,000
 If they want to hide in hidden lairs, they can go elsewhere and not be in my session.

57
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,960
 Depending on what methodology they're using to create such a system, they will have anti-pulling

58
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,640
 out systems, so you know, it's difficult. Of course, if it's not your world, you might be

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,960
 limited to what you can do, which Froppy is updating their response with, but if it's your

60
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,400
 world, just kick them. Just kick them. The only way that we can challenge behavior like that is by

61
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,880
 making clear that it is not okay, and that's just not okay. So, cool. Usually what happens

62
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,200
 with the hidden lair system is it's something of the equivalent of they are parented under a slot

63
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,480
 which is disabled for a select number of people in the world. I don't care the reason why you're

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,920
 in that. If you're in my world, as in if I'm the host, you're going to be visible, and you're not

65
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,440
 going to be in that. Additionally, you're not going to use one of the annoying systems which

66
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,080
 goes like, you know, it makes like a space-age blink noise and like, you know, purple sphere,

67
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,480
 as far as I remember, when you go in and out of it. If you're inside my session, you're in there

68
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,560
 to be in my session. If you want to hide from my session, you can go to another session. That's the

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,480
 easiest way to hide from my session. If that makes you not want to hang it in my session because I

70
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,320
 don't allow you to use your special hidden lair system, that's absolutely fine. Don't come.

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,160
 Really sorry to be blunt, but like, that's the way I see it. I don't have time for that behavior.

72
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,800
 If you think it's cool, I want you to think about what you're doing. I want you to think

73
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,040
 long and hard about why you are going to someone else's world to hide in it.

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,560
 Beagle has another question. Let me just make sure I've missed any before the video I posted.

75
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,600
 I have not. Okay. Beagle says, "For some reason in one of my buddy's worlds, when translating using

76
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,120
 the gizmo, and then there's a weird crust like you see on the Avatar collaboration appears,

77
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:56,960
 and it'll snap the translation to that." That is native snapping. So here is a, albeit long video,

78
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,640
 but here it is. That is native snapping that's occurring. There are a few ways to kind of make

79
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,880
 that happen less. Something I've noticed is that if you're playing around with gizmos near a picture,

80
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,520
 the picture will have a snapping component on it, which means that gizmos will snap into the

81
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,720
 picture. So go into the picture, you'll find, I think, snap plane for a picture, you can remove

82
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,080
 that component and then it won't snap to those pictures anymore. Various other things have that.

83
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
 Where can that hide in the world? In the same world at random we kick people to...

84
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,480
 That snapping issue shouldn't be causing people being kicked. There might be something that's

85
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,280
 sort of left in your world. I remember one of the trolliest things I ever did. Oh my god,

86
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,720
 I'm just arming you with stuff. One of the trolliest things I ever did was accidentally

87
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,960
 parent a snap grid component to the world origin somehow. Snap grid will set up a grid of points

88
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,280
 that will do that kind of lock thing that you're talking about. And I just put it accidentally in

89
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,240
 the middle of the world. It was like, cool, gizmos just don't work in this world. Sorry, my bad.

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,360
 That's pretty easy to fix. And hey, if anyone is listening and decides to take that and start

91
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,880
 doing it to other people's worlds, it would constitute this harassment and maybe reportable

92
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,960
 under the moderation guidelines and may cause account restrictions. But there you go.

93
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,040
 I've told you how to do it and also told you how to mitigate it, which is go look for that

94
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,960
 snap grid component. There is more information in that video above there. Mentalish says that yes,

95
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,200
 some people have built systems to fight anti-layer systems. Yes, there is anti-layer systems,

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,360
 then there's anti-anti-layer systems, and then there'll be anti-anti-anti-anti-layer systems,

97
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,800
 whereas the actual soul for that layer system is a behavioral one, which is why I'm telling you,

98
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,360
 just kick them. I can't see that player. They must be doing something malicious. Kicked.

99
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,280
 Thumbs up. Move on with your life. If they get angry about you, cool, ban them.

100
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,080
 It's just like, you know, I can ban people because I don't like their avatar. Like it,

101
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,560
 if it's my sessions, I don't need a reason to. I've also seen one person that was using like the

102
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,200
 equivalent of a hidden layer system creatively. And I accepted that one because they were doing

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:09,280
 like a bit as a character. But it was still annoying. So keep that in mind. You know,

104
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,560
 it was sort of like RP related, which is like totally fine. You can state a reason for kicking,

105
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,640
 but there's a problem in this community, which is basically like, if they break any rule or do any

106
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,480
 infraction, even if you tell them exactly what they're doing that's wrong, they're not going to

107
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,040
 listen to you and they're going to make you the problem. It is problematic and yeah, okay, you

108
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,840
 should give them a reason. But if they don't listen, proceed with just kicking them. Cody

109
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,520
 said, I assumed it was possible to manage people or objects that spawned in by having a spawn point.

110
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,000
 You can indeed have a spawn point, but the problem is even if you have a spawn point, which sets a

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,400
 parent, they can have logic or system on their avatar, which goes like, I know you want me to be

112
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,320
 parented to this very precise anti like this culling system, this management system, this

113
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,920
 world organizational system, but I don't care because I'm an inconsiderate person. I want to

114
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,680
 be parented to the world route or my hidden layer system and make a lot of noise. And then when I

115
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,760
 open up my context menu, I want it to do the entire corestral Halo soundtrack for no apparent reason

116
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,920
 in global audio at a hundred percent volume. So, you know, like I said, the only way to combat

117
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,760
 this stuff is to just stamp it out. For anyone who thinks I'm being unfair, just imagine going to a

118
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,480
 real world party, okay? And the party is hosted at Prime's house and I open the door to my front door

119
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,320
 and I say, welcome, welcome, come on into the party. You hand me a bottle of wine that you

120
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,840
 brought, maybe some nice cheese. And I'm like, please take off your shoes. And you go, okay. And

121
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,800
 you take off your shoes. That's exactly how it should be in someone else's session. You know,

122
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
 and then you don't go into someone else's party at the house. You don't come into my house, you know,

123
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,280
 and you're like, I'm going to hide in a hidden layer and sit in your sink. No, that's unacceptable.

124
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,240
 You're not going to sit in my sink. I'll happily get you a chair. I'll happily get you wine and

125
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
 booze or whatever you want to drink. I'll feed you. I'll entertain you, but you're not going to

126
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,800
 sit in my sink. You know, the party's over, everyone's left. And I go to bed and I hear like

127
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,200
 giggling from my cupboard. I open up and it's like, sorry, I was in the hidden layer system

128
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,920
 inside your cupboard. Get out of my cupboard and leave. It doesn't make any sense. If anyone is

129
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,240
 like, oh, it's their computer, right? I understand that it'd be different if we had like servers or

130
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,400
 if it's a headless or if it's not, you know, they're not being hosted, but for the majority

131
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,680
 of sessions that aren't headless right now, they are, you're literally on someone else's computer.

132
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,080
 Like the host's computer is controlling your access to that session. So be considerate, please.

133
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,680
 Moving forward to other questions. So I stopped ranting about that particular topic because I

134
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,760
 could rant for hours and people won't listen anyway. He'll still have that problem. Years

135
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,720
 to come, you know, it'd be like, you know, the year is 2050 and people are still in hidden layer

136
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,080
 systems. Why? We don't know. So we have a question here from Lex. She says, is there any way to make

137
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,480
 facets spawner desktop not parent to the overlay layer without mods? Not that I'm aware of.

138
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,640
 Make that font size just a little bit bigger from me and then you've got an amazing meme.

139
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,360
 There is, I say the font size a bit bigger so I can read it without zooming in, but otherwise

140
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
 amazing meme. So unfortunately I don't know the answer to your question next. I'd have to take

141
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,600
 a look. I remember that we don't, this is like a really annoying cop out and I understand that it's

142
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
 frustrating. We don't technically support facet editing in desktop mode. And I hate that I'm

143
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,680
 saying that, but like, you know, I guess you could like write some code into the facet, like a little

144
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,960
 bit of logics that's like detects if the user that spawned it is, um, is a desktop user and then do

145
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,680
 some re-parenting there. That might work. There we go. Beautiful. Beautiful. Speaking of like RP

146
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,200
 characters like that, I did have one person at one point that had like, I don't know, like an

147
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,360
 Iron Man style landing. Actually no more appropriate one would be if you know that film Hancock,

148
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,000
 it's got Will Smith in it. Um, at the start of the film Will Smith's basically like a drunk superhero

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,440
 and his landing is like, cool. I'm going to completely wreck the road and the pavement.

150
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,880
 There'll be a crater every time I land. That was their like character's system for landing. And it

151
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,800
 was like, I know that you're like a character and you're trying to have fun here, but if you could

152
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,080
 stop like completely destroying my pavement with like sound effects and particle systems when you

153
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,560
 land, that'd be amazing. Thank you. By the end of the film, he can land without destroying the

154
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,240
 pavement. So maybe you should watch that film again. Angry Pilot asks, "Any info on button

155
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:49,120
 delegate relay?" Um, you shouldn't really need to use that. There's probably ways you can do it,

156
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,920
 but that usually is covered by like button action trigger or something like that. Let me see why we

157
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:03,120
 have that component. Button delegate relay. Let's see if we use that anyway. We do. We do use that.

158
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:13,760
 Set up delicate action. Oh, it's used on the audio reverbs and component. We use it to make all the

159
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:22,640
 buttons appear for the presets on the reverb. Yeah, it looks like just that. Hold on, there's a

160
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,040
 couple of other uses. That's the one I wanted there. Symbols about reference. Yeah, that's

161
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,080
 literally the only place we use that. So in some cases, there are components which you can attach

162
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:42,560
 and can technically use, but they have no real use that makes sense. The better question always is to

163
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,240
 start with the problem, not the solution. So there are a bunch of components which are just like

164
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,080
 completely nonsensical. In Uncategorize, look for up down controller or something. That's a really

165
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,840
 funny one. Ask Syro the next time you see him for his up down platform that uses that silly component.

166
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,480
 I might have it too. I don't remember if I saved it. Okay. Jack asks, question for dynamic variables.

167
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,120
 If I'm setting a variable to reference the user who turned the object on and when they turn it off,

168
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,600
 I want to clear the variable. Am I doing it correctly by writing basic user node to the

169
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,680
 variable? It seems to work. The variable comes null. Yeah. Like a dynamic reference variable

170
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:32,640
 of type user with a value of null will be okay. Something you should keep in mind is that some

171
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,920
 nodes will take in a null user ref and do different behavior. Particularly fire on true

172
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:47,200
 and fire on change, I believe they do custom stuff if you pass in a null rather than empty. I think I

173
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,040
 have those documented on the wiki because I got tired of talking about fire on true, so I went

174
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,560
 through and was like step by step here's what happened. So I'll see if I can find that. Fire on

175
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:04,160
 true. Fire. And then someone asked me a question about... Yeah, just double check that. There's

176
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,760
 actually a bit of any null handling that I've written there. But it's fine. Sometimes what I'll

177
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,000
 do as well is I'll create a variable which is called like user set and that'll be a boolean.

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And then that's really easy to pick up. You can do like is user -- I'm doing this in text,

179
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,200
 but it won't make sense. Is user set question mark colon. And then you can use user or host user

180
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:39,200
 for the parts of that. Now, of course, you could do is null, not null, et cetera. But sometimes

181
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:46,320
 it's better to do that by a more declarative way. There is also the has value output of some of the

182
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,720
 dynamic variable nodes you can use there. A lot of the time, though, you can actually just get away

183
00:16:50,720 --> 00:17:00,640
 with something along the lines of like... Yeah, I'm literally typing that. World user question mark

184
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,600
 question mark host user is a lot of times what I use. Although sometimes I'll do like in the middle

185
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,320
 there, I'll put like nearest user head sometimes. Because then it's like if there's a user set on

186
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:18,800
 the object with dynamic variables or the closest user or the host user, and then it gets there.

187
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,960
 Right now someone had a question which I needed to look up in the code base. I will scroll up and

188
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,320
 find that now that the code base has opened up. Spawn points per player. Excellent.

189
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:40,720
 That ain't the spawn point component. Not the spawn point component. Spawn... Let's do simple...

190
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:48,640
 Yeah, okay. So the common spawn area, which is the one that usually creates the glowy ring,

191
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,760
 that will respect the enabled field and the slots active field. So you could use that and do a

192
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,000
 values override on that for those. Although I don't know if that would work with synchronization,

193
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,720
 because I don't know if the host spawns that. Try that. Let me know how that works out.

194
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,720
 The non-spawn area one, so the spawn point rather than the the circuity one,

195
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:22,400
 that doesn't pay attention to the enabled state, which is problematic. But maybe it does. Give me

196
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,200
 a moment. Where's the weight? Like there's a weight property on the spawn point, right?

197
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,920
 Where's that at? Simple spawn... Simple user spawn...

198
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:40,640
 I'm thinking of something else. I'm gonna just quickly hop to a video I recorded.

199
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,600
 There's another component. I gotta look for it.

200
00:18:51,120 --> 00:19:00,240
 Thank you. Okay, good. Whilst I'm looking this up, make sure you get other doobly-doos questions in.

201
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:13,840
 Now I remember. Thank you, Lex, for the help. The circular one, that is just an edit to the

202
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:22,000
 common spawn area component. With the spawn point generator, that's correct. Yep, thank you so much

203
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,840
 for that. That's exactly what I was looking for. Yeah, so common spawn area is the the common

204
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,800
 component between spawn point and spawn. The reason why it's confusing is because the the dev tip has

205
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,920
 got the create new menu. You go create new object, you can go spawn point or spawn area. Spawn area

206
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,320
 does the sort of glowy ring thing. Spawn point does a static point. So all of those will respond

207
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 to the enabled and the slot is active field. I do not know if they will allow for a values override,

208
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,520
 but that's how I would at least start doing it. A note there as well is that you can use other

209
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,720
 point generators in the common spawn area. So I know that you will usually see a circle,

210
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,000
 but you could also do like a sphere. I don't know why you would, but you could. You could also do a

211
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,800
 whatever point generators we have. Let me take a look. Find all references. A box, a circle,

212
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:20,720
 a sphere, a square, and yeah. Oh, Beagle has a new question and they say, can you possibly do an

213
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,840
 entire logic system without using logic nodes at all, complete with the inspector? Oh, you could.

214
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,880
 I would not suggest doing that. You'd basically be hooking up components by using ribbons that

215
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,520
 you'd manually created yourself. Jackal asks, is there a way to make a hemisphere using the

216
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,960
 procedural measures in the game or would you need a blender or some other modeling program to make it

217
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,640
 hemisphere? You'd need a blender to do it. If you want to do that quickly, and I know this is kind

218
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,200
 of like a long winded solve, but you only have to do it once. Go find sloppy mcloppy's ring of the

219
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,480
 neolander, inspect it and find the templates in there and you can pull out all the shapes that are

220
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,680
 in the ring of the neolander and use them isolated. They have good UVs and stuff like that. So I

221
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,600
 sometimes do that. I think I actually exported all the meshes that that uses into like one object and

222
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,680
 saved that to my inventory a while back. Player Cody asks, there was a mental workshop video of

223
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,440
 name tags I attempted to follow yesterday where everything was set up the way you want. I wanted

224
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,960
 logged out for the day, came back the next day, I found everything was back to default. Is your

225
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,800
 video more accurate? My video might be more accurate. I would have to watch that video to

226
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,360
 see what the problem is. Common problems when it comes to name tags is not adding the requisite

227
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,640
 components to the name tag so that it doesn't know that it exists and it won't be hooked up correctly.

228
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,360
 There's also people don't save it correctly, so sometimes they save it outside of the avatar root,

229
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,560
 it needs to be inside the avatar root to work. I've seen a couple of people who make a custom

230
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,480
 name tag in the user root and then save it, which does not work. And then various other things like

231
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,040
 that. If you have multiple name tags in your hierarchy as well, it might sort of interfere

232
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,080
 with each other, so make sure you've got one. My video has the way I recommend doing it,

233
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,040
 so do keep that in mind. I don't know if it's going to work. I watched the workshop one when

234
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,680
 they recorded it, but I haven't watched it in a while. The thing that I do that kind of like

235
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:24,160
 reduces the chances that you can make a problem is I drag the existing default name tag into the

236
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,920
 avatar root right at the start, and then I edit it from there. Other people will do setting up

237
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,920
 the name tag from scratch, but that means you have to add all of the components manually,

238
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,200
 whereas if you just steal an existing one and drag it into the avatar root,

239
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,160
 then you don't have that problem. Beagle says "Where the hell did you get all the meme material

240
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,000
 and stuff inside of your inventory? I browsed through it the other day and holy-" I presume

241
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,680
 you mean the meme folder inside my public folder? Okay, yeah. That one needs renaming. It's not like

242
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,440
 memes that you would see on 4chan, 9gag, or iFunny, stuff like that. It's not like regular

243
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:10,080
 memes. It's usually sort of chaotic distractableness that happens inside of Neos. Of particular note,

244
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,640
 there's a coat hanger there that's got dynamic bones on it. That used to be effortless equippable,

245
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,120
 but I think that went wrong, but you could just make it one. That happened because a few people

246
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,080
 that I was hanging out with were using deer avatars, and they had, you know, antlers,

247
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,480
 and I just thought it'd be funny if I could like hang a coat hanger on their antlers, so I got that

248
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:40,160
 happening. All sorts of stuff like that. There's a turtle in there, which has no instructions

249
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,240
 at all, so I'm amazed if anyone's figured it out, but there's a turtle you can spawn in there,

250
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,840
 and it's got a straw in its nose, and if you pull that straw out really fast, it plays the Beyblade

251
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,480
 opening, and that occurred because I was speaking to someone in the world, and they were talking

252
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,880
 about their use of straws, and I said "those better be, you know, metal or paper straws,

253
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,680
 right?" They said "no plastic." I said "you know they have to like pull those out of turtles?"

254
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,840
 And I did like a quick pulling motion, and someone went "like a Beyblade!" and then I made that.

255
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,840
 It's like, you know, like environmentalism via memes, that one is. There's also a cutlery box

256
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,320
 in there where you can grab and pull out cutlery. That was caused by a similar thing where someone

257
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,840
 was saying like "oh yeah I need more cutlery" and I said "what did you mean? What do you mean?"

258
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,440
 They used plastic cutlery, and I took offense to that, so I made that to kind of show the

259
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,760
 inanity of it. The one that I have a real big problem with is foil. So I know we're going over

260
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,320
 time but whatever. If you have a baking tray that is metal, and you put foil on it before you put

261
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,120
 whatever you want to cook in the oven, you're like not human, I don't understand. You're like "oh I

262
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,720
 put foil over my metal baking tray so I don't have to clean my baking tray" and it's like "cool,

263
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:06,000
 all right, so people have to mine in the ground for a limited resource which they then have to

264
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 like smelt and process an alloy because aluminum is difficult to process and then they have to

265
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 roll it incredibly thin onto reels just so you can avoid doing the dishes. What planet are you on?

266
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,240
 What planet are you on? Just do your dishes. Now I'll accept if you use if you use foil to like,

267
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,360
 for example, cover a chicken or cover a turkey when you're cooking it. That makes more sense.

268
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,360
 It's purely if you're using it to avoid cleaning. They dig that stuff out of the ground and it's a

269
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,760
 limited supply. We're not going to run out in your lifetime, I know that, but like just think about

270
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:51,040
 it. It's like because I can't be bothered to clean a baking tray, I have reduced the level of

271
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,560
 aluminum in the world by a little bit. All right, moving on to actual questions rather than my

272
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:03,200
 strange environmentalism. It's like really weird. It's like, you know, my computer's on all the time,

273
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,880
 but I won't use plastic. It's crazy. Anyway, Tiki says, "Is the way to limit the rotation of fingers

274
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,280
 in the hair manager in my avatar impales itself its own claws right now?" There is not. Currently,

275
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,680
 there is not. That is a common thing that we have. Cody has an update to their nameplate issues.

276
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,200
 "They spawned a previous avatar, hopped into that one, saved the configuration,

277
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
 world spawned and recently saved one, hopped into it and everything was fine. When I said

278
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,800
 it changes next to it in years, everything was fine. When I'm watching years ago,

279
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,160
 I found out the default was activated." Double check the components. That could also be

280
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,160
 synchronization and it could be this amazing thing in the inventory where occasionally the order

281
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,560
 of items in your inventory can just randomly change. And so you may think that you're in

282
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,240
 the most recent copy of your avatar, but you're actually in a copy from like three years ago,

283
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,720
 because that happened recently. I see lots of people talking about like foiling their

284
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,320
 baking trays. I'm too lazy to clean it. So you would rather like, you know, accompany

285
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:06,560
 mines in the ground to get small rocks, which they have to smelt and roll, just because you're lazy?

286
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,360
 Like, what planet are you on? You know, like hundreds of years, we're going to be like out

287
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,680
 traveling the stars, we're going to be like on Mars, other like solar systems and stuff like

288
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,400
 that. And they're going to run out of aluminum and they'll look and they'll be like, it's that guy,

289
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,640
 the person who didn't just do their dishes. You know, aliens are looking down on us and they're

290
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,360
 like, "shall we make contact with this like seemingly civilized society?" They've got

291
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,120
 problems, but should we make contact with them? Oh no, they put like foil on them.

292
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:46,080
 Rather than just cleaning them. Izit says that aluminum is recyclable. Yeah, did you know that

293
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,200
 lots of recycling is actually just a lie? And like, it just goes in landfill anyway. It's crazy.

294
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,160
 Here, I have a video for you. Actually, you can just like YouTube it, like recycling is a lie.

295
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,120
 And like, you'll see a lot. Yeah, it is plastic. Yeah. But the other thing with like metal

296
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,720
 recycling, you have to remember is it's foil. It's, it's, it's, it's going to get mixed up

297
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,680
 and it's going to not be recycled sometimes. It's the, it's, it's thin. You have to get all

298
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,960
 the grease off of it. So someone ends up cleaning it. Like someone, either like a very hot light

299
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,920
 reforging machine or whatever, but you know, it's not just like when, when someone says like,

300
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,080
 "oh, it's recyclable", but you have to put more energy into recycle it. We'll get back to Nia's

301
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:36,880
 questions rather than recycling. Anyway. This week, Prime talks about recycling. Actually,

302
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,040
 one more final bit about recycling. Clean your containers before you recycle them. I have a great

303
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,840
 memory of being at university once and you know, university housing, sort of like five other people

304
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,680
 and I was doing the recycling for them and I was sorting it out and it was like half a bottle of,

305
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,560
 of Coca-Cola is not recyclable. The bottle that it's in, sure that's recyclable, but you have to

306
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,240
 empty the, the cola out of the bottle before you recycle it. If you have cola in the bottle when

307
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,560
 you recycle it, they won't recycle it because it's dirty. You have to rinse it. The polystyrene,

308
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,240
 like burger boxes that you get from like a cheaper burger places, not recyclable. They're equally not

309
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,880
 recyclable when they have half a burger in them. Like a jar of mayonnaise made out of glass, very

310
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,040
 recyclable, but not when it's like one ape full of mayonnaise that's rotted and is moldy. Like,

311
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,920
 you know, you like rinse stuff. It got to the point where like, I just took like a big glass

312
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,280
 and I was just emptying everything that people were trying to recycle into this glass. And I

313
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,400
 got up to a pint of liquid and I said that liquid should have been in the drain for that to be

314
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,400
 recyclable. Oh, you should also remove the labels from things like you should remove the labels

315
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:52,080
 from glass jars, bottles, containers, jars, et cetera. You have to remove the labels as well.

316
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,880
 Cause the label is paper and needs to be recycled separately. I'm really, I'm going back to

317
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,240
 questions now. I promise, I promise. No more recycling. Beagle says, where can we find

318
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,680
 your MMC thing that you showed me in the wild? You already jammed out to the fart reverb.

319
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,400
 Yeah, that's better. That should be in the meme folder. I need to do a video on it,

320
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,080
 but it should be in the meme folder. Moving downwards. Peach Clover says, do you know

321
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,880
 what, if any, model import format preserves origins of the object? Let me, I think this

322
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,280
 is an unlisted video where I got angry at someone because they wouldn't, they wouldn't listen when

323
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:33,680
 I was talking about origins. Yes. I haven't found a single 3d model format that I can input or output

324
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,880
 and keep the translations for. It's really bugging me. I think I made an issue about it.

325
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,480
 Okay. Moving forwards. I'm double checking. I haven't missed any. Okay. Here we go.

326
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,520
 Okay. We got the import format. No, I'm not aware of, I want to fix that one. That one

327
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,160
 really annoys me. I did the finger one. There's no way that I know of with the fingers.

328
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,280
 Cody says, I was poking around with experiment with different forms of lighting in Neo Studio,

329
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,600
 the semi video series on lighting. Is that a good source of, so yeah, that's a probably a little bit

330
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,960
 old. I haven't really done much on it. I also haven't done much on sort of optimizing lighting.

331
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,560
 One of the things I will say about lighting is if you are doing an inside map, as in it is not

332
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,800
 outside, delete the main directional light in your world and light it purely with actual light

333
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,920
 sources. I see so many sort of like social worlds where they're like inside a building and they

334
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:34,640
 still have the sun and it just, it doesn't make any sense. Like if you're making that, say like a bar

335
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,880
 that's inside, there's no way to go outside. So there's no outside, there's no, you know,

336
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,800
 back door or anything like that. There's no front door or anything like that. It should not have a

337
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,960
 sun in it because the sun should not be lighting it. I mean, if there's windows, yeah, sure. But

338
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,640
 like it shouldn't, because there's no way to sort of restrict the sun's influence. It means that the

339
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,160
 sun will just like beam in on everything and ignore any sort of collision. And so it's like,

340
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,680
 ah, yeah, we want to make like a, you know, like a CD bar where maybe like, you know,

341
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,640
 you've got the tip to solve the murder mystery in your game world and you've got a sun in there.

342
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,400
 Beagle says, how does one prevent light from bleeding into floors above and below?

343
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,080
 You usually have to sort of surround the things with primitives. Like if it's,

344
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,960
 if it's custom meshes, it will usually leak more light. But if it's primitives,

345
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,560
 you can usually sort of block the light a bit better with primitives. That's what usually

346
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,120
 what I see happen. We do need better lighting tools, most notably, of course, light baking,

347
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,880
 but also some tweaks to things called light probes, stuff like that,

348
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,840
 which is on the graphics side of things that, that, that needs to happen at some point.

349
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,640
 Zalasar, I think that's how I pronounce that says, I've heard a good Linux experience is to make your

350
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,360
 own multi-tool tip. Where would I start if I wanted to do this? I don't have a tutorial on that

351
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,960
 because I don't like multi-tool tips. I don't want to go into another like four hour rant about

352
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,680
 recycling and stuff like that. So I will just leave it there. Like I don't like multi-tools.

353
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:06,240
 I don't suggest you make one. If you want to use a learning experience, try making a game where you

354
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:14,880
 are a broccoli trying to outrun a green cat that chases you through the swamp. And you'll learn a

355
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,400
 lot more than if you make a multi-tool. There may be tutorials out there, but I'm not aware of.

356
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,120
 If anyone has any, please refer to link them. Like when you come into Neos and new people are like,

357
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,760
 how do I learn Neos? It usually goes like, let's make a custom inspector. Let's make a custom

358
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,600
 multi-tool. And it's like, no, let's make something that touches other people. You know what

359
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,680
 I mean? Not literally, but touches other people with my creativity, let them show, show them your

360
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:48,000
 creativity and learn by doing that. And that usually isn't a multi-tool or a customer inspector.

361
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,160
 Like look at the MMC entries that we had this year that are in the sort of world social,

362
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:00,080
 world other, world game category, where they're trying to tell you a story. They're trying to

363
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,080
 tell you some art through their creation. Like the carwash, for example, that carwash map

364
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:14,320
 makes very little sense, but is fun. And people that worked on that probably learned a few things

365
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,080
 and there wasn't like, there was a lot of creativity in that world, but there wasn't a lot

366
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,800
 of technical complexity. Like everything was sort of, there was a pin pad for a door. I've got a

367
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,680
 tutorial on that one. There was like an interactive screen for the carwash. I don't have tutorials on

368
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,800
 that one, but it's quite, it's quite simple. I don't want to demean it by saying, you know,

369
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,000
 it's not worthy of the praise it's getting. It is. It's just like nothing in that world was very

370
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,560
 complicated. It was very, very well put together, but the technical aspects weren't very complicated,

371
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,160
 which isn't a bad thing. And that's what I mean, Beagle. I'm not saying the creativity was low,

372
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,640
 the creativity was incredibly high, but the technical skills needed to make that world were

373
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:59,200
 lower than say, making a multi-tool or making a custom inspector or making red print or making

374
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,720
 any of the other tools that people use. It was like a very good way of doing things.

375
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,960
 Beagle has one final question. We'll close off questions there cause we're at 1646. For some

376
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,360
 reason, my Eagle mounted beast of different and decent inspector size. For some reason,

377
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:21,760
 my Nardo's inspector is tiny and it resizes the dev two tip smaller. That's usually caused by the

378
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:34,000
 tool anchor scale. So try that one, try the tool anchor scale. Let me just head on over to the dev

379
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,920
 tip code as well. Yeah, we don't really have any scale logic in the create inspector thing.

380
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:47,520
 Make sure it's the tool anchor, not the like nothing underneath cause that all gets generated.

381
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,760
 I can have it like the next time, which I don't, I'm doing a bunch of stuff. And with that,

382
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,720
 okay, we'll answer one more final question from eyes and that, that, that last question,

383
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,400
 no more questions, even about recycling. Is there some convenient way to give things

384
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,640
 colliders that are the same precise shape as the object model? You need to watch,

385
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,400
 if you would like to, I don't want to like order around. You can take a look at

386
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,200
 optimizing colliders. Here you go. And we'll go ahead and leave off there. In the meantime,

387
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,120
 between now and next time, I want you to think about what you're throwing away

388
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,240
 and how you can reduce, reuse, and recycle it. See you next time.
