1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.220
So welcome to office hours we're gonna go ahead and get back on track and get over to the questions after talking about dishwashers

2
0:00:05.220 --> 0:00:06.640
and

3
0:00:06.640 --> 0:00:11.960
Pain products if you want to hear the pre office hours chat arrive five minutes early. I talk about random stuff

4
0:00:12.660 --> 0:00:15.620
So we're gonna go ahead go through questions. There are some questions in the chat

5
0:00:15.620 --> 0:00:19.420
I'm gonna go ahead and check the pre question sheet because I was linking that around to certain someone and

6
0:00:19.540 --> 0:00:23.500
They might have dropped some stuff on there and I didn't check it last week. So I need to go ahead and check it

7
0:00:23.500 --> 0:00:27.700
Oh, there is a question here, but it is not by that person. So we have a question on the sheet from

8
0:00:27.700 --> 0:00:32.740
Neils who says could the app Neos the universe be re-uploaded to the store

9
0:00:32.740 --> 0:00:34.400
I've not really done couple of guys report issues

10
0:00:34.400 --> 0:00:39.380
I believe they're referring to the earlier version of Neos universe that was put on the quest or by fruits

11
0:00:39.380 --> 0:00:41.520
I don't know the status of that or anything about that

12
0:00:42.220 --> 0:00:46.840
Suffice to say it won't probably be touched for the foreseeable future due to the ongoing

13
0:00:47.740 --> 0:00:48.860
stuffies

14
0:00:48.860 --> 0:00:50.300
Yay

15
0:00:50.300 --> 0:00:56.420
I'm gonna go ahead and mark that question as resolved and we'll get on with the questions that exist in the chat

16
0:00:56.420 --> 0:01:02.000
So it's growing up through the chat to look at questions egg roll faces. What is your favorite snacking cheese recommendations?

17
0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:05.140
There's 60 seconds or less. I don't answer questions about cheese. It's kind of a meme

18
0:01:06.020 --> 0:01:08.020
So we'll move on

19
0:01:08.160 --> 0:01:14.860
Pyronic says have you heard of git work trees? I've just recently discovered them seems useful for working on different features block branches

20
0:01:15.200 --> 0:01:20.840
Yes, I've used them extensively over the 10 12. I don't know I'm getting old a bit

21
0:01:21.360 --> 0:01:23.360
Years of my career I've used them extensively

22
0:01:23.360 --> 0:01:28.360
They are great when you use them. There are a lot of stuff that you don't need

23
0:01:28.760 --> 0:01:33.680
There's this amazing flow called git flow and everyone's like, oh, yes use git flow

24
0:01:33.680 --> 0:01:37.040
It is beautiful blah blah blah blah, and it's just really complicated

25
0:01:37.440 --> 0:01:43.960
The important thing to do though is to start a branch when you think that the master branch might get dirty

26
0:01:43.960 --> 0:01:46.000
And that includes when you're working with other people

27
0:01:46.000 --> 0:01:49.320
So if you've got multiple people working in your project always be on a branch, right?

28
0:01:49.320 --> 0:01:55.440
the master branch should be what everyone is pulling from and everyone else should be on their own branches and I don't care what they're

29
0:01:55.440 --> 0:02:01.820
Named just make sure that they name something a branch should only have commits associated with one individual feature on it

30
0:02:01.840 --> 0:02:05.320
Don't do I see some people do which is when they start work in an organization

31
0:02:05.320 --> 0:02:06.440
They make a git branch

32
0:02:06.440 --> 0:02:12.660
Which is just like their name and then they put all of their commits on there and periodically they'll do pull requests and like merge

33
0:02:12.660 --> 0:02:15.920
That back in that is so messy make a branch for each feature, please

34
0:02:15.920 --> 0:02:21.240
I realized I was calling it the old master branch name most git places

35
0:02:21.240 --> 0:02:27.320
I've now renamed the master branch to main apologies for that one. That's still affecting me because some older repositories

36
0:02:27.320 --> 0:02:29.320
I dealt with at work were

37
0:02:29.840 --> 0:02:33.040
Unable to be updated and so it's just like I have no idea

38
0:02:33.040 --> 0:02:38.240
But if you make a github repo these days by default the main branch will be called main rather than master

39
0:02:38.760 --> 0:02:42.440
Let's move on. Oh, if you want to know what we do at Neos as well, we do do branches

40
0:02:42.440 --> 0:02:49.080
I am whilst freaks was the only developer branches were uncommon, but I've been teaching freaks the way of branches

41
0:02:49.080 --> 0:02:54.900
I've also been teaching freaks the way of atomic commits atomic commits our way. Basically each commit that you make to a git

42
0:02:56.480 --> 0:03:00.760
Repository needs to be sort of as isolatable as possible an example of this might be

43
0:03:02.220 --> 0:03:06.480
Commit one for a feature is introducing a new file like a new file to the code base

44
0:03:06.720 --> 0:03:10.820
It just introduces the new file and some of the basic building blocks for that file

45
0:03:10.820 --> 0:03:17.600
It doesn't use that file anywhere. It just introduces that file and then the next commit might be adding that file to other stuff

46
0:03:17.600 --> 0:03:24.800
So it's actually integrated or stuff like that. It's it's depends on the exact patterns and development of the language of doing sometimes

47
0:03:24.800 --> 0:03:29.200
But it's good to just make it like easy for people to see what an individual commit does

48
0:03:29.200 --> 0:03:31.920
Oh and squash merge when you merge stuff on github

49
0:03:32.800 --> 0:03:37.520
Moving onwards away from high technical programming stuff because I know you're here for the Neos stuff

50
0:03:37.520 --> 0:03:42.200
We'll go on to the next question. Rusia says, can you describe how cache hit miss system works?

51
0:03:42.200 --> 0:03:47.280
What's the primary identify? Is it based on idea hash or random value? Don't actually know. I'll go ahead and

52
0:03:47.920 --> 0:03:53.480
Add that one to my list of questions. I just can't answer as parts of Neos. I just haven't looked at

53
0:03:54.080 --> 0:04:00.800
And that's one of the cases I did look at the the way that we did. So we've like really extensive code that deals with

54
0:04:02.080 --> 0:04:04.080
username clashes

55
0:04:04.080 --> 0:04:07.560
So it's common for you know, people who are just writing a system

56
0:04:07.560 --> 0:04:11.400
They're just like hey if this username equals this other username, you can't register it, right?

57
0:04:11.400 --> 0:04:17.280
You have the same name like no one can register. Fruxius is their username on Neos. We go a step further than that though and

58
0:04:17.800 --> 0:04:21.200
We will take a look at how Fruxius is represented in

59
0:04:21.840 --> 0:04:28.440
Other alphabets so we take a look at the Russian alphabet the various Japanese and Korean alphabets

60
0:04:28.440 --> 0:04:35.760
And Chinese as well just to make sure that like when we translate those names into different alphabetical systems

61
0:04:35.760 --> 0:04:40.080
There aren't any clashes as well. That's actually really cool. If you want to pronounce

62
0:04:40.760 --> 0:04:43.120
Like a Japanese phrase, I'm not good at Japanese

63
0:04:43.120 --> 0:04:45.080
So like, you know if I want to pronounce some of those phrases

64
0:04:45.080 --> 0:04:47.520
I can put it through that system and it tells me what their name is

65
0:04:47.520 --> 0:04:48.560
You know, it's really cool

66
0:04:48.560 --> 0:04:51.800
I was taking a look at that like I put in Japanese characters and I got out the

67
0:04:52.160 --> 0:04:57.440
romanization of that which was really cool wrote some tests for that the other day as well because I was messing with it and

68
0:04:57.440 --> 0:05:00.600
I had to put through like a bunch of stuff

69
0:05:00.600 --> 0:05:04.400
So I went to like a name database website and chucked a bunch of names in

70
0:05:04.720 --> 0:05:09.960
Okay, so next question for electronics, which is a great opportunity for me to like make a very clear point

71
0:05:10.320 --> 0:05:14.840
So electronic says to add to this. How does clearing the cache not mess badly with a database?

72
0:05:14.840 --> 0:05:18.160
So they're actually two folders. There's that data location and there's that cache location

73
0:05:18.200 --> 0:05:24.680
They're often confused or overlapped or referred to as the same thing and it causes problems both in support and dealing with those support

74
0:05:24.680 --> 0:05:30.200
It's just when people give like solutions to problems or instructions. Sometimes one will be deleted and not the other one

75
0:05:30.320 --> 0:05:33.760
so the the database is a collection of

76
0:05:34.680 --> 0:05:42.560
just like a big database the literal definition of the word of like everything that you've basically seen or saved in in this and

77
0:05:43.120 --> 0:05:46.720
It's then trying to keep in sync with the cloud database

78
0:05:47.640 --> 0:05:52.200
Today, I'm sorry. Um, and so syncing those across is very difficult

79
0:05:52.200 --> 0:05:56.160
That's why sometimes you get cache conflicts or corrupt caches and stuff like that

80
0:05:56.160 --> 0:06:03.200
I have only once had a corrupt cache and only once had a syncing issue and both occurred during the VR chat boom

81
0:06:05.080 --> 0:06:10.640
But I don't know everyone else seems to have those difficulties all the time and I don't I do apologize for them

82
0:06:10.640 --> 0:06:12.720
I want to see what we can do to improve those when we're able to

83
0:06:13.320 --> 0:06:16.520
Now the cache though is just like randomly downloaded stuff

84
0:06:16.520 --> 0:06:22.520
And if you delete that it's not as bad because you're not messing with the database you're messing with cache

85
0:06:23.400 --> 0:06:30.400
You know how else to answer that question what I wanted to do though is say hey, please stop deleting them when you know

86
0:06:31.040 --> 0:06:35.240
Encountering a problem in computing and many other places actually you have three choices

87
0:06:35.240 --> 0:06:36.440
You can fix the problem

88
0:06:36.440 --> 0:06:41.300
You can ignore the problem or you can remove the problem in which in computers is usually delete

89
0:06:41.400 --> 0:06:45.600
So when you restart a computer, for example when everyone's like, oh you tried restarting a computer

90
0:06:45.600 --> 0:06:47.160
All that does is delete the problem

91
0:06:47.160 --> 0:06:51.800
It will just you know flush all the guts of the computer flush everything out of the memory

92
0:06:52.080 --> 0:06:54.980
Close any applications and restart them. So it just deletes the problem

93
0:06:55.000 --> 0:07:01.160
So if a problem occurs after restarting it often support desk agents will be like could you try restarting again?

94
0:07:01.160 --> 0:07:06.400
And I'm like, no, like that's not gonna do anything then they'll move on to could you try reinstalling it?

95
0:07:06.400 --> 0:07:11.040
Which again is just deleting the problem that flushes the guts of the computer with all the files that were involved in that particular

96
0:07:11.040 --> 0:07:17.620
Application and reinstalls it I would always rather that you do ignoring the problem or fixing the problem rather than deleting the problem

97
0:07:18.160 --> 0:07:19.200
Ignoring it's totally fine

98
0:07:19.200 --> 0:07:23.480
Like for example, my windows lock screen has had the same photo on it for like six years

99
0:07:23.480 --> 0:07:26.480
And I hate that photo because it's the first thing I see every morning, right?

100
0:07:26.480 --> 0:07:29.340
I haven't had coffee yet and I see that lock screen photo

101
0:07:29.340 --> 0:07:31.880
I want to change it, but I can't remember how because I

102
0:07:32.440 --> 0:07:39.900
Prevented windows from doing its thing where it's like here's the photo of the day. It's from a quaint beach in Hawaii, and it's beautiful

103
0:07:39.900 --> 0:07:42.280
I didn't want to see that stuff. I'm just like stop doing that

104
0:07:42.280 --> 0:07:47.380
But I didn't realize that would lock it down to one photo that's been there for six years, but I'll fix it when I can

105
0:07:48.000 --> 0:07:54.640
So please follow all the troubleshooting steps through in order and if Nia's team member then tells you to delete or clear your cache or

106
0:07:54.640 --> 0:07:56.640
Mentor does or whatever etc. That's fantastic

107
0:07:57.000 --> 0:08:02.720
Then make sure you do the previous steps first because you'll actually learn something you'll learn something when you fix programs you you learn something

108
0:08:03.200 --> 0:08:07.200
I had an issue with I remember something to do like a plug-in

109
0:08:07.200 --> 0:08:10.080
in OBS and I

110
0:08:10.600 --> 0:08:14.840
Fixed that by actually making a fork of that plug-in releasing on my github because I'm like hey

111
0:08:14.840 --> 0:08:19.960
I learned a lot doing that moving forwards. Oh, I don't mean to shut you down egg refers

112
0:08:19.960 --> 0:08:25.440
It's just like we're meant to be talking about Neos and then the meme started of like yeah cheese is my thing

113
0:08:25.440 --> 0:08:27.440
But I didn't talk about it. And so now it's just

114
0:08:29.040 --> 0:08:34.000
So Tiki says I've been I've said I've seen many export formats for avatars

115
0:08:34.000 --> 0:08:37.640
But I don't know much about them as the one that could be useful to be able to import my avatar back into other

116
0:08:37.640 --> 0:08:39.560
games no

117
0:08:39.560 --> 0:08:41.560
avatars that are important to Neos are

118
0:08:42.040 --> 0:08:48.440
For lack of a better word garbled from an outside of Neos perspective. That isn't something that will be permanent

119
0:08:48.440 --> 0:08:52.800
Maybe there'll be a way to do it in the future. But right now it is not it's actually a strange

120
0:08:53.440 --> 0:08:56.500
Security feature as well. It's like an unintentional security feature, right?

121
0:08:56.500 --> 0:09:01.960
You can't export the avatar to other platforms without losing rigging information

122
0:09:01.960 --> 0:09:05.820
So you lose bone data, and I believe you use what lose weight painting as well

123
0:09:05.820 --> 0:09:10.960
So if you export it back out, you'll just get like a static mesh, which then you'd have to rereg so that that's cool

124
0:09:12.240 --> 0:09:18.880
That might change in the future. I am struggling here. Where's my water? Okay, I should be less vocal when it comes to dying now

125
0:09:20.400 --> 0:09:23.060
Yeah, that may change in the future. We'll see

126
0:09:24.560 --> 0:09:27.400
Interoperability is of course the big buzzword when it comes to your metaverses

127
0:09:27.400 --> 0:09:31.840
I'm moving forwards to Alex from Alaska. I'm gonna upload some photos. I did share these in

128
0:09:32.680 --> 0:09:38.000
Mentor Discs yesterday because it was topical and front-of-mind. I am working with

129
0:09:39.080 --> 0:09:40.920
SHFR, that's

130
0:09:40.920 --> 0:09:44.000
user name of SHFR, but their actual name is Hamish and

131
0:09:44.760 --> 0:09:52.260
We do science together and our science resolves around whatever the hell you can think of that is not video game related

132
0:09:52.260 --> 0:09:57.940
So this was my view of a Neos world yesterday, and if you can guess what I was doing

133
0:09:59.460 --> 0:10:04.780
Fantastic. If you don't know what I was doing, you'll have to wait until the end of this officer as well

134
0:10:04.780 --> 0:10:08.500
I'll tell you. There we go. I'll give you some time to play some games. See if you can figure it out

135
0:10:09.220 --> 0:10:10.900
Zlinka and

136
0:10:10.900 --> 0:10:12.900
DMX and Earthmark and

137
0:10:13.500 --> 0:10:18.620
A few others you're excluded from that because you know you were there

138
0:10:18.620 --> 0:10:22.940
So I'll leave that at the bottom of the scroll buffer and come back to once I've got through the rest of the question

139
0:10:23.260 --> 0:10:28.420
Mystic says how is documentation regarding the recent events been going? I've seen some really useful videos from both the team and users

140
0:10:28.420 --> 0:10:31.980
But other than pre-planned videos are there videos you think would be

141
0:10:33.420 --> 0:10:35.420
Otherwise be worth users making

142
0:10:35.980 --> 0:10:41.040
This is like two questions there, so like documentation regarding the recent events is difficult

143
0:10:41.060 --> 0:10:43.860
We don't want to put out any more information that is

144
0:10:43.860 --> 0:10:50.700
Like really big like those announcements because like really nothing has changed right see the announcements channel for any updates there as for the second

145
0:10:50.700 --> 0:10:52.460
part of that question

146
0:10:52.460 --> 0:10:55.460
Make content like I've been really happy to see

147
0:10:55.780 --> 0:10:59.420
Speckin's videos where he's just like there's a there's a gap. I'll make a video about this

148
0:10:59.420 --> 0:11:03.420
I've been really happy to see basement, but nerds videos where it's like hey, there's a gap here

149
0:11:03.420 --> 0:11:06.760
There isn't an introduction to logic so I make that and I was really really happy to see

150
0:11:06.760 --> 0:11:14.360
Engie's video where it's like here is a tutorial bracelet which many people wouldn't have a like aware of apparently Alex made

151
0:11:14.440 --> 0:11:19.600
Which means you can watch all the videos inside Neos and what's great is you can watch videos from all those creators because you can

152
0:11:19.600 --> 0:11:21.600
Just add playlists the system

153
0:11:22.160 --> 0:11:27.600
So just make videos if you don't understand something and then do understand it make a video about it

154
0:11:27.600 --> 0:11:32.440
That's how all my like earlier tutorials are made like I learned how the object grid aligner worked

155
0:11:32.440 --> 0:11:35.440
So I made a video on it. I learned how the axis aligner works. I made a video on it

156
0:11:35.440 --> 0:11:40.520
Fruks taught me dynamic impulses. So I made a video about it moving forwards

157
0:11:41.520 --> 0:11:43.520
Dicky's talking about get the

158
0:11:43.880 --> 0:11:48.680
Version control library not Canadian kit is there's lots of names and stuff that exist

159
0:11:48.680 --> 0:11:54.440
there's like Neos moderators short form mods and then there's Neos mods, which are the

160
0:11:54.960 --> 0:12:00.040
Modifications to the Neos that we allow which VRChat doesn't allow so they're being talked about a lot on the words

161
0:12:00.040 --> 0:12:05.960
Just get sort of like ah, so I've been trying to use the term moderator a little bit more to make things clearer or like

162
0:12:06.360 --> 0:12:09.980
Enunciating mods a little bit differently to make it clear, but hey, maybe it's not clear still

163
0:12:10.240 --> 0:12:13.280
It is cool. If you are looking to do computer programming

164
0:12:13.800 --> 0:12:17.440
You'll eventually need a version control system and get is the way to go

165
0:12:17.440 --> 0:12:19.160
There are others that are used for different cases

166
0:12:19.160 --> 0:12:21.840
For example, if you're using an unreal game usually you use perforce

167
0:12:21.840 --> 0:12:30.120
But hey, if you're just writing code gets cool learning it and yet Canadian gets also a chill dude moving forward to an idea's a question or

168
0:12:30.440 --> 0:12:34.320
An idea, I'm sorry pronunciation is not my forte. Hopefully this makes sense

169
0:12:34.320 --> 0:12:38.200
So assets on your avatar stored in the asset roots of the world

170
0:12:38.200 --> 0:12:42.920
Wouldn't that mean anyone who can edit the world could copy your avatars parts and reassemble them from assets in the directory

171
0:12:42.920 --> 0:12:48.120
Even if it's protected avatar. Yes, and no there are protections that exist on those assets

172
0:12:48.120 --> 0:12:54.680
Additionally, there is no white painting or armature data up there in the asset system. Do you remember as well that the

173
0:12:55.760 --> 0:13:01.040
Simple avatar protection system that we have is simple and that's why it's named simple avatar protection. It's quite

174
0:13:01.800 --> 0:13:06.600
Diligently named that way it is not watertight and there are ways to break it

175
0:13:06.600 --> 0:13:10.200
But it will remind you that there are ways to break any protection system

176
0:13:10.200 --> 0:13:14.280
We do want our protection system to get better and to get more

177
0:13:14.280 --> 0:13:17.680
Stronger it gets drunk

178
0:13:18.400 --> 0:13:25.040
The features that would enable that are combined sort of the license ID system and the hard permission system

179
0:13:25.960 --> 0:13:29.920
Yeah, that's a good enough answer. If you have any other things, please do that. Yeah

180
0:13:31.480 --> 0:13:33.040
Zari says

181
0:13:33.040 --> 0:13:39.480
Mandatory to allow different aspects it is it's really strange how there are a lot of software programs that don't do what they need to

182
0:13:39.480 --> 0:13:43.640
Do a good example of one another example being right to left support

183
0:13:43.640 --> 0:13:49.160
So there are a bunch of languages more than you know, I mean there are obvious ones like I think Hebrew does it

184
0:13:49.160 --> 0:13:54.060
I'm sorry if that's wrong Arabic most certainly does because that's the one that always tripped us up at mixer

185
0:13:54.560 --> 0:14:01.480
That read right to left and so suddenly your entire UI needs to be mirrored and work right to left

186
0:14:01.600 --> 0:14:06.580
But there are lots of like UI elements that are designed for a left to right world

187
0:14:06.920 --> 0:14:11.960
If you think about that just a simple like a dialog box appears and it has the OK cancel buttons

188
0:14:11.960 --> 0:14:18.160
With okay, usually on the left and cancel usually on the right. Does that make sense to right to left world? Don't know

189
0:14:18.320 --> 0:14:22.980
It's very calm challenging. So yeah, there's lots of stuff people just don't do they don't think about it

190
0:14:23.480 --> 0:14:27.120
When we needed to support right to left languages at mixer

191
0:14:27.160 --> 0:14:33.180
We just got the localization package back which is in all the strings translated into Arabic

192
0:14:33.180 --> 0:14:38.080
I think it was loaded them into mixer ran the page and then just went shit

193
0:14:38.080 --> 0:14:44.120
Just like things were overflowing everywhere UI were like backwards and forwards and upside down

194
0:14:44.120 --> 0:14:45.160
It didn't make any sense

195
0:14:45.160 --> 0:14:50.280
and it's just like this is a big project and it was we had like two or three engineers working on it for ages and

196
0:14:50.280 --> 0:14:56.000
They had to go back to design frequently and go what should things look like when this is in a right to left world

197
0:14:56.000 --> 0:14:59.640
I'm trying to say as well as you mentioned the database has everything that you have since was one

198
0:14:59.640 --> 0:15:02.920
We're wondering how it deals presumably looking at files that longer exists if they no longer exist

199
0:15:02.920 --> 0:15:06.040
There's usually a record of where to get them from so redownload them

200
0:15:06.040 --> 0:15:10.720
I do need to look into that more particularly seeing these freaks change that up a little bit and wants to change up more

201
0:15:10.840 --> 0:15:16.920
There are thousands of codes files in this code base. And sometimes I'm just like, I don't know what that file does

202
0:15:17.360 --> 0:15:21.840
Scrolling down people saying please don't die. That's great. Oh, we got to the we got to the pictures. Excellent

203
0:15:22.040 --> 0:15:25.560
Let's see if someone got it right. We see you got it right titanium bone plates. Yes

204
0:15:26.200 --> 0:15:28.600
So we've Hamish I am working on

205
0:15:29.920 --> 0:15:32.880
really complicated stuff actually, so if you have a

206
0:15:32.880 --> 0:15:35.960
a jaw injury or a jaw

207
0:15:36.840 --> 0:15:39.840
Disease such as like bone cancer or something in the jaw

208
0:15:40.360 --> 0:15:47.360
They can actually rebuild your jaw using the smaller leg bone that you have the fibula. I think that's the right bone name

209
0:15:47.360 --> 0:15:52.080
I always forget because there's two the the smaller leg bone kind of isn't needed and so

210
0:15:53.080 --> 0:15:55.040
You can survive without it in some cases

211
0:15:55.040 --> 0:15:57.560
Of course, you're not going to be like a prime athlete or something

212
0:15:57.560 --> 0:16:02.760
But like being able to chew and speak is generally better than then, you know being an athlete

213
0:16:02.760 --> 0:16:07.760
so what they do is they remove that entire bone they take out that entire bone and

214
0:16:08.240 --> 0:16:13.480
Then they chop the parts of it off and then they format it back onto your jaw in

215
0:16:14.440 --> 0:16:16.440
segments and then they use a plate to

216
0:16:16.760 --> 0:16:22.720
Align that to the jaw and screw it together such that it holds there and then eventually the bones will fuse together, etc

217
0:16:22.720 --> 0:16:24.720
But the plate there is to hold it together

218
0:16:24.880 --> 0:16:28.720
And currently the most common use of the plate is a standard plate

219
0:16:28.720 --> 0:16:35.440
It looks like a bike chain is standard for all surgeries and they just bash around a bit like sort of a blacksmith to try

220
0:16:35.440 --> 0:16:41.480
And get it to fit the shape of your jaw a new approach though is to make a custom titanium plate for your jaw

221
0:16:42.240 --> 0:16:44.160
which is

222
0:16:44.160 --> 0:16:45.560
molded and modeled

223
0:16:45.560 --> 0:16:52.540
Customly usually in a very painstaking process and we're trying to make that process easier and Neos is allowing us to sort of explore doing

224
0:16:52.540 --> 0:16:59.920
that so the pictures above are a plate creator tool I have which allows you to segment a plate onto

225
0:17:00.320 --> 0:17:05.920
any model using a sphere for testing just because sphere has lots of angles and I needed to test angles and

226
0:17:06.580 --> 0:17:08.580
Then you can bake that model

227
0:17:09.040 --> 0:17:11.040
send that out to

228
0:17:11.040 --> 0:17:17.520
the desktop application where it needs to go through processing to make it actually printable and then you send it to a metal 3d printer and

229
0:17:17.520 --> 0:17:21.000
Then you print it and then you affix it to someone's jaw or at least that's the plan

230
0:17:21.000 --> 0:17:27.520
that will enable better surgeries with less screws because the the regular plates have screw holes like every like

231
0:17:27.760 --> 0:17:29.520
Centimeter and it's really annoying

232
0:17:29.520 --> 0:17:35.400
But yeah, it's really cool. I don't see any additional questions. I will run down the rest of the comments that we've got here

233
0:17:36.240 --> 0:17:39.240
Let's see. Glad to see that you thought that

234
0:17:39.920 --> 0:17:46.480
Basement and NG's videos were a surprise. Mr. Carr liked them too. Sometimes mods mods have mods. Yep

235
0:17:46.480 --> 0:17:48.840
They sure do. Sorry said that they

236
0:17:48.840 --> 0:17:50.200
They

237
0:17:50.200 --> 0:17:56.680
They might have or you know have had in the past side of job and see that people use subversion subversion also known as SVN

238
0:17:56.680 --> 0:17:58.360
That's another good

239
0:17:58.360 --> 0:18:00.360
Version control system. It's okay. I

240
0:18:01.160 --> 0:18:04.120
Prefer like it's just winning basically, but like SVN is okay

241
0:18:04.760 --> 0:18:11.160
CVS not the pharmacy but central version control system terrible. Don't use that one. There's another one called like material or something

242
0:18:11.160 --> 0:18:12.720
I haven't used that one though

243
0:18:12.720 --> 0:18:16.360
They all have a point with like it and stuff like that is that you can do code reviews remotely

244
0:18:16.360 --> 0:18:23.400
I used to work for five months a software company where they did only in-person reviews. It was horrible

245
0:18:23.400 --> 0:18:27.160
I'm not that big on personal space invading

246
0:18:27.160 --> 0:18:31.640
I'm not sure anyone is these days but like obviously like other it affects more people than most I hate it

247
0:18:32.040 --> 0:18:34.700
And the way that code reviews worked at that company

248
0:18:34.700 --> 0:18:40.640
I worked at for five months was before you could commit the code to a branch your own branch. No idea why

249
0:18:40.640 --> 0:18:46.320
Um, someone would have to come to your desk and review it side-by-side with you hated that

250
0:18:46.320 --> 0:18:51.440
I'm like, can we please do code reviews in other way? I'll email the diff files to someone

251
0:18:51.440 --> 0:18:54.940
I don't care like please don't come to my desk. Leave me alone. It's horrible

252
0:18:55.400 --> 0:19:01.260
Anyway, moving forwards. Yeah that runtime says you got to ask that when you're interviewing. Yes

253
0:19:01.640 --> 0:19:04.160
Do you remember that when your job interviewing if you need to job interviews?

254
0:19:04.160 --> 0:19:07.100
I have so much insight about how to do them properly and stuff like that

255
0:19:07.100 --> 0:19:09.100
I will give you some hints and here's one hint

256
0:19:09.100 --> 0:19:13.080
um, you are interviewing the interviewer as much as they are

257
0:19:13.960 --> 0:19:21.960
interviewing you and your questions that you ask them are as good if not better sometimes than the questions that they are asking you for

258
0:19:22.200 --> 0:19:24.300
Understanding you and seeing if you're a fit at the company

259
0:19:25.120 --> 0:19:29.480
So if you want to like make them sweat a little bit, which is good, right? Because you're sweating you're nervous

260
0:19:29.480 --> 0:19:31.400
It's a job interview make them nervous

261
0:19:31.400 --> 0:19:38.740
Ask them what the work-life balance is like ask them what their day-to-day looks like ask them about the last time

262
0:19:38.740 --> 0:19:40.080
there was a

263
0:19:40.080 --> 0:19:44.520
Stressful situation at work and how the company mitigated that which is very important

264
0:19:44.520 --> 0:19:49.080
If your company that you're working for isn't mitigating stressful situations, then they don't deserve to employ you

265
0:19:50.400 --> 0:19:54.520
Every company should take action to reduce stressful situations not increase them

266
0:19:55.040 --> 0:19:59.960
So it's just a couple of questions there. They're interesting and then yeah asked about their tech stack, right? It's interesting

267
0:19:59.960 --> 0:20:03.380
I wish I'd done that before I joined the workplace. I work for for five months. Anyway

268
0:20:03.380 --> 0:20:08.140
I'm moving on. I don't see any other questions. So if you have any questions, do you let me know?

269
0:20:08.540 --> 0:20:12.380
We have about eight minutes left kind of short office hours today

270
0:20:12.540 --> 0:20:16.460
I just saw a quote channel ping from Lex which has make them nervous

271
0:20:16.460 --> 0:20:20.640
I'm on it like do it right if they're nervous then you've done the right job

272
0:20:21.260 --> 0:20:27.100
Another thing to look out for as well, particularly if you're in like my industry for interviews is often they'll give you a take-home assignment

273
0:20:27.100 --> 0:20:33.140
And watch those take-home assignments. Sometimes they are manipulative or sometimes predatory. So do keep an eye on that

274
0:20:33.900 --> 0:20:40.140
for example once when I was interviewing I was given a take-home assignment to make a redis parser redis is a

275
0:20:41.300 --> 0:20:44.260
Hard to explain thing. I don't really know how to explain this

276
0:20:44.260 --> 0:20:47.460
I know I would use it for I'm very familiar of how I would use it

277
0:20:47.460 --> 0:20:49.020
I just don't know how to classify redis

278
0:20:49.020 --> 0:20:55.420
It's like a sort of in memory database thing either a lot of software companies use for very good reasons

279
0:20:55.420 --> 0:20:58.820
But I don't know the sort of like tagline they would have on it

280
0:20:58.820 --> 0:21:00.620
I just don't want to use it for anyway

281
0:21:00.620 --> 0:21:06.220
they wanted to me to make a redis client which could speak the the language and the protocols that redis did and

282
0:21:06.820 --> 0:21:11.340
Just see how far I got and I got like my my spidey senses went off and I'm like, that's a bit weird

283
0:21:11.340 --> 0:21:16.260
Maybe they need maybe they need a redis client and they're hoping that I'll write one for them

284
0:21:16.360 --> 0:21:22.840
So I submitted the code assignment back to them, but I had licensed the code assignment that they gave me as GPL

285
0:21:22.840 --> 0:21:29.300
So I was like I've done your license your code assignment, but I've licensed to sit as GPL. So good luck

286
0:21:30.680 --> 0:21:33.080
for those unaware the GPL license for

287
0:21:34.000 --> 0:21:39.800
Code basically means that a company cannot use it for profit that easily

288
0:21:40.280 --> 0:21:46.800
It's what I was basically doing is like this seems fishy. So I'm gonna license it as GPL and I'm like, okay

289
0:21:46.800 --> 0:21:51.400
I won and I'll actually do that now for like all coding assignments. I license them as GPL

290
0:21:51.400 --> 0:21:55.520
Additionally for coding assignments or take home assignments and job interviews make sure it's not too

291
0:21:56.600 --> 0:21:58.240
Aligned to the job that you were doing

292
0:21:58.240 --> 0:22:05.120
I had an interview another place where the take-home assignment was basically what I'd be doing at the job and I said that's unfair

293
0:22:05.120 --> 0:22:07.560
That's consulting because it's too close to the job

294
0:22:07.560 --> 0:22:12.280
I was interviewing for a product manager position and they were asking me for sort of like ideas and

295
0:22:12.320 --> 0:22:19.060
Insights on the product that they were building and they weren't paying me for that and I'm like that's not appropriate as a product manager

296
0:22:19.060 --> 0:22:21.800
You can give me a take-home assignment about an arbitrary problem

297
0:22:21.960 --> 0:22:23.560
for example a

298
0:22:23.560 --> 0:22:30.640
Airplane booking system if your company is doing I don't know t-shirts and you ask me for an airplane booking system product manager take-home assignment

299
0:22:30.640 --> 0:22:37.780
That's fine. But if you're a t-shirt company and you ask me for a product manager at take-home assignment about t-shirts, that's bad

300
0:22:37.780 --> 0:22:41.560
I'm giving you free advice. You will pay me for that or I will not do it

301
0:22:41.560 --> 0:22:45.720
And I've actually said no to a couple of jobs because of that and change the hiring policies. It's great

302
0:22:45.720 --> 0:22:50.040
I say no and then the hiring manager is like but we really liked you

303
0:22:50.080 --> 0:22:57.440
We'll change our hiring policies for you. And I'm like, no, sorry on principle. Like I can't wait you're asking for consultancy at that point

304
0:22:58.160 --> 0:23:01.840
Okay, they're actually asked some other Neos questions. So for those who are not

305
0:23:02.680 --> 0:23:07.960
In the software engineering land, I will go back to Neos questions. I apologize for that, but some people enjoyed it. So great

306
0:23:09.360 --> 0:23:13.380
Sorry says that they had to print out our code and explain it at the meeting table

307
0:23:13.380 --> 0:23:18.660
Yeah, don't don't print code either but most teaching best practices is good

308
0:23:18.660 --> 0:23:20.900
But you should take that knowledge and crystallize it into a PowerPoint

309
0:23:21.420 --> 0:23:25.900
And then you can do that a lot easier or ideally not a PowerPoint maybe like a blog article people

310
0:23:26.260 --> 0:23:32.540
misunderstand that like internal documentation part of things like you should have an internal documentation that is as good as

311
0:23:32.820 --> 0:23:36.220
external documentation for your software like if someone is new to the

312
0:23:36.980 --> 0:23:42.420
Company, they should have a wiki or a place that they can go to where it's like I'm new help and there should be

313
0:23:42.420 --> 0:23:47.940
A list of shit that they can go look at and feel less new moving was for an actual Neos question Lord

314
0:23:48.100 --> 0:23:51.060
Tremieson he says well when the inventory UI be made better

315
0:23:51.060 --> 0:23:56.420
So the venturing UI is part of our UI rework which is often misconstrued as bigger or smaller than it actually is

316
0:23:56.580 --> 0:24:02.340
So I'm gonna go ahead and link you to the Neos public roadmap board for the UI rework

317
0:24:02.340 --> 0:24:04.340
I've seen a lot of people who will link to the

318
0:24:05.100 --> 0:24:07.580
one github issue we have for the

319
0:24:07.580 --> 0:24:14.660
Overall UI overhaul, but that one doesn't really convey the sort of picture of the UI. So here is

320
0:24:15.260 --> 0:24:19.340
Projects 2 which is our UI overall you'll see that there is items on there for doing that

321
0:24:19.340 --> 0:24:24.660
We don't have any plans to currently do that as we're on a little bit of a freeze when it comes to that the next thing

322
0:24:24.660 --> 0:24:30.740
That we will do on the UI is the settings page that settings page just allows us to add additional settings

323
0:24:30.740 --> 0:24:33.600
You can see bullet points there in the preparing gathering info segment

324
0:24:33.600 --> 0:24:40.020
Which says redesign settings all sorts of stuff there before anyone else ask as well. Yes, everything will have a dark mode option

325
0:24:40.500 --> 0:24:42.300
basically anything that is

326
0:24:42.300 --> 0:24:47.580
Light mode is old and needs to be that includes the inventory the contact system anything else

327
0:24:47.580 --> 0:24:52.980
That's like light mode that includes inspectors. So there'll be a dark mode. There will also still be a light mode anything

328
0:24:52.980 --> 0:24:56.220
It's just like there'll be the possibility to have either depending on which one you'd prefer

329
0:24:56.860 --> 0:25:01.820
But it's a good measure for what needs to be changed. But yeah, the inventory UI will be changed at some point

330
0:25:01.820 --> 0:25:05.540
I can't really answer when moving on to Risa's question Risa says

331
0:25:05.540 --> 0:25:10.700
Do you have any suggestions on how to mitigate room and correct local asset transfer issue where local assets uploaded not transfer to the host

332
0:25:10.700 --> 0:25:12.380
Or who's from?

333
0:25:12.380 --> 0:25:13.900
Okay

334
0:25:13.900 --> 0:25:18.500
I don't receive I will add that one to my list as well. I'm sorry. I just haven't read that part of the code

335
0:25:18.500 --> 0:25:24.140
Oh, I pasted that into my notepad and it just like pasted a bunch of discord stuff including emojis. I don't need that

336
0:25:24.860 --> 0:25:26.820
Specs, I'm glad to see that you did a point point

337
0:25:26.820 --> 0:25:33.740
I'm presuming mean PowerPoint on Redis, which is a very fast in memory database cache. That's a great tagline for it

338
0:25:33.740 --> 0:25:37.220
That is perfect. So I've used it for both of those things. I just couldn't think of the

339
0:25:38.220 --> 0:25:42.940
Sentence for it moving forwards. I know there's way to upload tremors and again

340
0:25:42.940 --> 0:25:45.380
I know there's a way to upload pictures very easily from PC to news

341
0:25:45.380 --> 0:25:47.580
But it's way to download a picture from news to PC

342
0:25:47.580 --> 0:25:51.500
Yeah, grab the picture open up your context menu and it'll say save a screenshot that'll go to

343
0:25:51.500 --> 0:25:57.220
Your home folder which is like your wherever all your shit is and inside the pictures folder

344
0:25:57.220 --> 0:26:01.140
There'll be a folder called me SVR. It'll be saved there if that doesn't work because like

345
0:26:01.740 --> 0:26:05.860
It's a picture that's weird for some reason or you can't use that

346
0:26:05.860 --> 0:26:07.860
There's a tool which is in

347
0:26:08.180 --> 0:26:12.580
someone's public folder that you can shoot a picture with and then it'll act like a screenshot and you can save it there if

348
0:26:12.620 --> 0:26:16.900
That doesn't work as in if that like hold it and then use the context menu doesn't work

349
0:26:16.900 --> 0:26:24.380
you can hold the picture go to your file browser and hit the plus and it'll start an export window for that picture and then

350
0:26:24.380 --> 0:26:27.660
You can export it. I did notice a couple of people doing this. I will bring it up

351
0:26:27.660 --> 0:26:34.540
I've noticed a couple of people that will do all four of those so they'll take the picture which actually saves it twice

352
0:26:34.540 --> 0:26:38.260
It's saved to the Steam screenshot location and your pictures near SVR folder

353
0:26:38.260 --> 0:26:43.300
So there's two copies of the photo then they'll export it as a screenshot using the context menu item

354
0:26:43.300 --> 0:26:48.420
That's three times that picture has been saved and then they'll use the file browser to also export it

355
0:26:48.420 --> 0:26:53.540
Which means that photo exists four times on their computer. So don't do that. Please choose just one

356
0:26:54.260 --> 0:27:00.660
Moving forwards to no user found. Is there any tools in the earth? You'd like to be more streamlined avatar creator full-body creator

357
0:27:01.900 --> 0:27:05.400
Anything to do with the slicing materials? I use those all the time right now and I hate them

358
0:27:05.900 --> 0:27:08.420
there's just a bunch of bugs I need to fix and

359
0:27:08.420 --> 0:27:10.420
And

360
0:27:11.340 --> 0:27:14.380
No, not really there's lots of stuff that we need to but like if you like

361
0:27:14.380 --> 0:27:17.980
You know, it was like the top list avatar creator full-body calibrator are the top ones

362
0:27:19.420 --> 0:27:23.540
Hamish likes the slicing materials and doing weird stuff with them

363
0:27:23.540 --> 0:27:26.140
I spent three hours figuring out the mathematics for one

364
0:27:26.140 --> 0:27:27.260
I still don't know what's going on

365
0:27:27.260 --> 0:27:33.000
but I did look at it the volumetric 3d slice II thing the my brain uses such the

366
0:27:33.000 --> 0:27:38.480
World browser for medical and you can go look at my brain inside Neos if you didn't know that go look at my brain

367
0:27:38.480 --> 0:27:45.120
It's in Neos my actual brain look for medical in the world browser that rendering I think is a raymarch shader

368
0:27:45.120 --> 0:27:46.640
I looked at the code. I don't know shade of code

369
0:27:46.640 --> 0:27:50.400
I looked at that and I'm like, that's the closest thing to ray marching I've ever read. It's cool

370
0:27:50.640 --> 0:27:54.160
That's all the questions we have and we are at the end of time

371
0:27:54.160 --> 0:27:59.840
So mystic and global if you have a question, please type it otherwise no more questions

372
0:27:59.840 --> 0:28:02.620
A global entity says will it be custom shade of support?

373
0:28:03.320 --> 0:28:05.320
sort of

374
0:28:05.720 --> 0:28:07.480
Sort of

375
0:28:07.480 --> 0:28:14.680
We can't do unity shaders. So you're not gonna have unity shaders. Sorry about that. It also looks like for the initial in

376
0:28:15.480 --> 0:28:19.400
Support of custom shaders also won't be writing raw shader code. It will be

377
0:28:19.960 --> 0:28:24.240
Composing shaders using a shader node graph in a similar way to how blender does it?

378
0:28:24.240 --> 0:28:30.040
Which will give you like an immense freedom to make shaders, but won't be raw shader code

379
0:28:30.480 --> 0:28:33.420
And then mystic says the cures of dark mode is any information that we talked about

380
0:28:33.840 --> 0:28:37.720
No, we haven't really done any designs in the area, but

381
0:28:38.880 --> 0:28:40.800
It'll be dark

382
0:28:40.800 --> 0:28:42.280
thumbs up

383
0:28:42.280 --> 0:28:46.480
With that we're here to leave things off and get started on some other stuff

384
0:28:46.480 --> 0:28:47.540
If you have any additional questions

385
0:28:47.540 --> 0:28:52.520
Please go ahead and direct message me them drop them in the questions help section drop them in the sheet for next week

386
0:28:52.520 --> 0:28:56.000
And always remember stay awesome. Oh and Neos has mirrors

387
0:28:56.000 --> 0:29:00.320
I don't know why I have to say this but there's a rumor going around that we don't have mirrors. We have mirrors

388
0:29:00.320 --> 0:29:26.320
I'll see you next time. Bye. Bye
