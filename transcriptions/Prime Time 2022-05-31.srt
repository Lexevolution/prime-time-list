1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.320
Okay, welcome to office hours with prime peace. Feel free to ask any I

2
0:00:04.960 --> 0:00:07.920
Have outlook alerts on and that was very loud anyway

3
0:00:08.160 --> 0:00:11.840
Feel free to ask any questions you would like over in the office hours channel

4
0:00:11.840 --> 0:00:14.960
Which is two channels above this one just type your question, and I will get to it as soon as I can

5
0:00:15.400 --> 0:00:18.680
Whatever you want to ask okay, so usually we only take

6
0:00:19.680 --> 0:00:24.880
Neos questions, but I'll make an exception for Morbius, so yeah, I've seen Morbius. It's incredible. I've watched it four times

7
0:00:24.880 --> 0:00:33.000
It's like the best film ever. I'm Aaron asks for someone excuse me. Hold on one second. Okay. I almost died off camera off mic

8
0:00:33.920 --> 0:00:37.800
Okay, I'm Aaron asks someone who is not to follow the game is out of the loop

9
0:00:37.800 --> 0:00:42.240
But it's been happened last few months and he changes to the devs community moderation helpers. It's what I'm looking for um

10
0:00:42.800 --> 0:00:44.160
No man changes to the game

11
0:00:44.160 --> 0:00:46.760
You can check the announcements channel the new subject channel for anything

12
0:00:46.760 --> 0:00:51.840
There'll be changes to the game they'll understand how things are slow to read the announcements channel for more information on that front

13
0:00:51.840 --> 0:00:56.440
Um moderation has been a little bit busy. We're just trying to keep people safe regardless. What's happening

14
0:00:56.440 --> 0:00:59.160
So you check the devlog channel? There's been a couple of updates to

15
0:01:00.440 --> 0:01:03.400
guidelines and policies mostly around the sort of adult content route

16
0:01:04.120 --> 0:01:10.880
Adult content completely comes up basically like every moderation office hours it comes up. I don't particularly understand why it's

17
0:01:11.600 --> 0:01:14.680
Very simple of course read the guidelines for the official stance here

18
0:01:14.680 --> 0:01:20.800
But my TLDR of the official stance is if you're doing naughty stuff or have naughty stuff on your avatar or inventory

19
0:01:20.800 --> 0:01:24.880
It should be in a private world this includes hiding it various sort of

20
0:01:25.640 --> 0:01:30.920
Faculties there just go to a private world. It's that simple. Oh and and don't

21
0:01:31.680 --> 0:01:32.760
accidentally

22
0:01:32.760 --> 0:01:39.600
Sexual activity here someone from across the map don't do that go to a damn private world and do it there

23
0:01:39.600 --> 0:01:41.600
We have no problem with it in a private world

24
0:01:42.120 --> 0:01:46.960
Do you combine consent as well everyone needs to be consenting to view their content and interact in that way?

25
0:01:46.960 --> 0:01:54.120
Check the guidelines for more information. Yes, check the guidelines for the official word and more information

26
0:01:55.880 --> 0:02:03.760
No, it just always comes up as for helpers and mentors we brought some new mentor leads recently including mentor leads in

27
0:02:04.160 --> 0:02:06.160
Different locales we now have a Korean

28
0:02:06.520 --> 0:02:10.820
mentor lead team and a Japanese mentor lead team which is expanding mentors into

29
0:02:10.820 --> 0:02:18.140
Those I want to say markets because that's the phrase I would use at work, but it's not that correct, but we'll do it markets

30
0:02:18.860 --> 0:02:21.600
Which is great. It lets more people help out

31
0:02:22.140 --> 0:02:24.140
cultures would also be correct, but

32
0:02:24.580 --> 0:02:28.380
Yes, time zones would probably be like whatever. You know I mean um

33
0:02:29.140 --> 0:02:35.860
That's cool. They're doing a bunch of stuff there, which is fantastic as we get more momentous going um with those new leads coming on

34
0:02:35.860 --> 0:02:41.700
I'm sure you'll see some new walk or stuff has stuff happening with those people soon for those who aren't aware mentors are

35
0:02:42.260 --> 0:02:44.700
team of community volunteers who

36
0:02:45.180 --> 0:02:48.900
Will help you out in game look for the green question mark above their head they are

37
0:02:49.660 --> 0:02:54.080
Able to help you out of any questions that you do have very interesting question here from Ozzy who asks

38
0:02:54.740 --> 0:02:59.100
Do you have any tips on managing a sessions voice settings as far as in using audio?

39
0:02:59.980 --> 0:03:01.940
as in using

40
0:03:01.940 --> 0:03:08.260
audio config ejection of it all the times it's really difficult to balance in making sure people are being heard while making sure our further people

41
0:03:08.260 --> 0:03:10.260
out don't over on the conversation I

42
0:03:11.780 --> 0:03:17.500
Hate the default settings on Neos is audio stuff I

43
0:03:18.260 --> 0:03:22.620
Don't particularly know why I hate them and so I haven't been able to sort of

44
0:03:23.140 --> 0:03:29.500
Formulate a plan to maybe fix that but I have really no audio filter so for conversations happening

45
0:03:29.500 --> 0:03:31.940
I need to listen to it and so if I can hear the entire world

46
0:03:31.940 --> 0:03:37.620
I'm in like five different conversations, and I you know I can't focus on that in the future one conversation there

47
0:03:37.620 --> 0:03:39.620
There are systems that you can use

48
0:03:40.060 --> 0:03:41.860
So as he mentions audio injection

49
0:03:41.860 --> 0:03:47.940
That's where you put a slot into the auto inject slot which is on the user spawner that's at the top in the controllers

50
0:03:47.940 --> 0:03:50.580
Usually of the slot hierarchy, and then you ought to

51
0:03:51.440 --> 0:03:53.360
inject

52
0:03:53.360 --> 0:03:57.660
Audio, I can't remember the name of the component. I think I've got a tutorial somewhere. I'll double-check

53
0:03:57.660 --> 0:04:02.140
I've never really like understood a lot of those settings though. I need to kind of like do a

54
0:04:02.780 --> 0:04:09.060
Using corporate terminology. I need to do a deep dive on some of those options so I can get those out to you

55
0:04:09.060 --> 0:04:12.020
I didn't notice a couple of worlds which had settings which I liked

56
0:04:12.460 --> 0:04:13.660
and

57
0:04:13.660 --> 0:04:15.660
they came from

58
0:04:16.100 --> 0:04:18.520
a world I was in with

59
0:04:19.860 --> 0:04:22.180
with Nami, I think it was and

60
0:04:22.180 --> 0:04:29.580
And Nami uses one which is in hideous folder basically I noticed Nami was hosting a world that had good audio settings in it

61
0:04:29.580 --> 0:04:34.120
And I'm just like can I get those I want those for my worlds, and then Nami said it was in

62
0:04:34.820 --> 0:04:38.860
Hiddies public folder, and then I never really looked at that again

63
0:04:39.700 --> 0:04:45.380
Lots of worlds have it good. I also like the worlds that do the the manual culling of beyond audio

64
0:04:46.420 --> 0:04:50.620
It's debatable whether you know there's much benefit from doing it for other reasons

65
0:04:50.620 --> 0:04:55.780
But for audio if I like a certain distance away, then turn off the audio that does it too, and then you've got no like

66
0:04:56.580 --> 0:04:58.580
complications there

67
0:04:58.700 --> 0:05:00.220
It's it's fun

68
0:05:00.220 --> 0:05:02.400
I really don't like figure out what the problem is

69
0:05:02.900 --> 0:05:08.860
within Neos actual and then get a better way to sort of represent that talk about it and provide content for it because I just

70
0:05:08.860 --> 0:05:14.740
Find it like it's confusing and because there's no like real big sort of Bible about how those settings work

71
0:05:14.740 --> 0:05:22.140
There's also here say that goes around and then lots of what I do which is just stealing it is configuration

72
0:05:22.140 --> 0:05:25.500
What I remember to pick it up is what other people are doing as well

73
0:05:25.500 --> 0:05:28.900
So there's no real like standard of understanding it so people just end up with like oh, yeah

74
0:05:28.900 --> 0:05:31.180
I use the system or this system or this particular whatever

75
0:05:31.780 --> 0:05:36.780
To get it done. It needs to be done the second part of your question though talks about

76
0:05:38.540 --> 0:05:40.900
Overwhelming conversations, and I didn't want to make sure that you know

77
0:05:40.900 --> 0:05:45.580
That's also something that can happen sort of culturally as well. So make sure keeping an eye on that one

78
0:05:46.220 --> 0:05:51.620
a really good point here is to move off of the damn spawn point I

79
0:05:52.380 --> 0:05:54.020
Cannot stand it like you know

80
0:05:54.020 --> 0:05:59.580
There's a circular ring usually for the common spawn point that we see in a lot of worlds and people just sort of congregate on

81
0:05:59.580 --> 0:06:03.820
Top of it or build logics on top of it or have conversations on top of it

82
0:06:03.820 --> 0:06:06.820
Like just move like a couple of meters outside of that ring

83
0:06:06.820 --> 0:06:11.580
please because otherwise you're constantly being interrupted by people joining or and

84
0:06:12.620 --> 0:06:18.300
Being in your conversation like there's a huge world all the worlds are huge like huger than you would usually know

85
0:06:19.420 --> 0:06:24.900
Huger than worlds which are big the one of the MMC entries was really really big the whole town

86
0:06:25.260 --> 0:06:31.220
But still that wasn't as big as you can go in here. So just like move out a little bit

87
0:06:31.900 --> 0:06:35.040
Additionally be careful when you're having a conversation that you're not interrupting someone

88
0:06:35.040 --> 0:06:37.320
I've had it so many cases in fact the most common occurrence

89
0:06:37.320 --> 0:06:39.460
I have that's related to conversational audio is

90
0:06:39.820 --> 0:06:44.540
I'm having a conversation with someone and someone else who's new to the world walks up to me and says oh hi

91
0:06:44.660 --> 0:06:46.860
It's like well guys we're in the middle of a sentence

92
0:06:47.300 --> 0:06:51.860
Like we're in the middle of a sentence here, right? So if you could wait and then we can say hi

93
0:06:52.420 --> 0:06:55.100
but they just don't seem to understand like

94
0:06:55.740 --> 0:07:00.340
They don't seem to understand that like, you know, if there are two people talking and they've just joined the world

95
0:07:00.340 --> 0:07:03.020
They can't come and show me their multi-tool. It's very frustrating

96
0:07:03.020 --> 0:07:06.860
Yeah, I kind of like have a couple of those

97
0:07:07.820 --> 0:07:11.940
There's also the ranty page I have on the wiki which is basically like if you disagree of this

98
0:07:11.940 --> 0:07:18.100
I don't care like it's just what I I think I kind of like that sort of safety net as well

99
0:07:18.100 --> 0:07:23.020
It's like here is my opinion if you disagree. I don't care and it's not I don't care negatively. It's like I

100
0:07:23.020 --> 0:07:44.620
I cool have fun. Um, I'm logged out of the wiki. That's there we go. Yeah, so I wrote this page and it's basically just like I don't mind if you disagree with me, I don't mind but you know, here is here is what I would I would rather people keep in mind

101
0:07:45.020 --> 0:07:46.700
It goes also things like that

102
0:07:46.700 --> 0:07:51.900
There's a whole section on audio which is like just just just just be considerate is what I'm thinking

103
0:07:51.900 --> 0:07:54.500
I think if a lot more people realize the way

104
0:07:55.020 --> 0:08:02.660
Virtual reality like they broke down that word virtual reality like some of these cultural problems. We have wouldn't exist if it was a real space

105
0:08:04.260 --> 0:08:07.940
Just take one of the hangout words you've been in like a bar or you know

106
0:08:07.940 --> 0:08:14.300
Like a some house or whatever if you went to my house and you were problematic

107
0:08:14.300 --> 0:08:17.980
I would ask you to leave if you went to my house and you

108
0:08:17.980 --> 0:08:23.660
And you shot a knockback gun at me. You would be arrested and or shot. So

109
0:08:24.700 --> 0:08:27.580
Keep that in mind and be considerate with the people that you're praying

110
0:08:27.860 --> 0:08:32.620
Unnamed cyborg cat says if everyone lived in a digital world economics wouldn't really be a thing because there's no scarcity

111
0:08:33.540 --> 0:08:35.900
There would probably still be scarcity in terms of

112
0:08:37.220 --> 0:08:39.220
like electricity

113
0:08:39.780 --> 0:08:44.500
Yeah, Lex says, what do you think is the best way to save and distribute logics templates?

114
0:08:44.500 --> 0:08:50.660
Um, I just like parent stuff to a cube and add it to someone make sure the cube isn't named cube

115
0:08:50.740 --> 0:08:55.340
Other people use blueprints redprints. I'm quite fond of the Japanese

116
0:08:55.940 --> 0:08:57.020
communities

117
0:08:57.020 --> 0:08:59.020
3d pack because that

118
0:08:59.500 --> 0:09:05.700
Isn't a blueprint. It's just like the parts or features of traditional blueprints where you can pack

119
0:09:06.140 --> 0:09:08.140
Into a named object really easily

120
0:09:08.140 --> 0:09:13.980
Logics is better in 3d. I will like die on my soapbox here. Logics is better in 3d

121
0:09:14.700 --> 0:09:20.980
You can you know friend end nerves curve nodes not knows and bend your nerves. That might be painful

122
0:09:20.980 --> 0:09:24.980
You can bend nodes you can curve nodes. You can program in 3d space

123
0:09:24.980 --> 0:09:29.180
There is a lot more sort of dimensions available to you. Then if you just stick it like on there

124
0:09:29.180 --> 0:09:31.180
I also think that blueprints

125
0:09:31.580 --> 0:09:33.420
encourage late packing

126
0:09:33.420 --> 0:09:39.100
what I mean by late packing is my philosophy when building something in neo assist a pack early and often and

127
0:09:39.500 --> 0:09:44.300
To communicate between logics groups as best as you can using whatever methodology

128
0:09:44.300 --> 0:09:49.820
You can have a good example here is like would you build your entire game on one blueprint?

129
0:09:49.820 --> 0:09:52.460
No, would you build your entire game on several?

130
0:09:53.340 --> 0:09:59.580
Micro blueprints that stick into the larger blueprint probably that's what a lot of people do whereas mine is like, okay

131
0:09:59.580 --> 0:10:08.860
well the logic for the like NPC is in the NPC and the logic for the weapon is in the weapon and the logic for the

132
0:10:09.500 --> 0:10:11.500
characters in the character

133
0:10:11.900 --> 0:10:16.460
Usually the only sort of like global logics group I have is like a controller or something like that

134
0:10:16.460 --> 0:10:21.100
Which is just like oh, you know, it's nighttime. The zombies come out. It's daytime. The zombies die

135
0:10:21.660 --> 0:10:26.940
Sort of remembering that mean now night. I daytime anyway moving onwards here

136
0:10:26.940 --> 0:10:33.260
Aaron asks, what's your opinion on entrance or respawn noises for example someone plays like 30 seconds of a song in my world today when they joined

137
0:10:33.820 --> 0:10:36.140
Don't do that. So I like to think of like

138
0:10:37.500 --> 0:10:41.900
WWE or the equivalents and other television networks or whatever

139
0:10:42.540 --> 0:10:47.660
When it comes to respawning I hate those sometimes sometimes they're funny. Sometimes they're kind of cute

140
0:10:47.660 --> 0:10:50.460
But like most of the time it's just like what the hell

141
0:10:51.260 --> 0:10:54.380
It's great for WWE because it gets you sort of emotionally invested in it

142
0:10:54.380 --> 0:11:00.700
Wrestlers that you're watching enter the stage, but it doesn't need to be like that in years. It really does not

143
0:11:01.340 --> 0:11:03.340
you can see

144
0:11:03.340 --> 0:11:07.180
one of my favorite examples of that being a

145
0:11:07.740 --> 0:11:12.540
Wrestler called Alberto del Rio who's in WWE actually named my like like, you know

146
0:11:12.540 --> 0:11:17.340
You put a name into like an account to make it I named my Hulu account Alberto del Rio

147
0:11:17.340 --> 0:11:22.140
It's what I log in it says like hi Alberto del Rio what you gonna watch today that makes me giggle each time

148
0:11:22.140 --> 0:11:27.340
What you gonna watch today that makes me giggle each time. It's like a sort of like weird privacy thing, right?

149
0:11:27.420 --> 0:11:31.420
It's like first name last day, but I'm like not my first name not my last name

150
0:11:31.660 --> 0:11:32.140
anyway

151
0:11:32.140 --> 0:11:38.300
when he comes in he'll usually come in using like a really expensive car and I know because it's a production that they've rented this

152
0:11:38.380 --> 0:11:41.100
Car from like a car rental place and it's a new car every week

153
0:11:41.180 --> 0:11:46.460
And I'm like this rental car place is just making a lot of money and he'll honk his horn and there's like, you know

154
0:11:46.460 --> 0:11:53.580
Spanish Mexican music going off and he's just like he's got his own announcer who will roll the arse of Alberto del Rio

155
0:11:53.900 --> 0:11:57.900
Incredibly loudly. I can't do that and it's just like albo mate

156
0:11:57.900 --> 0:12:04.300
Could you get into the ring and fight and then I would care I would be more invested about who you are as a person

157
0:12:05.420 --> 0:12:09.980
Same thing goes with those respawn noises. Like I don't need to hear that you've respawned

158
0:12:09.980 --> 0:12:14.700
I don't need to hear that you've arrived you arriving should be hello again

159
0:12:14.700 --> 0:12:19.340
Think of going around to someone's house for a nice meal. It'd be like hi. I bought a bottle of wine

160
0:12:20.300 --> 0:12:23.500
And then you know, you might not know everyone at the table. So you go like, oh, yeah

161
0:12:23.820 --> 0:12:27.820
I'm i'm prime's friend. We met at in a college and I do

162
0:12:28.460 --> 0:12:33.020
Particle accelerator research cool that's taught me more about you as a person

163
0:12:33.580 --> 0:12:36.780
Then five bars of the most annoying song I can imagine

164
0:12:37.260 --> 0:12:41.820
Or I don't know the halo theme tune when you spawn in I don't need it. I don't want it

165
0:12:41.820 --> 0:12:45.420
I don't understand why you do it. So be considerate and please don't do it

166
0:12:45.660 --> 0:12:50.620
Do also remember that there are some people who sound sensitive like myself. I am like I said, I have no audio filter

167
0:12:50.620 --> 0:12:52.300
So I hear everything

168
0:12:52.300 --> 0:12:55.340
and also some people that have you know difficulty hearing and

169
0:12:55.980 --> 0:13:00.060
They want the sounds that they hear to be associated with the activity that they're doing

170
0:13:00.380 --> 0:13:04.620
And not having an abrupt rate if they're playing a game, you know, they'll understand it like hey i'm playing a game

171
0:13:04.620 --> 0:13:06.700
There's gonna be guns and explosions and stuff like that

172
0:13:06.700 --> 0:13:12.300
But if they're just hanging out in a nearest world and someone launches in and I don't know it does one of alberto da rio's

173
0:13:12.460 --> 0:13:14.460
Like openings, what's the point?

174
0:13:15.660 --> 0:13:16.620
um

175
0:13:16.620 --> 0:13:19.740
Onwards to more of a another question from izzy

176
0:13:20.300 --> 0:13:23.580
So I stopped talking about ww wrestling. I don't watch it these days

177
0:13:23.580 --> 0:13:28.700
I used to have a roommate back at university who would uh, always watch it and

178
0:13:29.100 --> 0:13:32.380
Because I had you know infinite free time being a student. I would always watch it too

179
0:13:32.380 --> 0:13:36.620
Um, but I would just giggle at it because it's all like a bit of fun

180
0:13:36.700 --> 0:13:40.540
Anyway, moving on to ozzie's question more of a session host admin question

181
0:13:40.540 --> 0:13:43.020
How do you personally go about dealing with users not following special rules?

182
0:13:43.180 --> 0:13:46.860
Uh, but also how do you confront them assuming it's an instant kick ban or whatever?

183
0:13:46.940 --> 0:13:48.940
Sometimes it is an instant kick or ban. Um

184
0:13:49.340 --> 0:13:51.100
That usually leads to like weird situations

185
0:13:51.100 --> 0:13:53.900
i've had it a lot of times in the past where people think that um

186
0:13:54.140 --> 0:14:00.140
staff members shouldn't be able to ban people from their sessions because it looks like uh banning them from the platform or

187
0:14:00.140 --> 0:14:03.180
or putting out a sort of community mandate that they

188
0:14:03.900 --> 0:14:05.900
um

189
0:14:05.900 --> 0:14:07.740
That they are, you know a bad person

190
0:14:07.740 --> 0:14:11.660
It's not that like when I host a session and I ban you from that session

191
0:14:12.140 --> 0:14:14.140
I'm kicking out you out of my front room

192
0:14:14.300 --> 0:14:18.380
I if you have a question on discord or I come to your session or you need help you message me for help

193
0:14:18.460 --> 0:14:19.660
I'm, still going to give it to you

194
0:14:19.660 --> 0:14:23.820
It just means you're not allowed in my living room and you're not allowed to use my toilets

195
0:14:24.380 --> 0:14:28.540
And the bowl of mms on the counter is not for you. Please leave. Um

196
0:14:28.540 --> 0:14:32.060
So if you do get kicked or banned a you've probably done something a bit bad

197
0:14:32.380 --> 0:14:34.860
Be message me about it and don't be angry about it

198
0:14:35.020 --> 0:14:39.260
There's lots of good cases where people are like angry about rules or they feel upset or they feel you know

199
0:14:39.660 --> 0:14:43.340
Hard done by but it's like it's a rule and it's a broken rule, right?

200
0:14:43.340 --> 0:14:48.300
There can be a healthy conversation about that. It doesn't need to be argumentative or aggressive. A good example is um

201
0:14:48.940 --> 0:14:51.340
I don't allow in my sessions the collar bells

202
0:14:51.500 --> 0:14:55.820
There is probably at least one person who wears one of those bells on their on their neck in this

203
0:14:55.820 --> 0:15:01.660
Stereotypically, it's just everywhere. I don't allow those in my chest my sessions and when I they come in it's usually on a rule board

204
0:15:01.660 --> 0:15:04.700
Sometimes it's not on it because I forget to spawn it out or I just haven't

205
0:15:05.420 --> 0:15:10.300
But if it's on there, they'll read it and they'll get offended and they'll say something like but this is part of my identity

206
0:15:10.700 --> 0:15:17.820
And i'm like, okay part of my identity is the bass farts occur whenever i'm in the session loud bass farts occur like all the time

207
0:15:18.220 --> 0:15:23.820
That's part of my identity. Um, and what I mean by that is trying to sort of like illustrate I do a bad job

208
0:15:23.820 --> 0:15:31.820
Sometimes i'm tired. What i'm trying to do i'll explain it is i'm trying to illustrate that there is a line between identity and being considerate

209
0:15:31.820 --> 0:15:38.140
And in some cases by not following the rules of a session that you're in you're stepping over that line

210
0:15:38.140 --> 0:15:42.300
You're no longer being considerate and at that point you're subject to me having a talk with you

211
0:15:42.700 --> 0:15:47.500
Nine times out of ten, uh when I confront someone about my rules, they'll get offended and leave and it's really sad

212
0:15:47.580 --> 0:15:49.980
I don't really know how to deal that if anyone has any ideas go for it

213
0:15:50.140 --> 0:15:53.180
Like I tried it in the nicest possible way. I'm like, hey there's a rule over there

214
0:15:53.180 --> 0:15:56.220
it says no collar bells and so please and they'll just be like

215
0:15:56.620 --> 0:15:59.260
Very offended about it and leave and I usually don't hear from them again

216
0:15:59.740 --> 0:16:05.980
And that is because I think in society we have a lot of sort of issues around confrontation and arguments and debates

217
0:16:06.620 --> 0:16:10.220
If anyone went to you know, a stereotypical high school in the u.s

218
0:16:10.300 --> 0:16:14.540
You probably had debate club at some point you might not have been in it, but you would be aware that it existed

219
0:16:15.020 --> 0:16:20.060
Um debate club is a great thing that tries to teach probably badly. I don't know. I was never near debate club

220
0:16:20.060 --> 0:16:22.380
Um about how to debate about things

221
0:16:23.180 --> 0:16:29.580
But I believe it should be expanded in society to sort of teach us how to argue about things people see arguments as sort of

222
0:16:30.140 --> 0:16:33.820
Fiery charged things like they're on tv shows, you know people throwing stuff

223
0:16:33.820 --> 0:16:37.260
Maybe someone gets shot at the end of it if it's a stereotypical tv show

224
0:16:37.580 --> 0:16:43.900
But arguments can be as simple as like I disagree with you about this and that's fine and you disagree with me

225
0:16:43.980 --> 0:16:45.100
That's also fine

226
0:16:45.100 --> 0:16:51.580
We will now go our separate ways and have a pizza a good way to look at it is to think about the uh question

227
0:16:51.900 --> 0:16:53.260
What's your favorite color?

228
0:16:53.260 --> 0:16:57.260
So if I ask anyone in here what your favorite color is you'll say a completely different answer to me

229
0:16:57.580 --> 0:17:00.540
And it's like that's fine. And then no one argues about it and we have fun

230
0:17:00.860 --> 0:17:05.580
Like every single argument should be about that once things go past a line and we get into like severe

231
0:17:05.980 --> 0:17:07.900
Issues then of course, maybe I won't talk to you

232
0:17:07.900 --> 0:17:12.700
But like generally if you break a rule i'm going to tell you about it and if you're offended by it leave

233
0:17:12.700 --> 0:17:19.420
But remember i'm not there to tell you off to do it negatively. I'm just like yeah, dude rule do uh

234
0:17:19.980 --> 0:17:24.140
Getting back to the actual realm of the question rather than me rambling about life. Um

235
0:17:24.860 --> 0:17:29.980
Make sure your rules are posted clearly make sure that the um action that you have on

236
0:17:30.620 --> 0:17:32.460
When a rule is broken is also clear

237
0:17:32.460 --> 0:17:33.020
So, you know

238
0:17:33.020 --> 0:17:36.540
You say something along the lines of here are the rules if you break the rules here is what's going to happen

239
0:17:36.940 --> 0:17:41.180
And then sure they might not have agreed to that or you know officially signed it in terms of contract law

240
0:17:41.180 --> 0:17:44.140
But everything that was there could have been set out for the expectations

241
0:17:44.220 --> 0:17:46.540
And if that user comes into the session and they are reading the room

242
0:17:46.620 --> 0:17:51.100
Which they should do see my tutorial and reading the room then they should understand what is going to happen

243
0:17:51.500 --> 0:17:53.900
I have any follow-up questions that go through I know that was a lot

244
0:17:54.380 --> 0:17:58.780
And then some people are like prime's really mean he is rules and he doesn't care if you break them

245
0:17:58.860 --> 0:18:02.060
He's just going to kick you like yeah, i'm sorry like read the rules

246
0:18:03.500 --> 0:18:05.740
If I come to your session i'll abide by your rules

247
0:18:06.060 --> 0:18:09.820
I haven't seen any rules that are difficult for me to abide by like I come to another session

248
0:18:09.820 --> 0:18:16.780
And someone's like use an optimized avatar and i'm like got it. Don't use a moly tool. Got it. Don't make loud sounds

249
0:18:17.480 --> 0:18:19.740
Absolutely. I don't do that. Don't do this

250
0:18:20.440 --> 0:18:25.100
Absolutely fine. So moving on to an actual another question. Um, so we stopped talking about rules

251
0:18:25.340 --> 0:18:29.180
Uh, i'm here and asked do you have any comments about the play account dropping throughout 2022? Why it's happening?

252
0:18:29.180 --> 0:18:31.180
What will done be all the consequences of it?

253
0:18:31.180 --> 0:18:37.340
Um, the play counts dying a lot because the game is sort of a feeling like it's stagnating and I don't understand too much. So

254
0:18:37.340 --> 0:18:41.340
So what the different reasons are for that, of course, I know a few see the announcement channel, etc

255
0:18:41.660 --> 0:18:45.680
But something which i'm seeing that we need a lot more of is we need a lot more creation

256
0:18:46.300 --> 0:18:49.740
And there are people making cool stuff and there are people making a lot of cool stuff

257
0:18:49.820 --> 0:18:53.740
But we just need more cool stuff, right? So just make cool stuff

258
0:18:54.620 --> 0:18:55.820
um

259
0:18:55.820 --> 0:19:01.260
I believe our population will go like up the moment we start getting like a

260
0:19:01.260 --> 0:19:07.260
A a sort of rolling ball of content combined with a rolling ball of non-content creating players

261
0:19:07.260 --> 0:19:11.580
Which is another problem we have when being considerate is not everyone wants to be a creator. So

262
0:19:12.220 --> 0:19:14.860
Stop trying to force them to be a creator. Maybe um

263
0:19:15.420 --> 0:19:19.420
What I mean by that is like if you go over to vr chat or any other like social vr platform

264
0:19:19.900 --> 0:19:22.460
Most people there have no idea how unity work

265
0:19:22.540 --> 0:19:28.220
They have no idea how like level design rendering textures materials assets meshes for vertices

266
0:19:28.220 --> 0:19:33.260
Sexes vertices they have no idea how those work and that's okay

267
0:19:33.740 --> 0:19:38.540
They're there to just socialize and hang out just think about how many people are in front of a mirror inside video chat right now

268
0:19:38.620 --> 0:19:40.300
And they know nothing technical

269
0:19:40.300 --> 0:19:45.260
Those are the players that we're missing and I think we'll get them when we have a lot better sort of like culture

270
0:19:45.740 --> 0:19:50.700
Of course, like some other things need to change see announcements and our ui needs to change see our roadmap, but like

271
0:19:51.400 --> 0:19:54.860
Culturally, there's lots that we can do there to kind of just sort of like be like cool

272
0:19:54.860 --> 0:20:01.660
Like maybe open a world where not everyone has builder like make that like not the norm but make it a session that you host

273
0:20:02.140 --> 0:20:07.420
Maybe finish a world maybe stop having sessions that are in just blank worlds. I see that a lot it kind of

274
0:20:08.140 --> 0:20:10.300
Puts off people when you know use it in the grid space

275
0:20:10.620 --> 0:20:15.440
Like you and I know that we can watch youtube memes and and play around with our logics multi-tools

276
0:20:15.900 --> 0:20:21.340
And make sounds when we when we launch and have bass farts come out of our bell on our collar

277
0:20:21.340 --> 0:20:26.480
Uh whenever we want in whatever world we want grid space or not grid space, but someone new to the platform

278
0:20:26.860 --> 0:20:30.460
They want to see cool worlds. They want to see cool creations. They want to see cool environments cool experiences

279
0:20:30.540 --> 0:20:33.180
I don't think we have that good example there being our game worlds

280
0:20:33.180 --> 0:20:38.540
We have tons of game worlds and you'll see them a lot on the monthly streams games of neos with with nex and the team

281
0:20:38.620 --> 0:20:39.260
there

282
0:20:39.260 --> 0:20:43.820
Um, but then they're not played like I helped make a among us vr

283
0:20:44.060 --> 0:20:49.260
Uh version in in in neos no one plays it and I don't blame anyone for playing that but

284
0:20:49.260 --> 0:20:53.580
But if you look at the among us vr game over in vr chat, everyone's playing it

285
0:20:53.660 --> 0:20:57.340
and again, that's because there are people there that are just to experience stuff and they're not there to

286
0:20:57.900 --> 0:21:04.300
um build stuff as for the player count before 2022 and before this uh, see announcement stuff, um,

287
0:21:05.020 --> 0:21:08.860
Honestly, it's probably just ui like it's probably ui. It was steadily climbing

288
0:21:09.420 --> 0:21:17.260
Um, we do still have cultural problems to solve the guidelines and moderation team working heavily heavily on that as is the mento team

289
0:21:17.260 --> 0:21:24.780
Um, but just think about what you can do to be more considerate to your fellow player, particularly if they are non-technical minded and uh,

290
0:21:25.340 --> 0:21:30.700
Maybe don't play massive base fart sound effects when you respawn and again if you do that's fine

291
0:21:30.780 --> 0:21:34.220
We're just going to agree to disagree. It's not like i'm going to hate you or anything. Um,

292
0:21:34.780 --> 0:21:39.740
I don't remember who said it to me the first but it was like someone said like hating stuff takes a lot of energy

293
0:21:40.300 --> 0:21:43.100
And they're right. I don't have time for that. But yeah, that's all the questions

294
0:21:43.100 --> 0:21:45.820
I know we got a like metaphysical here about the nature of reality

295
0:21:45.820 --> 0:21:50.860
So if you have any follow-up questions, do let me know we have three minutes left in this office. I have a section

296
0:21:51.420 --> 0:21:53.180
sure

297
0:21:53.180 --> 0:21:54.460
section

298
0:21:54.460 --> 0:21:55.420
so

299
0:21:55.420 --> 0:22:01.100
Feel free to ask any questions you have for the last uh, now two minutes. Otherwise, we'll end off at the end and uh,

300
0:22:01.820 --> 0:22:06.460
See you guys soon. Um, do you remember you can dm me anytime if any questions you have um,

301
0:22:06.780 --> 0:22:13.100
We'll usually answer sometimes i'll just be like cool posting the discord. Uh, but uh, you know keep talking

302
0:22:13.100 --> 0:22:19.100
That's the most important thing. Oh and finish a project pick up a project you had going in in neos and finish it

303
0:22:19.420 --> 0:22:22.380
Maybe cut the scope on it so you can finish it but finish it. Um

304
0:22:22.860 --> 0:22:26.720
I went to create jam a couple of weeks ago and I made a wheat farming simulator

305
0:22:27.180 --> 0:22:31.900
In like a couple of hours and it's cool and it exists. It's the crater jam on on carbohydrates carbs

306
0:22:32.300 --> 0:22:38.140
Uh, you can farm wheat you can plant seeds you can water them you can harvest the wheat and then you can uh,

307
0:22:38.140 --> 0:22:42.620
Grind it into flour. Of course. It's not accurate. But like I made it and I finished it. That's an experience there

308
0:22:42.940 --> 0:22:47.260
I might tutorial that at some point because it uses active colliders, which aren't bad. Remember

309
0:22:47.900 --> 0:22:49.740
X is that they frustrate themselves by having

310
0:22:50.300 --> 0:22:52.460
Start starting projects. They can't finish on one session

311
0:22:52.460 --> 0:22:54.860
So I have ideas for larger projects and I just push them up to one side

312
0:22:55.180 --> 0:23:00.620
I have pages and pages of projects pages majors of ideas and pages and pages of to-do lists. I say to-do lists because

313
0:23:01.260 --> 0:23:02.140
um

314
0:23:02.140 --> 0:23:06.940
I find I can easily do to-do list items if I write a list from scratch and the reason that happens is because

315
0:23:06.940 --> 0:23:12.940
I am writing it from scratch from memory, which is also sometimes a measure of like priority

316
0:23:13.500 --> 0:23:17.900
Like if i'm writing it from memory, it means i'm going to remember the highest priority items

317
0:23:17.980 --> 0:23:20.380
Whereas if I look back on a to-do list from a month ago

318
0:23:20.780 --> 0:23:25.020
It's just like what I needed to do what that does lead to forgotten stuff

319
0:23:25.020 --> 0:23:28.780
Like I need to ring my uk bank and tell them that they spelt my town that I live in wrong

320
0:23:29.260 --> 0:23:33.180
Very wrong like every single letter wrong. I don't know how but they did anyway

321
0:23:33.180 --> 0:23:37.020
That is it for office hours. If you have any comments questions
