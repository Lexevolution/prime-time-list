00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 Welcome to Office Hours, the weekly AMA where I ask your questions.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,320
 If you have any questions, please drop them in the Office Hours text chat.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,120
 There's a couple of channels above this one.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,160
 Office Hours, look for the thread, drop your questions in.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,360
 We'll answer them in the order that they appear.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,320
 I see a few people in the audience, so do get those questions coming in.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,160
 I'm going to go ahead and ping people again, just so they know that people are, you know,

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,240
 where we're starting.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,560
 And we'll see what comes up.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,800
 Alright, looking at the questions list, we have one question from Lex, who says,

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,640
 "Any in-progress MMC submissions you've enjoyed looking at?"

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,900
 The MMC Analyzer, which appears to now be a yearly, you know, appears every single competition

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,680
 project is always fascinating to see.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,560
 They publish it as quick as they can, and it sort of details sort of the entries that

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,960
 have been submitted and lets you see them.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,720
 Now those are always good to see, and this year they're kind of themed around the MMC

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,460
 poster, which is also good to see.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,120
 There are quite a lot of entries which have been submitted which are empty worlds, and

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,520
 I love that.

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,580
 Remember that you can submit an entry before it's finished, and it massively, massively

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,060
 reduces your stress on the day.

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,600
 You can edit an entry after it is submitted, you just need to save the world again.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,280
 You don't need to resubmit, you just save the world again.

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
 So I highly recommend publishing your world as soon as possible.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,940
 If you leave publishing your world to the last minute, you may have issues that you

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,000
 cannot resolve, and therefore you may be disqualified.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,940
 So publish early, and then you're fine.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,820
 Additionally in the last couple of days, please don't be rushing.

29
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,760
 Like the last couple of days, just polish, right?

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:43,100
 Think about audio, think about desktop users, think about testing and things like that.

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,300
 There are no further questions currently, so we're going to sit here in absolute silence

32
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,780
 till there are further questions.

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,820
 Another question from Lexi which says "Do you think there will be an update to NIRS

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,540
 to change the default world filter facet for MMC23 like there was last year for MMC2022?"

35
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,040
 I don't know, I haven't spoken to Fruks about it, the MMC team certainly do not require

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,260
 it, it's just a nice to have thing that sometimes occurs.

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,320
 Amber asks "Will there be a revamp rework of the wiki, the NIRS wiki plugin generates

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,240
 all of a default type of float and might be confusing, any possibility for interactive

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
 cards etc."

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,020
 I have huge plans for documentation and the wiki, which are all on hold, whilst I have

41
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,840
 zero control over the wiki.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,420
 So yeah.

43
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,120
 I am continually backing up the contents of the wiki as my main promise when it comes

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,900
 to the wiki and internal documentation, and any documentation that people write is I will

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,740
 preserve it to the best of my ability.

46
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,220
 So even if I have to stay up till 4am copying and pasting your text from the odd wiki into

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,620
 whatever new system might exist in the future, I will.

48
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,540
 Your contributions are not lost.

49
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,080
 Neutron Star asks "How are you?

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
 Has life been good?

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,720
 I am answering questions about NIRS, not myself."

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,340
 Let's keep it to NIRS.

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,020
 As we have no questions for the moment though, I just drank a ginormous amount of coffee.

54
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,000
 I've got to do a couple of errands after the office hours segment here, but then I hope

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,100
 to not leave the house for the rest of the evening which will be fantastic.

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,420
 Who wants to go outside?

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,420
 Outside's weird.

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,780
 There's stuff out there.

59
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,780
 Things.

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
 People.

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,980
 Hey, there are no other questions Lex, there's not much else to talk about.

62
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,820
 Question from Amber who says "Is the renderer Geens was working on made any progress?

63
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,260
 I believe you can take a look at the voidanchor discord or voidanchor patreon and voidanchor

64
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,260
 twitter for that.

65
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,060
 I will get links to those shortly."

66
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,500
 Okay, I found their github.

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,820
 Voidanchor is the group which are making the renderer.

68
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,420
 It's a complicated story.

69
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,300
 Sure they had a twitter, let me find it.

70
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,780
 You know when you're like typing in the search of twitter and it's just like I'm gonna show

71
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,300
 you exactly what you want but because you like stopped typing or continued typing I'm

72
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,400
 gonna remove that from the search list?

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,240
 It's like it's very confusing.

74
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,700
 I typed in the word voi and it came up with that tweet, that twitter account I just linked

75
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,100
 and then I typed D and it disappeared from the search results and I'm like what?

76
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,620
 I literally continued the name of the account and it's like no I'll remove that from the

77
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,820
 search results.

78
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,300
 What the hell twitter?

79
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,820
 Anyway Amber asks "Will Neos ever go open?

80
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,780
 Copy left in codebase licensing?"

81
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,280
 There is an issue on the Neos public issue list about open sourcing which you can go

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,800
 ahead and read.

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,440
 Open source.

84
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,560
 There it is.

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,920
 Shadow says "You're probably hearing this for the thousandth time and for that I'm sorry

86
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
 but there's only sort of plan when we get updates again.

87
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,760
 Do you have any idea whether it will be a gradual start or one massive update?

88
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,520
 Please read the announcements channel for any more updates on that situation."

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,680
 Blue says "With the dispute going on have the Neos team been allowed to work on the

90
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,280
 code and just not send it to prod or are you guys not allowed to search the code?"

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,420
 I am still touching the code, Frix is still touching the code, we're just not sending

92
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,100
 it to prod and yeah.

93
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,440
 Please read the announcements channel for more information.

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,140
 For those who are about ready to type but there are no updates in announcements, yeah

95
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,020
 like the most recent update is in announcements.

96
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
 That's all I got to tell.

97
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,620
 For those who are then about to tell are from that, well that's frustrating.

98
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
 Yeah I know.

99
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,940
 Quit my job for this stuff, it's really frustrating.

100
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,300
 Amber says "Any new components?"

101
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,700
 None which I can talk about.

102
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,160
 The remote connection point driver was added ages ago, I think you can search it in the

103
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,400
 update logs to find it.

104
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,000
 It was back when Frix was working on the circuit simulator stuff which is an educational product

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,400
 to teach children circuit boards and stuff like that using circuit board stuff.

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,000
 Sorry, it's been a while since that project existed.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,480
 We had hoped eventually we would be able to release that to the whole like crew, like

108
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
 to everyone on Neos.

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,460
 It would allow you to like, using Neos interaction that you're aware of, drag and drop capacitors

110
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,460
 onto a circuit board and then have electricity go through them.

111
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,740
 Of course simulate it, but like it would almost be like an additional language available to

112
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,460
 you built using the languages available in Neos so it was quite cool.

113
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,100
 I mentioned for medical, yeah for, so for the medical project that's actually a third

114
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,380
 party thing.

115
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:06,640
 I work for myself slash a sort of company that we haven't incorporated yet doing medical

116
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,160
 research with another user, but then with SHFR here on the Neos Discord we do medical

117
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
 projects.

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:22,800
 I need updates to the tube wire mesh to make it less twisty and seeing as I can read the

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,580
 source code, there is a humongous block of code in the tube wire mesh that's combated

120
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,340
 out that says this reduces twisting but I don't know how to fix it or something to that

121
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,960
 effect and that was made by Shrix.

122
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,680
 So at some point when I am able to I'm going to be looking at that code and trying to reduce

123
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,040
 the twist there.

124
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,300
 It's a complicated matter but it's nothing to do with actual Neos team stuff.

125
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,100
 Jackal says if there were one thing in the world of building that you would recommend

126
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,000
 a newbie go after first, what is it?

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,820
 Keep your ideas small.

128
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,480
 I've heard a lot of people who struggle to learn logics, I've said this a few times,

129
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,600
 I apologize if you've heard this rant before, who want to learn logics and their mechanism

130
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,360
 for learning logics is different than their mechanism for learning sort of everything

131
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,660
 else that they have in their life, which is very common and understandable.

132
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,440
 So their motivation for learning logics is probably like let's build a gun or maybe a

133
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,200
 game map or something really, really complicated like that.

134
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,400
 And so when they ask for help in learning logics, they want to jump ahead and they want

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
 to build a gun or they want to build something really, really complicated.

136
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,320
 It's important to remember to learn the basics before you learn the advanced stuff.

137
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,540
 So if you're struggling to learn logics, try adding two numbers together.

138
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,260
 And if you don't know how to do that, learn how to do that in logics.

139
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,820
 And then the moment that you can spawn those nodes which add two numbers together, you

140
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,580
 are not allowed to say that you don't know logics anymore because you know how to add

141
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,920
 two numbers together.

142
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,140
 You can say that you're not proficient or that you're a beginner in logics, but you

143
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,260
 actually know how to spawn those nodes.

144
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,720
 That's another part of learning is make sure that you are giving yourself credit where

145
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
 it's due.

146
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,660
 Yeah, okay, you don't know everything.

147
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,240
 You're not like a prime or a ukulele of the world who can do basically anything with a

148
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,880
 moment's notice, but you know how to add two numbers together.

149
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,160
 What do you want to do next?

150
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,440
 Let's try subtracting two numbers.

151
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,180
 And then you've learned two nodes, right?

152
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,960
 And then just keep building it from there.

153
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,160
 Good point of view on learning logics is to avoid any node which has an impulse, which

154
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,640
 is the white data type.

155
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,100
 Any impulse receiving or using node is a little bit more complicated.

156
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,240
 So try to stick to nodes that don't have impulses.

157
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,700
 Just start just whilst you're learning and you'll have a better time learning because

158
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,840
 the impulse nodes are more complicated.

159
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,640
 And then introduce a few impulse nodes later once you've learned those.

160
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:48,560
 Outside the world of logics, also consider learning just basic planning and sort of management

161
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,060
 of projects.

162
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,640
 We have this every single year with the MMC, and it's not reared its head yet, but I guarantee

163
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,020
 it will on what I call submission week, which is the week leading up to the first of March.

164
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,540
 People have no idea how to publish, they have no idea how to save a world, they have no

165
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,060
 idea how to edit the tags.

166
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,020
 It's like, go learn that right now.

167
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:12,060
 Contrary to popular opinion, I don't care, and the team don't care if you publish junk.

168
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,620
 So if you want to make a red grassy world and call it, sorry to pick on you but you

169
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,300
 are asking the question, jackal girls, red grass world, and you want to publish that

170
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,700
 as a world, go for it.

171
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,740
 It's great, thank you for making a world and publishing it to Neos.

172
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,900
 And in doing that, you'll learn how to publish and save worlds and edit tags and things like

173
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,840
 that before the submission deadline.

174
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,900
 And that leads to, again, just generic learning.

175
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,980
 On the topic of planning, the reason why that one's coming up a lot is, again, you know

176
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,540
 how many days there are till the end of the month, till the end of the MMC, yet we still

177
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,780
 have people that get to the end of it and their entry is not finished, or their entry

178
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,260
 is rushed.

179
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,620
 Those things can sort of do that.

180
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,740
 There's an article on learning things faster.

181
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:03,060
 I haven't validated every single part of this article, but I like the abbreviation, which

182
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,140
 keeps getting more letters.

183
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,140
 It used to be faster, now it's faster.

184
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,180
 So take a look at that one.

185
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,540
 So I'll summarize, but first of all, it's forget.

186
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,660
 So forget comes up a lot when it comes to logics, because people, they try to compare

187
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,660
 it to other programming languages.

188
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,180
 They're like, but I know Python, and it's like, okay, well, let's assume you didn't

189
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,180
 know Python.

190
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,340
 Would it make it easier to learn logics if you didn't think about Python all the time?

191
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,540
 And in some cases, yes, because it means that you wouldn't be comparing it back.

192
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,900
 So if we get people all the time that do this, they come in, and they're like, where are

193
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,760
 variables, where are ifs, where are functions, where are classes in logics?

194
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,260
 And those things, while they do exist, they exist in different ways.

195
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,220
 So if you forget what you know about the existing programming languages, but take the technical

196
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,500
 intuition, the technical logic, and apply that to logics, you might have a better time

197
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,700
 learning it.

198
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,300
 Active is a very important one as well.

199
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,780
 I've seen a lot of people who are unfortunately just lazy when it comes to learning.

200
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,380
 If you remember learning your ABCs, I mean, I can't speak for everyone, of course, but

201
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,940
 I had to write the word "a" on a piece of paper like 400 times.

202
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,860
 Like, it was an exercise sheet at school, and it just had like "a" and a line, and

203
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,220
 I had to just continually write "a," and I continually wrote "a" to learn how

204
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
 to write.

205
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,780
 And then I continually wrote "b," and it was boring.

206
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,220
 It was boring as hell.

207
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
 But I did that.

208
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,220
 I don't remember why.

209
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,020
 I was too young to remember it, but I do remember writing it.

210
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,540
 And now I can write the letter "a," and I don't even think about it.

211
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,660
 You need to be active in it.

212
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,820
 If you look at it, you're like, "Yeah, okay, learning is... you need active learning."

213
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,340
 State, that's a good one as well.

214
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,220
 I see a lot of people who try and learn in occupied worlds or try and learn whilst they're

215
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,300
 watching videos or try and learn whilst they're playing games.

216
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,620
 You need to focus on it a little bit.

217
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
 Teach is very good.

218
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,300
 You can see that through my stuff.

219
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,340
 If you learn something, great.

220
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,540
 If you then teach someone else what you've learned, you'll remember it better.

221
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,540
 It sort of activates different areas of your brain and makes the information easier.

222
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,180
 And we'll stop there, because that's the original abbreviation, which is FAST.

223
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:10,020
 There are two more letters in the new one.

224
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,460
 Amber asks, "Will there be updates for critical issues on the client side, such as memory

225
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,580
 leaker for WebM videos of a negative changing scale?"

226
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,580
 That's still a problem right now.

227
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,420
 "We will update if there are major breaking issues."

228
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,780
 That one comes into the sort of category of "Dr. Doctor, it hurts when I do this, so don't

229
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
 do this."

230
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,420
 The recent update -- well, I say recent, it's last year -- that we did was actually sort

231
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,300
 of like a remote code execution thing with Blender.

232
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,380
 So we patched that one, because that was like a high security issue.

233
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:46,820
 Whereas this one is like, maybe don't spawn WebM videos of negative changing scale.

234
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,940
 Critical is like an overused word when it comes to issues, when it comes to security,

235
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,620
 when it comes to urgency.

236
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,700
 If everything is critical, nothing is critical.

237
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,580
 So we evaluate stuff when we see it, and if we do evaluate it as critical, we will usually

238
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,140
 do a patch for it.

239
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,900
 That is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

240
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,580
 "Which reminds me, if you have a security issue like the Blender one, which we patched,

241
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,220
 see the changelog for information, please submit a security report following our security

242
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,220
 reporting policy."

243
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,620
 Lex says, "When publishing will already get set to public and submit it to the record

244
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,500
 to the G-NEO's group, would there be any way to even submit publish to another group?"

245
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,820
 There is actually a way to do that, but I don't know what it does.

246
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,980
 If you look at the world publishing platform, that's the thing you put the orb in and

247
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,380
 then it flies up, you can inspect that and then find the component which is responsible

248
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
 for publishing.

249
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,500
 I don't know what it's called.

250
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,540
 On there, there's a field which just says G-NEO's, and you can change that to whatever

251
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,540
 you want.

252
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,620
 But I don't know what the effect of that is.

253
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,260
 It's likely that that has no effect.

254
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,980
 There is like a more complicated sort of cataloging system for records, which are what worlds

255
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,240
 and items are, that may enable some functionality of that in the future, but is not enabling

256
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
 it right now.

257
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,980
 So I don't know what it does when you do that, but hey, maybe in the future.

258
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,300
 Brix talks a lot about the sort of system of subreddits occasionally, likening that

259
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,340
 to how that could be applied to, you know, maybe there are different lists for different

260
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,660
 things and you can publish it to, I don't know, let's just say there's a furry world

261
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,060
 list and then a regular world list and stuff like that.

262
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
 Skin on my fingers is flaking.

263
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,740
 I'm going to sort of touch something weird.

264
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,260
 Sometimes this happens when you do too much laundry or dishes.

265
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,100
 Laundry detergent is horrible, by the way.

266
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,380
 Use less of it.

267
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,380
 Look it up.

268
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,180
 You don't need to use as much as it says that you need to use.

269
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
 Anyway.

270
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,940
 Shadow says, is there documentation on previous exploits or do you prefer to keep that secret

271
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,940
 for safety reasons?

272
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,460
 NeoRc via Blender sounds interesting.

273
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,500
 I believe it's logged how it was done in the updates.

274
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,940
 Maybe we try and sort of talk about it a little bit in the updates.

275
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,340
 I don't think we'd ever be publishing reports on it.

276
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,180
 I hope that we would do in the future.

277
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,740
 Let me see.

278
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,340
 Yeah, you can see it.

279
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:03,260
 It's 2022, 128, 1335, emergency security fix, added URL input sanitation to end YouTube

280
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,700
 DL to prevent remote code execution with malicious video URLs.

281
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,140
 That was the issue there.

282
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,700
 Something to do with Blender.

283
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,100
 I think it was the when you open Blender on the way to end YouTube, there was another

284
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
 one with Blender.

285
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,220
 I might be confusing two of them because we had basically the same thing, one on end YouTube

286
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,420
 and one on Blender.

287
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,540
 The Blender one was there's a command line flag you can open Blender with where it will

288
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,540
 run a Python script.

289
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:33,240
 And so there would be a way to put a Python script somewhere in a Blender file and then

290
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,980
 run it via importing a file in Neos or something.

291
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,380
 So we just disabled the dash whatever it is in the Blender XE.

292
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,740
 There's an RC you can load with a postfix harmony patch of the world spawner.

293
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,140
 That sounds like a model plugin issue which doesn't have the same issues.

294
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,700
 There is not a list of open security issues for the reason that like they're security

295
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
 issues.

296
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,700
 So if you think it's serious, then please open a security report and we'll get back

297
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
 to you.

298
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,840
 Check the security reporting policy for more information on what we consider a security

299
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,260
 thing as well.

300
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,560
 We had a very nice report a while back that was unfortunately invalid because they had

301
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,980
 not read the security reporting policy.

302
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,940
 Morph says this is a UX question but I'm new to it and still looking through the videos

303
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,860
 you've made but is there a way to make a background of a mask 100% invisible while not using any

304
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
 text images on it?

305
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,040
 I can only seem to get it 99% before any text child disappears.

306
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,740
 Not quite sure what you're talking about there because when you add a mask, it by default

307
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:40,080
 will turn invisible until you check that like show mask graphic checkbox and then it'll

308
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,940
 like appear visible again.

309
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,940
 So I'm not quite sure.

310
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,420
 Either you're using a mask incorrectly or maybe you're misunderstanding what a mask

311
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
 does.

312
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,420
 I'm not sure.

313
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,820
 Yeah, anyone that should be able to help you out.

314
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,780
 Amber says any plans for ermai compliance?

315
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,580
 I don't know what ermai is.

316
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,740
 Is that open metaverse institute?

317
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,980
 There's a group of people that call themselves the metaverse standards group or something

318
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:15,140
 and they have documents, github issues, meetings, all sorts of stuff but I've yet to understand

319
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,980
 what they're producing and how they're producing it.

320
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:24,580
 It seems like there's a lot of conversation and information but not many actual specifications.

321
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:30,700
 I went through that entire website and I'm like can I find like an RFC or something and

322
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
 it was very confusing.

323
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,940
 I don't mean to insult them.

324
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,260
 I'm sure they're trying to get stuff together.

325
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,060
 It felt like there was a lot of bureaucracy going on there.

326
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,900
 Ozi has a question.

327
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,260
 Speaking of UX, a friend was using a UX text component and disabling the slot for visual

328
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,260
 effect.

329
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,580
 Even disabling the text component itself caused this too and disabling there is sometimes

330
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,500
 a frame or two of the entire alphabet of the font being displayed before fully going away.

331
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 Do you know what happened?

332
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 What's the cause of this?

333
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
 We couldn't nail it down.

334
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,380
 There is another one like identical to that which is when you'd like to disable an image

335
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,580
 slot sometimes you'll get like a flash of either the color of the image or a flash of

336
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
 pink.

337
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:14,860
 And I think that's got an issue so it might be the same thing.

338
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,740
 Yes I believe it's this issue here.

339
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,740
 So it might be the same thing as that one.

340
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,020
 UX sprite providers flash on image sprite changes.

341
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,420
 And there's another one, I think there's another one for like this one too.

342
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,420
 It all appears to be the same thing, which is like when you disable or enable stuff,

343
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
 weird stuff happen.

344
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,220
 Alright, let's head down to questions.

345
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,260
 Tiki says "Is there a goob way to reduce emissive on a Fresno material?"

346
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,620
 I haven't seen much use of the Fresno Imperial.

347
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,780
 Usually I don't have emissive on it, so unfortunately I don't know.

348
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,380
 Someone else may know the answer to that one.

349
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,900
 Amber says "What is the experimental write to file node?

350
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,660
 I can't find an edox on it."

351
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,360
 That's because it's experimental, so not many people use it.

352
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,100
 It's also difficult to find because it's hidden behind the show experimental checkbox in the

353
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,980
 logics tip.

354
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,700
 That one is best found in the update logs.

355
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:18,660
 I get that that's a really bad answer to that question, but we live in a society.

356
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,580
 The write to file node will write to a file, but only if your session is set to an unsafe

357
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
 mode.

358
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,020
 The unsafe mode is a checkbox when starting a session.

359
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,700
 When you set unsafe mode to true, you will be restricted to LAN-only sessions.

360
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,860
 That node was added for scientific research purposes, and is not designed to be used outside

361
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,780
 of unsafe mode sessions outside of not unsafe mode sessions.

362
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,060
 It's not designed to be used and cannot be used outside of sessions that do not have

363
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,380
 unsafe mode set.

364
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,220
 There we go, that's a mouthful.

365
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,780
 This is a big one.

366
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,660
 Threw things across the room accidentally.

367
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,700
 Let me read it.

368
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,420
 Raid says "Might not be able to explain this best, but there are cases when using dynamic

369
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,020
 variables for global values is better for performance.

370
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,660
 An example comes to mind that we'll be using user from username many times across multiple

371
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,700
 different systems in an avatar, but to be able to replace that with a dynamic variable

372
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,020
 of active user, your user is referred to a single global check for your user is not insignificant

373
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,780
 enough to be worth it outside of the workflow."

374
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,780
 If you are using user from username on an avatar, you're doing it wrong.

375
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,540
 You should use get active user or get active user self.

376
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,620
 But as an example, it's good.

377
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,860
 I understand what you're saying.

378
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:37,060
 This comes up a lot in various things I'm doing and I've kind of found a way to do it.

379
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,260
 Which is I always make a dynamic variable for it.

380
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,140
 So if like for example, I've got a bunch of panels, it's hard, like I've got a ton of panels.

381
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:50,420
 Like I've got like a graphing panel, like an avatar, impairment panel, a file writing

382
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,980
 panel, eye movement simulator panel, all sorts of medical stuff.

383
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,020
 And on all of those cases, I have a dynamic variable on that panel, which is just like

384
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,460
 panel stroke user.

385
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,180
 And it usually means like either the user we're targeting, the user who's in charge

386
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,620
 of updating the panel in the cases of like fire on true and stuff like that.

387
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,620
 I will always use that dynamic variable.

388
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,280
 There are more reasons to do that beyond performance.

389
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,300
 It's really good for sort of like updates and stuff like that.

390
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,860
 For example, if you suddenly realize, hey, the user that should be updating the system

391
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,460
 isn't the one I thought it would be, you don't have to then go unpack a bunch of logics and

392
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,540
 pull it apart and find something.

393
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,860
 You have a single place where you manage the value of that user dynamic variable and then

394
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,780
 you use that throughout there.

395
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,060
 And it sets up a sort of like, for those who know traditional programming, I apologize

396
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:48,540
 because I know it's not this, but it sets up separation of concerns such that the logic

397
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,180
 over here on the right doesn't care about the user at all.

398
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,700
 It just listens to the dynamic variable and the logics on the left is the only thing that

399
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,500
 deals with the user and it just saves it to a single dynamic variable and you don't have

400
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
 to use for it.

401
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,980
 So I do recommend that approach.

402
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,660
 When it comes to performance, it depends what nodes you use and it's really hard to measure

403
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,740
 that on like a generic area.

404
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:19,680
 User from username does have a single like update thing that occurs when the inputted

405
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,740
 username values change.

406
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:27,020
 The user from username node will have to run its code to then find that user.

407
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,060
 Additionally, when any user leaves or joins a world, it might have to run again to double

408
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,980
 check that the user from username that it returned a user for didn't disappear.

409
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,020
 So there is a cost to that.

410
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,380
 But I wouldn't be able to tell you like five, seven, like two.

411
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,380
 I don't know.

412
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,320
 I don't know like how, what percentage of that or what like part of that would be measurable.

413
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,240
 So purely from a functional point of view, I do recommend using a global user thing.

414
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,280
 If it is something that's on avatar or a tool, though, and you know it's always going to

415
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,540
 be, and I said you know it's always going to be, you have to think about the design

416
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
 of your system.

417
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,100
 If you know that it's always going to be the user that is holding, equipping, parenting

418
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,380
 to, wearing, using active user would be absolutely fine as well.

419
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,280
 Get active user self as a node is quite performance.

420
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,120
 So don't worry about using that.

421
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,700
 I myself would always use the dynamic variable because there's been like hundreds of times

422
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,940
 where I'm like, yeah, it's always the person that's wearing the avatar until it suddenly

423
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,940
 isn't.

424
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:35,300
 Like as an example, I had a scientificy thing where there was a experiment patient, I guess

425
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,180
 like patient would be a better word.

426
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,260
 I don't know.

427
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,180
 And so they were wearing an avatar and I was using get active user.

428
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,260
 But the experimenter or the researcher, which is the person conducting the experiment was

429
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,680
 the person who actually needed to like get values and do stuff with that thing that they

430
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,860
 were wearing or using or holding.

431
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,800
 And so it made more sense for it to be the experimenter user and not the user that was

432
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,200
 wearing the avatar.

433
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,380
 And so I had to swap that all over to dynamic variables and now I just do it as a variable.

434
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,380
 It's much easier.

435
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,740
 Lex has again a good idea there, which is using it for slots.

436
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
 I do that a lot.

437
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,440
 I've actually started writing a lot of logic, which is like self-contained because of that

438
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,880
 process.

439
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,220
 So it will do a bunch of operations and then it will just set the result of those operations

440
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,640
 to either a value field, which is on the slot which I pack the logics into, or on a dynamic

441
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,040
 variable that it assumes is there and if it's not there, it will create it.

442
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,720
 And that way I can basically sort of, as much as you sort of reparent a cube or something,

443
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,820
 you can reparent bits of logics around and it just works.

444
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,560
 There is a horrific piece of logic in the virtual surgery world that we have that is

445
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:47,640
 doing exactly that for detecting which bone segment this particular object is nearest

446
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,680
 to, which won't make any sense unless you know what I'm doing.

447
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,400
 If you don't know what I'm talking about when I talk about virtual surgery, then you can

448
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,500
 head over to my channel and watch a three minute presentation about virtual surgical

449
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,720
 planning inside of Neos, which I'll go get for you.

450
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
 Right.

451
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,440
 Amber asks, "Does Neos policy say not to harass users in or out of game, which is to specify

452
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
 in game?"

453
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,000
 Please always report stuff that you have concerns with, but we are less able to, and in some

454
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,040
 cases, not able to police out of game contact or content.

455
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,120
 Example here might be, let's say a Neos user that you know has a Neos account is harassing

456
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,320
 you on Roblox or VRChat.

457
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,180
 Contact Roblox or VRChat support.

458
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
 We can't help you.

459
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,320
 Do always make a ticket though, just in case.

460
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,460
 We'd love to take a look at the situation and can advise you officially there.

461
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,200
 There's just less we can do if it's off platform.

462
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,800
 And then the final question, because we are actually eight minutes over time from Lex,

463
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,880
 is "What's the least amount of users you've seen online in Neos?"

464
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,200
 Seeing as I was around back in 2019, where like next to no one played it, I want to say

465
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,080
 less than 20, back in those days, I remember the first time I played it, I was looking

466
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,920
 around in Business Lawyers Avatar Tool World, and Nexolun came in, and they looked at, like

467
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,160
 there was a table in that world, some sort of like, you know, like storage table thing,

468
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,120
 and he looked at it, and he just, he made it bigger with the developer tip, and I'm

469
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
 like, "What?"

470
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,660
 And then I just kept playing the game, and here I am.

471
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,160
 You can also look back at the videos on Frick's YouTube channel, scroll all the way to the

472
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:35,200
 bottom, and you'll see times where there are two users on Neos, and to illustrate that

473
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,960
 there are more than two users for presentational matters, they would spawn headsets in the

474
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,520
 world, and they would put Wigglers on them.

475
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,200
 The whole reason the Wiggler component exists, and also the Wiggler tip exists, is to pretend

476
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,120
 that there are additional users in a world.

477
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,320
 And with that, we will leave off there.

478
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,000
 If you have any additional questions, please go ahead and drop them in the questions and

479
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,420
 help channel, direct message me, or, I don't know, send a carrier pigeon my way, it'll

480
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,240
 know where to go, and I will speak to you again next week.
