1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
 All right, it is the-- yeah, welcome to Office Hours

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,920
 with Prime.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,600
 My name is Prime.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,040
 So I got distracted there because I set up

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,560
 automation on Google Home to turn on my living room

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,880
 lights about 4 PM, because I will continually figure out

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,520
 at about 4 PM, we start needing lights.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,840
 So they just turned on the moment Office Hours hit.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,800
 It was like, bling, your lights turned on.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,440
 And I'm like, you're listening, lights?

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,640
 What's going on?

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,440
 Well, there we go.

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,720
 Anyway, welcome to Office Hours.

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,600
 This is where I answer questions that you guys might have.

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,040
 Please drop them in the Office Hours text chat thread,

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,720
 and I'll get to them in order that they arrive.

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,420
 I'm just going to ping Office Hours again,

18
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,720
 and then we'll go ahead and get started with my questions.

19
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,640
 So Jack asks-- they first of all say party time.

20
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,360
 It's not a party.

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,120
 It's Office Hours.

22
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,600
 Very serious, Office Hours.

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,240
 You've got to put on your tweed jacket, get some coffee,

24
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,960
 and sit in the big professor hallway thing.

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,640
 Yes.

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,360
 Anyway, and then asks, how have you been?

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,240
 I am tired and itchy, and I need to go grocery shopping,

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,760
 but I'm not going grocery shopping until this is over.

29
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,040
 Yes, that's how I am.

30
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,680
 That's the only question we have so far.

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,080
 So until we have additional questions,

32
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,000
 I'm going to sit here in unimaginable silence.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,760
 So make sure you get some questions sorted.

34
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,120
 Gray Foxen says, the Prime means more British things,

35
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,920
 like bad weather and milk and tea, says Jack.

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,320
 Jack even.

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
 I have lots of British things.

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,240
 I have a cup of tea next to me.

39
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,120
 It was last night's tea, so it's empty, but you know.

40
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,360
 Svekin asks, what would be the best way to play a sound only

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,600
 when, say, a tap is being rotated and only when it's

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,840
 being rotated?

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,680
 Do remember that a joint and also a slider,

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
 they both act as actually grabables.

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,440
 They do in programming what's called

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,320
 extending from a grabable.

47
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,240
 So all of the grabable nodes work with joints and sliders.

48
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,800
 So if you want to get an event when someone starts grabbing

49
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,200
 a joint, use on grabable grab, and on grabable released,

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,240
 I think it is, when they stop grabbing a joint.

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,480
 Then based on that, you can do some logic

52
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,880
 to take a look at how fast it's being rotated

53
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,040
 or something like that to play a sound.

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,720
 In fact, if you take a look in my--

55
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,440
 this is like a random shout out.

56
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,880
 Take a look in my public folder, go to memes.

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,040
 My MMC entry there hasn't been submitted yet.

58
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,120
 It's right there at the bottom of the meme's folder.

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
 It looks like a DJ deck.

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,720
 It's called the-- forget what Windmill called it.

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,360
 They put it on Twitter a long, long time ago.

62
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,040
 I can't find it.

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
 Anyway, it's in the public folder there.

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,600
 It's like a DJ deck, but it's like a kid's version of that.

65
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,480
 It's been me.

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,520
 Anyway, that has some logic on it,

67
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,600
 which enables you to do the traditional DJ scratching

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,320
 stuff.

69
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,760
 But that is on a joint, because you

70
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,480
 have to spin the disk around to do DJ disk scratching.

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,320
 And so take a look at that logic and how we are driving

72
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,600
 the playback of that disk.

73
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,400
 That comes from an old object, which I had in my inventory,

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,160
 which is just like a regular cylinder that you can scratch

75
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,160
 again, like a DJ, which has the bass part sound effect on it.

76
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,040
 So I just stole that logic from there.

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,960
 And then you can take a look at that.

78
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,040
 It uses Drive playback.

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,920
 By using Drive playback, you can work out

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,920
 if it's rotating, go to the speed,

81
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,200
 if you're rotating it faster, maybe speed it up a little bit

82
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,240
 or stuff like that.

83
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,680
 I think I also updated it so that if the sound isn't playing,

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,720
 the audio output turns off, which is always good.

85
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,280
 When you aren't using Play OneShot,

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,440
 if the sound isn't playing, you should turn the audio output

87
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
 off wherever possible.

88
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,780
 Jack says, do you drink tea or milk?

89
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,680
 No.

90
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,120
 Milk does not belong in tea.

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,960
 There's like a-- where are we?

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,840
 I'll try and find this.

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,760
 I can't find it, but it's one of those sketch channels

94
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
 where they show someone making tea,

95
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,840
 and then they get all aggressive because they're doing it wrong.

96
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
 I can't find the video.

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,280
 Anyway, the point being is tea should be--

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,800
 you should be able to taste it.

99
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
 The amount of times in the UK particularly where I get tea,

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,720
 which is basically just milk, is really annoying.

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,240
 It's really, really annoying.

102
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,560
 Tea needs to brew.

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
 Traditional sort of breakfast regular tea

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,960
 that you'd get if you said tea to a British person,

105
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,680
 that doesn't need to brew for as long as you think it does.

106
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,720
 It doesn't need a full three minutes,

107
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
 but it does need some time.

108
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,200
 Don't just show the teabag to the water.

109
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,240
 You got to let it brew.

110
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,800
 Green teas and stuff like that that I drink, three minutes.

111
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,960
 I have a Google Home routine.

112
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,840
 Tea time.

113
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
 All right, three minutes, starting now.

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,600
 So that's what my phone does when I say tea time to it,

115
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,880
 because it just knows three minutes is right for tea.

116
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,720
 Anyway, moving on to actual Nia's questions

117
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,240
 rather than tea questions.

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
 Jack says, are there plans for improving

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,960
 the undo system in general?

120
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,800
 Yes, so the problem with the undo system is it's opt in.

121
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,640
 So every single technical system has to opt into it.

122
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,880
 So that's why you'll see that certain operations don't

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,160
 have undos or do have undos.

124
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,560
 I'm going to say the word do a lot,

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,840
 so if you get giggly when I say the word doo-doo,

126
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,240
 then you're in for it, right?

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
 So when something needs to be undoed,

128
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
 it needs to register with the undo system.

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,680
 And not everything does register with the undo system,

130
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,280
 so it can't be undone.

131
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,440
 Additionally, some activities are just incompatible

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
 with the undo system.

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,840
 So we are investigating that whenever we can.

134
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,440
 As a reminder, you can also use the undo nodes yourself

135
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,360
 to make your tool undo compatible.

136
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,240
 The first time I did that was a line tip.

137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,760
 I believe that's still in my public file drive, the tools.

138
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,200
 It just creates lines.

139
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,840
 That is full undo compatible, and it was a lot of effort.

140
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,160
 The tool worked, and then I had to add undo capability to it.

141
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,360
 And it took about as long as making the tool to then add

142
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,520
 undo capabilities to it.

143
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
 So do keep that in mind.

144
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,120
 If you want that in your tools, maybe start building there.

145
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,000
 Other things like limiting the amount of undo steps,

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,800
 maybe increasing the amount of undo steps,

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,520
 doing sort of like undo all would be good for those times

148
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,320
 where something wrong just happens.

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,240
 Like, whoops, I made the floor grabable,

150
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,560
 and then someone grabbed it and turned it upside down.

151
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,680
 It'd just be like, all right, stop, undo everything

152
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,320
 would be also a good feature.

153
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,120
 Make sure you have GitHub issues in for any advancements

154
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,520
 to come to your system that you'd like.

155
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
 Digin Bites says, isn't just hot chocolate just bean tea?

156
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,480
 Our chocolate's a little bit different

157
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,520
 because it usually has a lot more ingredients.

158
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,840
 So the thing with coffee, or proper coffee,

159
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
 is it's just the ground up bean.

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,040
 The thing with tea is it's just sort of the leaf.

161
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,920
 And then depending on what type of leaf it is,

162
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,600
 it's ground up leaf or full leaf tea.

163
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
 Always go for full leaf tea.

164
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,520
 I'll link my place where I get tea from in a moment.

165
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,000
 The hot chocolate, though, is like a bunch of stuff.

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,720
 Usually hot chocolate powder includes cocoa, sugar,

167
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,440
 and powdered milk so that you just

168
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,280
 have to pour hot water into it.

169
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,760
 So it's complicated.

170
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,680
 It's almost like hot chocolate is a soup

171
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
 because there's more ingredients.

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
 Boba tea is gross.

173
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,640
 I'll tell you why it's gross.

174
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,400
 And that's because I frequently end up with a clogged straw.

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,040
 And then I have to suck harder.

176
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,480
 And then the tapioca balls in Boba tea

177
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,680
 then shotgun into the back of my throat.

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,040
 And being gross for just a second,

179
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,800
 it feels like throwing up in reverse.

180
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,120
 And I don't-- no, no, I don't want that.

181
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,640
 Let's move on to the next question.

182
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,080
 Digembite also asks, is NeosVR still using crypto,

183
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,520
 and is it sorted with the owners?

184
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,800
 OK, so for that one, you can read the announcements

185
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,120
 channel for any updates.

186
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,000
 Before you say there are no updates available,

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
 I want you to read the announcements channel again,

188
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,720
 because that's the only updates that we have for that matter.

189
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,360
 Nothing has changed in that regard.

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,760
 If something does change, it will

191
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,920
 be in the announcements channel before it is here.

192
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,720
 So before you ask any other team member, including Mr. Frixius,

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
 the announcements channel is where you want to go.

194
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
 Like, I know people just go around Neos,

195
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,440
 and they're like, I'm going to find a team member

196
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,280
 and ask them the Carol questions.

197
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,960
 The answer is the same.

198
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,400
 Nothing has changed.

199
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,920
 Read the announcements channel.

200
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
 So Jack has clarified that they want the ability

201
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,080
 to prevent stuff from making undos in certain situations.

202
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,560
 Were you the person who was asking

203
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,760
 about doing that for gameplay-related matters?

204
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,080
 Because, yeah, that was an interesting one.

205
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,640
 Basically, if it's like a--

206
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,440
 I don't know-- sacrifice the magic gem you've just

207
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,400
 got from the water temple to the god to win the game,

208
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,600
 and then you just give it to the water god, the god goes, yay,

209
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,720
 and then animation plays.

210
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,800
 And then you just undo, and then you've got the crystal bag.

211
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,920
 It's kind of like, whoops, time to cheat.

212
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,440
 I can imagine there being a shop interface where

213
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,080
 I made this really cool thing.

214
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,840
 I want to sell it to a shopkeeper,

215
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,040
 put it on the shopkeeper's table, undo.

216
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,520
 I got another one.

217
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,160
 I got another one.

218
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,800
 I've got another one.

219
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,360
 Great, yeah, so certainly something we need to look at.

220
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,680
 So to go make sure that there's a garbage for it.

221
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,480
 I do like that people are thinking about games more.

222
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,040
 Seems to happen only during MMC.

223
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,800
 Remember that there are 12 months in the year.

224
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
 For the entirety of the 12 months,

225
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,440
 you can make games in Neos.

226
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,400
 I love seeing them.

227
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,040
 So I'm going to play as many of those games that

228
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,400
 come out in the MMC, which is going to be out soon,

229
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,920
 like eight days or something like that.

230
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,160
 Moving forwards, Digium says, did Neos VR

231
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,800
 know Neo crypto already existed?

232
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,240
 That's nothing to do with Neos.

233
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,200
 There are many cryptocurrencies that

234
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,280
 use the sort of futuristic words in their naming.

235
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,720
 Neos is also, I believe, a medical device manufacturer

236
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,960
 or something like that.

237
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,960
 It's a bit like I used to work for the streaming site Mixer.

238
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,520
 Mixer used to be called Beam.

239
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,960
 And we had to change its name because we couldn't actually

240
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,160
 get a global trademark on Beam.

241
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,520
 One of the reasons behind that is

242
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,200
 that there was a Beam telepresence robot, where

243
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
 you could remotely steer a robot around an office.

244
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,440
 And there was also a vacuum cleaner.

245
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,600
 It was called a Beam vacuum cleaner or something like that.

246
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
 So we couldn't get the global trademark on that.

247
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
 So it was very interesting.

248
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
 It's nothing to do with us.

249
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,200
 So I don't know enough about crypto,

250
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,560
 but I know that you can't just randomly combine coins,

251
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,020
 particularly if they're not already.

252
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,600
 It's like saying, yo, guys, let's take United States

253
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,280
 dollars and Canadian dollars and merge them together

254
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,960
 because they're both called dollars.

255
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,800
 That's as much sense as that question you asked, Mix.

256
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
 It's just a naming thing.

257
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
 There's also Australian dollars as well.

258
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,560
 Should we combine Canadian, United States,

259
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,360
 and Australian dollars together into a global dollar?

260
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,720
 And before you ask, yeah, I know that's exactly what euros did.

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,400
 But Europe is very weird.

262
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,080
 There's this thing called European Union,

263
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,080
 which makes stuff happen really fast in Europe, which

264
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,380
 the UK is no longer a part of.

265
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,920
 But that's a topic for another day

266
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,560
 when I turn into a political commentator, which I'm not.

267
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,580
 So I don't care to comment on it.

268
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,560
 Digium asks, authentication via Steam support.

269
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,560
 I'm not a fan of logging in like it's 1995.

270
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,020
 Logging in with a username and password is actually sometimes

271
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,820
 the most secure operation when it comes to third parties

272
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,060
 holding your identity.

273
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,180
 As a good example here, think about all the times

274
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,340
 where you've logged into a website with Google.

275
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,340
 So you've gone to, I don't know, just a random website.

276
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,680
 A common one I was seeing today because I was helping someone

277
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,020
 out with job applications is they

278
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,020
 could log into this job application website

279
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,300
 with their Google account.

280
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,260
 Let's now imagine that Google goes bust,

281
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,060
 or your Google account gets canceled for various reasons.

282
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,260
 You now longer can actually log into that account

283
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,660
 because you logged in with Google,

284
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,260
 because you handed your authentication

285
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,060
 to a third party.

286
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,340
 So I don't like the implication that logging

287
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,860
 in with your own username and password is old or outdated.

288
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,660
 Hence the comment about 1995.

289
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,100
 However, we will be looking at additional authentication

290
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,940
 options in the future and additionally

291
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,940
 looking at increasing that Remember Me,

292
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,700
 because right now Remember Me is just a seven day rolling window.

293
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
 We could maybe make that a 30 day rolling window

294
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,940
 or forever rolling window, depending on what we're doing.

295
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,260
 Jack says, no, they're using sliders

296
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,860
 for custom directional inputs.

297
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
 Basically managing the position of myself,

298
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,140
 the ability to undo transform brings a lot of complexity

299
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,940
 and having to-- yeah, yeah.

300
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,220
 It's like the same problem.

301
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,500
 You want to prevent the undo, but for a completely different

302
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,700
 reason.

303
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,860
 Drafty-- I almost called you drafty, I apologize--

304
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,940
 says any improvement on the deselect all bones,

305
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,460
 so it only deselects your selection instead of deselecting

306
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,620
 everything, including other people's selection.

307
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,620
 The problem with that one is actually like a data model

308
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,140
 thing.

309
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,060
 It's similar to the logics interface problem,

310
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,460
 but a little bit different.

311
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,380
 So gizmos, which are the things that you deselect

312
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,340
 when you deselect all, those are generated on the host.

313
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,020
 They're not generated on the client.

314
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,020
 And so when you do the select all,

315
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,620
 we have no way currently to tell who owns what gizmo.

316
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,500
 So what would need to be happening--

317
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,180
 yeah, English is strange-- for that to happen

318
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,940
 is that we change up the gizmo system.

319
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,860
 So one of two things happens.

320
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,180
 Either the gizmos register or shoulder tap each other

321
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,300
 to say, I was created by drafty, I was created by Jack.

322
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,100
 And that way, we'd be able to deselect everything correctly.

323
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,980
 Or we would have to change up the gizmos

324
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,620
 so that they're generated on the host, which then naturally would

325
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,500
 have that whole ownership thing.

326
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,660
 Not the host, the user.

327
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,160
 Because then the user would be like,

328
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,660
 I have generated a gizmo host.

329
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,860
 And the host would be like, oh, thank you

330
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
 for generating a gizmo.

331
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,220
 I now know that you own that.

332
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,540
 So both of those things are possible.

333
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,500
 They just require updates to how our data model operates.

334
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,180
 There are lots of tools.

335
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,600
 I like the sort of radial one, which

336
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,060
 will delete gizmos that are within a certain radius

337
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,220
 of the person.

338
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,720
 That's good.

339
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,140
 Because it means if you're working

340
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,180
 in a corner of the map, you can deselect just stuff

341
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,320
 that's within a meter or two of you,

342
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,100
 and it's usually the problem, rather than map-wide.

343
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,020
 I have something which basically does the same as the material

344
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,460
 tip area mode, where I can turn a mode on the tool,

345
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,140
 or I can just sort of wave a collider over a gizmo

346
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,180
 that I don't want.

347
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,660
 That's complicated to access.

348
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,020
 I know that a lot of people have got this shake to deselect

349
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,260
 thing.

350
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,140
 I want to move over to my tool at some point.

351
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,060
 But I keep forgetting, so that's fine.

352
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,820
 Digiamp says, with the whole currency thing, it's more,

353
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,140
 why not use an established coin rather than a new one?

354
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,520
 I have no idea what the motivations of the original ICO

355
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,160
 were.

356
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,400
 I know that it's too late to switch to another coin.

357
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,960
 Read announcements for information.

358
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,080
 I think we're done talking about coins and currencies

359
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,880
 in crypto.

360
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,100
 Jack asks for hardware 2FA.

361
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,040
 Yes, there is a doobly-doo for that.

362
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,360
 However, until we have that implemented in Neos,

363
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,600
 did you know that you can store 2FA secrets on hardware

364
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
 security?

365
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,800
 What you do is you go download from your phone.

366
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
 You download Yubico Authenticator.

367
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,520
 And then what Yubico Authenticator requires

368
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,240
 is that you have to either plug in--

369
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,080
 or if you've got one of the NMCs, Yubico things,

370
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,640
 you can put that on the back of the phone in a C chip.

371
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,020
 And that's the only way you can access your 2FA stuff.

372
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,100
 I'm moving some of my 2FA to that

373
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,560
 because it protects you against the whole phone thing.

374
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,300
 Most 2FA problems occur with, I got a new phone,

375
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,320
 and I was careless when I got my new phone.

376
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,500
 And I didn't move my 2FA over before I lost my old phone.

377
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,440
 We get a lot of that in support.

378
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,220
 So if you are getting a new phone, you move your 2FA first.

379
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,880
 You can also use services like Authy,

380
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,360
 where it will migrate your 2FA to your new phone.

381
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,320
 I question the security of that one,

382
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,860
 hence why I'm moving over to Yubico-related stuff.

383
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,080
 But then again, I've moved the problem.

384
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,880
 Instead of, have I lost my phone or I've got a new phone,

385
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,280
 it's like, have I lost the YubiKey?

386
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,120
 So you always have a backup one.

387
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
 And ideally, that backup one should

388
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,260
 be moved or stored offsite.

389
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,160
 A safety deposit box at a bank would

390
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,520
 be the paranoid way of doing it.

391
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,280
 Did Jim clarify, is with Auth, you still

392
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,620
 have access to an email, an option to recover a password?

393
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,680
 Yeah, that means there's two options.

394
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,060
 You've linked your Steam account,

395
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,640
 or you've linked your Google account.

396
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,280
 You can log in with that one for speed.

397
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,020
 But you can also log in with your password

398
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,000
 should you lose that Google connectivity.

399
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,800
 However, that kind of just moves the problem.

400
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
 Because what the other thing you're doing there

401
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
 is you're saying, what you're really saying is,

402
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,840
 it is easier to maintain a session on Google

403
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,160
 than it is to maintain a session on Neos or Steam

404
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,280
 than it is on Neos.

405
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,720
 And so what you're really, really saying there,

406
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,080
 if you look at the crux of it, is

407
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,160
 you're saying, I want it to be easier

408
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,280
 to maintain a session on Neos.

409
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,160
 And there are a bunch of ways to do that that aren't strictly

410
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,640
 just Steam login.

411
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,440
 Great.

412
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,520
 Make sure to just refer to the announcement section.

413
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,960
 It's like, you said things that are completely rumors,

414
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,200
 and I have no comment about those rumors.

415
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,560
 Just stick to the announcements.

416
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,880
 I just hear rumors all the time, and I'm like, none of these

417
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,840
 are even remotely true.

418
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,280
 It's like, rumor, Prime has pink hair.

419
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,800
 There you go.

420
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,040
 There's a free rumor.

421
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,520
 Free rumor.

422
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,520
 Everyone's just like, hmm, I'm going to sit here and come up

423
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,280
 with random things that don't make any sense

424
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,520
 about this current situation.

425
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,480
 And I'm like, well, if you want the actual answer

426
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
 about what's actually happening, you

427
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,520
 could just read the announcements channel.

428
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,600
 People are like, no, I would rather have rumors.

429
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,440
 I'm like, OK, fine.

430
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,560
 I've got pink hair then.

431
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,760
 I should complete that meme now.

432
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,560
 I should just turn up to a random convention

433
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,480
 with pink hair.

434
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,600
 Oh, here's a good question.

435
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,040
 Thank you so much, Shadow.

436
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,480
 Back on topic now.

437
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,280
 Shadow has 2FA set up, but they've never

438
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
 been asked for it when logging in.

439
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,960
 Is there supposed-- yes, there is.

440
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,760
 So once you have 2FA enabled, 2FA

441
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,520
 was originally added to Neos primarily

442
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,160
 for NCR-related transactions.

443
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,240
 So by default, it is not enabled for you to log in.

444
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,440
 You can read the 2FA page on the Neos Wiki

445
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,240
 here, which will show you how to do it.

446
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,200
 But if you want to be asked for your 2FA when you log in,

447
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,480
 you can just send enable login 2FA to the Neos bot.

448
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,120
 And then it will require your 2FA doobly-doo when you log in.

449
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,480
 If you don't do that, it won't require it when you log in.

450
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,200
 It is weird.

451
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,960
 I wish it was just more clear.

452
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,720
 But we are having a lot of difficulty

453
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,840
 with users not understanding the severity of 2FA.

454
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,520
 But you know when you set up 2FA, and it's like,

455
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,880
 save these backup codes, people just go like,

456
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,840
 this information isn't for me.

457
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
 Where's the-- what is it?

458
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,000
 Yeah, there we go.

459
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,240
 This meme image, it's like, that side

460
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,280
 can't stop me because I can't read.

461
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,600
 Save your backup codes.

462
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
 We really do mean it.

463
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,000
 Technically speaking, if we were following

464
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,120
 the letter of the law about two-factor authentication

465
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,960
 and two-factor security and stuff like that,

466
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,480
 if you lost your backup codes and your 2FA device,

467
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,160
 we should not recover your account.

468
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,680
 Because we have no current way to prove that you are there.

469
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,720
 So if you do lose that, do drop in a ticket.

470
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,040
 We might be able to help you out.

471
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,400
 But you need to follow the instructions.

472
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,120
 So if any of you here have not saved your backup codes,

473
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,840
 please go disable 2FA using your current 2FA device.

474
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,480
 And then re-enable 2FA and save the new backup codes

475
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,560
 that we give you.

476
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,920
 Put them in a Notepad document.

477
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,280
 Put that Notepad document on a flash drive.

478
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,520
 Then throw that flash drive somewhere in your house

479
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,680
 where you know where it is.

480
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,600
 Moving forwards, away from 2FA, Draphey says,

481
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,680
 can we expect the ability to host headless servers

482
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,480
 without the need of Patreon in the future?

483
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,600
 That's an interesting thing because those

484
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,720
 are like beta features.

485
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,320
 It's weird when we are like a beta application that's

486
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,960
 early access that then also has beta features.

487
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,920
 So the Patreon thing is to reward

488
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,200
 people who support the product, who support Neos,

489
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
 with additional features that we are testing.

490
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,840
 And once headless servers are more standardized, better,

491
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,520
 smoother, easier to use, we will then

492
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,080
 move out of the Patreon pool and it'll become a global feature.

493
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,160
 Of course, right now, read the announcements channel.

494
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,000
 We aren't going to be changing anything about headless

495
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,120
 for the foreseeable future.

496
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,080
 When we do, you'll be seeing that in the announcements

497
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,400
 channel.

498
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,200
 Until then, yes, you'll unfortunately need the Patreon.

499
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,880
 Having said that, though, the only thing

500
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,600
 that requires you to access the Patreon is that headless key.

501
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,720
 So you can go ahead and get that headless Patreon-y doodad

502
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,120
 and get that headless key and do whatever you would like.

503
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,000
 The Bumble, I think I'm reading that correctly

504
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,220
 with the numbers there, bouncingbises asks,

505
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,560
 bouncing out of the game, I've been

506
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,720
 trying to work on a game on Neos and still new to Neos.

507
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,200
 I saw the same issue where users can duplicate stuff.

508
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,280
 So my work around so far has been to make a unique hash

509
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,240
 to an object.

510
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
 If it finds the world again, auto deletes it.

511
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,880
 So the permanent option will be awesome.

512
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,560
 Oh, there are a couple of tagging components which

513
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,240
 prevent the duplicate button.

514
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,360
 So you know the context menu that says duplicate?

515
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,760
 There is a way to prevent that.

516
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,720
 And there's also a way to prevent it from being deleted.

517
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,240
 Those, of course, don't work if someone's got an inspector

518
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,120
 or if they've got builder access because they could just

519
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
 duplicate it or delete it using the inspector, which

520
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,320
 will bypass those checks.

521
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,560
 But if they're in a game map where you haven't given them

522
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,240
 builder permission and the only way that they can duplicate it

523
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,520
 is by using the context menu, then you can block that.

524
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
 I have a video on my channel called Useful Tagging

525
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,240
 Components.

526
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,760
 I believe Froppy is probably rushing to YouTube

527
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,800
 to get it right now.

528
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,400
 If you won't, I'm sorry, Froppy, but I'm just preempting you.

529
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,000
 That's usually what happens.

530
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,700
 Either way, I'll grab it in a few minutes

531
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,080
 if Froppy hasn't grabbed it already.

532
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,160
 See, Shadow says, thanks for reminding me my codes are

533
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,320
 on a PC I don't use anymore.

534
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,760
 You see, you ought to think about it.

535
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,220
 There are ways to look at security,

536
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,400
 and it depends on your attack vector or your threat model,

537
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,520
 et cetera, is what would happen tomorrow

538
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,200
 if your house set fire?

539
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,960
 And think about that both from a personal possessions--

540
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,400
 so maybe there's a photo album somewhere,

541
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
 something sentimental that you would need--

542
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,240
 but also from your digital identity as well.

543
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,560
 Your house sets on fire.

544
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,760
 You can't access any of the devices that you're on.

545
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,520
 Maybe your phone even gets lost because the house set fire

546
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,900
 and you just had to run.

547
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,280
 How difficult would it be for you to do very important

548
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,400
 things-- access your finances, let people know you're OK,

549
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,720
 organize insurance claims?

550
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,880
 Think about that, and then adjust your life

551
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,000
 if those answers aren't easy.

552
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,360
 Moving forward to Jidget--

553
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,760
 [LAUGHS]

554
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,640
 I'm getting like halfway through office hours.

555
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,960
 I just lose the ability to speak.

556
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,400
 I'm just going to roll around on the floor drooling in a second.

557
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,200
 DiginBite says, any plans to make Neos more user accessible?

558
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,540
 I found new installs seem to force the tutorial to escape.

559
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,280
 That's actually our plan to make it more accessible,

560
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,200
 which is a weird problem that we have.

561
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,680
 We are finding, just generally, that it's

562
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,360
 very difficult to tutor people who

563
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,720
 have different expectations of what a tutorial should be.

564
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,840
 So some users come in and they don't know VR.

565
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,820
 So they need to be shown their controllers

566
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,980
 and like, this is a button.

567
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,320
 This is how you push the button.

568
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,480
 This is what the button does.

569
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,180
 Some people come in and they're rushing

570
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,700
 because they're trying to meet up with their friends.

571
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,880
 They're like, I don't care about this tutorial.

572
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,280
 I don't want to read it because I'm

573
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,000
 rushing to meet up with my friend

574
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,720
 and chill out and hang out.

575
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
 And some people come in and they're experts.

576
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,340
 And they're like, I know everything.

577
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,600
 And I don't want to be taught.

578
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,680
 I know everything.

579
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,080
 I know that you're telling me that I don't,

580
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,920
 but I know everything.

581
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,840
 Get out of my way.

582
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,000
 And so we're trying to find a way that sort of level

583
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,760
 sets that.

584
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,380
 And the only thing that we found so far that to do that

585
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,560
 is to actually force you to go through the tutorial.

586
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,080
 Because those who know what they're doing

587
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,380
 can just spam through it.

588
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,680
 Those who don't know what they're doing

589
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,280
 will usually follow the tutorial.

590
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,680
 And those that are really, really annoyed that you're

591
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,800
 forced through the tutorial will add skip intro tutorial

592
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
 as a command line argument to the shortcut

593
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,920
 they use to run the game.

594
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,240
 I'm one of those guys.

595
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,560
 So I never see the tutorial.

596
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,800
 It's an interesting problem.

597
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
 We're trying to solve it.

598
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,680
 We've got-- we want to do more MTC updates to make

599
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,280
 that experience better.

600
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,600
 It is what we've got, though.

601
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,440
 I don't think it's the problem that's making

602
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,560
 Neos not user accessible.

603
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,840
 I think that problem actually occurs when it happens,

604
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,040
 is when you go past that tutorial.

605
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,840
 We then don't follow up with additional tutorials

606
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,200
 or additional information or additional documentation

607
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,240
 inside the game.

608
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,280
 All of it's outside, or you have to ask someone

609
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,840
 which is effectively outside.

610
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,440
 Moving forwards.

611
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,720
 If you lose your backup code, you

612
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,680
 need to prove your identity by beating Prime in a chess match.

613
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
 That'd actually be quite easy.

614
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,720
 I'm not that good at chess.

615
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
 Random side note here.

616
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,720
 I was exploring VR chat worlds many years ago.

617
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,120
 And a world came up in the world's browser

618
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,040
 called Daddy's Chess Dungeon.

619
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,720
 And I'm like, what is this?

620
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,120
 This sounds risky.

621
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,680
 This sounds like maybe I need to be at a private session

622
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
 to go into this world.

623
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,560
 No, it was literally just a dark room with a chess board in it

624
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,280
 made by a guy called Daddy.

625
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,640
 So it sounded rude, but it wasn't at all.

626
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,520
 It was just a chess board in a dark room.

627
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
 That was funny.

628
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,040
 The associations we have of various words and concepts

629
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,840
 lead you down a different path.

630
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,680
 Stifle linked to the useful tagging components.

631
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,600
 Great.

632
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,000
 Digium says, how about a menu dialogue option for skip

633
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,400
 tutorial basics in advance?

634
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,520
 We have discussed having a skip tutorial button.

635
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,240
 The problem is that people that need the tutorial

636
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,040
 would push it.

637
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
 People don't want to learn sometimes.

638
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,560
 And sometimes you have to sort of guide them and force them

639
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,320
 to learn.

640
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,040
 It is a problem.

641
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,440
 I do agree that it could be better.

642
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,840
 And the content team are looking at that

643
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,160
 and trying to make that better as they go.

644
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,920
 Any feedback that you have would be great.

645
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,080
 I think there's some issues for it.

646
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,200
 I also think there was an issue where we discussed the skip

647
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,960
 button.

648
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,740
 And that's where you can read the historical conversation

649
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,440
 about why that doesn't exist.

650
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,280
 If you struggle with the tutorial at a later point

651
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,560
 and you're frustrated by it, if the cage is up at the MTC,

652
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,680
 just spam the next button.

653
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,280
 It'll go down.

654
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,920
 You don't have to do anything on the screen.

655
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,960
 But you see, that's a problem now.

656
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,040
 Because now I'm going to tell you that.

657
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,120
 And you're going to tell other people.

658
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,960
 And then no one's going to read the tutorial.

659
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
 And then no one learns.

660
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,020
 So you see, it's like a chicken and egg problem.

661
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,440
 It's like we want people to learn.

662
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,520
 But people don't like the way that we're teaching them.

663
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,440
 So they're going to skip it.

664
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
 So they can't learn.

665
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
 So we need to improve it.

666
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,520
 But we don't know how to improve it

667
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
 without forcing them to learn.

668
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,200
 It's difficult.

669
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,680
 Jack says, looking forward to exploring the MSC entries,

670
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,280
 by the way.

671
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,040
 Yep, I am.

672
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,720
 Immediate thing I have to do once the MSC entry closes

673
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,300
 is go test the voting system, though,

674
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,060
 because that's my responsibility.

675
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,780
 The Bumble says, is there a tutorial on gesture shortcuts?

676
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,360
 I think there's something somewhere that does them.

677
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,020
 I'm not sure if it's in the MTC.

678
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,420
 But there certainly is something.

679
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,220
 Why is my phone--

680
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,660
 like, hello, phone?

681
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,540
 The screen just turned on and was like, hello.

682
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,380
 And I'm like, is that a call?

683
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,220
 That usually means a call.

684
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,060
 But it wasn't a call.

685
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,020
 Very confused.

686
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,520
 Yeah, if you go back to the MTC, I think part of the problem

687
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,140
 is actually us calling it MTC.

688
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,100
 It's meant to be the metaverse training center.

689
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,380
 But if it was actually called tutorial, click here.

690
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,180
 Or maybe put a neon sign around it,

691
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,820
 like tutorials with a big arrow.

692
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,300
 It might be easier to find it.

693
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,920
 Something I think we need to do a lot,

694
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,780
 and I think that will actually help a lot,

695
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,380
 but we need to find out where we do it,

696
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,340
 is when you change worlds in VRChat,

697
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,900
 they display little announcements to you

698
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,980
 whilst it's loading.

699
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,020
 The world is loading.

700
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,220
 And it says, remember, these things are against the rules.

701
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,740
 You can report rules with the Report button.

702
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,420
 Or it says, here's how to do this thing.

703
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,580
 And you might not read them because you've

704
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,740
 seen them so much, or maybe you're an expert.

705
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,260
 But the information is still there.

706
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,620
 And you still process them a little bit.

707
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,040
 So it still reinforces that in your head.

708
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,100
 And it gives them an opportunity to do updates and announcements

709
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,620
 there.

710
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,900
 Maybe their rules change, they could put an announcement

711
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,520
 there.

712
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,860
 So we certainly need something like that somewhere.

713
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,620
 I don't know where.

714
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,500
 I like the fact that you can load into a world

715
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,940
 and have a loading screen.

716
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,620
 We need somewhere to put little messages like that, though.

717
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,380
 Robbie says, have the loading tips been narrated by Audiobook

718
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:37,900
 Prime?

719
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,300
 It is a common thing as well.

720
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,860
 I seem to remember the first game I remembered seeing it on

721
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,420
 was Fallout 3 or something.

722
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,780
 I'm not sure if that's the first game that actually did it.

723
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,540
 It's the first one I remember.

724
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,560
 I'd got an Xbox.

725
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,700
 I put in Fallout 3.

726
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,480
 And I'd loaded it.

727
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,340
 And it was like, I don't know, because I don't remember much

728
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,860
 of Fallout.

729
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,420
 But like, rockets are good at exploding things,

730
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,880
 would be like a loading screen tip.

731
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,460
 But you're like, got it.

732
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,980
 Understood.

733
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,340
 Understand that rockets are good at exploding things.

734
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,980
 Gray Foxen asks, can I help you try and break the voting system?

735
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,060
 Nope.

736
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,660
 We've tested it sufficiently to know that it is OK.

737
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,900
 It is not foolproof.

738
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,540
 So I have to watch it like a hawk.

739
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,140
 And I also have a 10-step validation process

740
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,780
 that happens once voting closes to validate each vote.

741
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,340
 So it's fun.

742
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,220
 There's a huge problem with electronic voting.

743
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,940
 It's basically just fraught with error.

744
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,620
 You can find information about that on a Tom Scott video,

745
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,900
 which I've got linked somewhere.

746
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,740
 So I have to be really careful and take a look at it.

747
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,860
 I also use pivot tables.

748
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,580
 Does anyone know what a pivot table is?

749
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,900
 I take the output, which is a CSV,

750
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,700
 and then I put it into like a--

751
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,620
 not that one.

752
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,060
 That's the wrong video.

753
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,780
 But it's OK.

754
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,820
 That's a good video for the voting system.

755
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,780
 Here's the right video.

756
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,860
 There we go.

757
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,860
 But yeah, I take the output as a CSV, convert it to Excel,

758
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,020
 and then I use a pivot table.

759
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,820
 Pivot tables are amazing.

760
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,460
 All right, we are at time.

761
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,180
 So if anyone's typing any questions, go for it.

762
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,460
 But take a look.

763
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,900
 Make sure I'm not missing any additional questions.

764
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,100
 If anyone's typing a question, go for it.

765
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,100
 But we'll cut off questions that people are typing very soon.

766
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,460
 I'll get those in.

767
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,860
 We'll keep that in mind.

768
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,620
 Jackal says that if they need a voice for stuff like loading

769
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,980
 screens, I'll do it for free.

770
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,100
 We'll keep that in mind.

771
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,660
 It's an interesting take, because I

772
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,140
 was looking at the locale files, and we

773
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,660
 need to go back through anyone that's contributed to the locale

774
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,220
 and get them to sign some paperwork at some point.

775
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,380
 It's going to be interesting.

776
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,100
 It's basically like we don't technically

777
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,900
 own the contributions.

778
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,860
 We don't have a license to their contribution,

779
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
 so it's a bit weird.

780
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,140
 We need to go back and do that.

781
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,500
 Contributed license agreement or something like that

782
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,580
 is usually what we need.

783
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,820
 We need to go back and do that.

784
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,340
 But that only matters once we start

785
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,420
 putting from locale again.

786
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,220
 So I'll sort it out eventually.

787
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,940
 I remember every year, someone ends up managing

788
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,260
 to break one of the booths.

789
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,020
 The way it works is we've got 10 booths, five on the left

790
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,060
 and five on the right.

791
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,700
 And I always have to put red tape,

792
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,260
 caution tape or closed tape over one of the booths,

793
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,500
 because someone always ends up managing to break one of them.

794
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,700
 And then what I do is I look for--

795
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,500
 oh, look, there's no one voting right now.

796
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,660
 I can quickly restart the world.

797
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,220
 And that will kick one of the broken voting booths

798
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,100
 back into there.

799
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,340
 I do have the idle restart on, but sometimes I

800
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,980
 just want to make it work again so that I can figure it out

801
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,100
 in a way that makes it make sense.

802
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,620
 With that, I think we're at the end.

803
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,660
 If you have any additional questions,

804
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,260
 please feel free to direct message me,

805
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,740
 drop it in the questions and help channel,

806
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,900
 send me carrier pigeons, whatever you want to do.

807
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,980
 Smoke signals, I don't know, lasers, moss code,

808
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
 whatever you want to do.

809
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,300
 I'm happy to help you out.

810
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,620
 Good luck with your MMC entries.

811
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,540
 Do you remember to submit the world early?

812
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,820
 I'm going to tell you again, submit the world early.

813
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,660
 You don't need to wait till the world is finished before you

814
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,980
 put it on that submission plate.

815
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,020
 And for the last day of the MMC, you

816
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,060
 shouldn't be making edits.

817
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,260
 You should be testing.

818
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,660
 What happens for desktop users?

819
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,340
 What happens for more than one user?

820
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,700
 Can this be broken?

821
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,020
 What happens for users that may be a color blind?

822
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,540
 What happens for users who are deaf?

823
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,060
 What happens for users who are blind?

824
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,380
 Well, blind's like a strange one.

825
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,020
 Partially sighted would be a better term.

826
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,340
 Visually impaired, whatever phrasing you want to use there.

827
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,980
 And I will speak to you again soon.
